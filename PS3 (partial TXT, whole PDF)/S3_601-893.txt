SRES versus IS92a
•  In broad terms, the temperature results from SRES are similar to the IS92a results. In each of the two SRES and IS92a cases,
warming is in excess of 40% above the global average in Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, northern Asia, and Tibet (ALA,
GRL, NAS and TIB) in DJF and in central Asia and Tibet (CAS and TIB) in JJA. All four cases also show warming less than
the global average in South and Southeast Asia, and southern South America (SAS, SEA and SSA) in JJA.

•  The main difference in the results is that there are substantially more instances for the SRES cases where there is disagree-
ment on the magnitude of the relative regional warming. This difference is mainly evident in tropical and Southern Hemisphere
regions.

•  The precipitation results from SRES are also broadly similar to the corresponding IS92a results. There are many regions where
the direction of precipitation change (although not necessarily the magnitude of this change) is consistent across all four cases.
In DJF this is true for increase in northern mid- to high latitude regions, Antarctica and tropical Africa (ALA, GRL, WNA,
ENA, NEU, NAS, TIB, CAS, WAF, EAF and ANT) and decrease in Central America (CAM). In JJA it is true for increase in
high latitude regions (ALA, GRL, NAS and ANT) and for decrease in southern and northern Australia (SAU and NAU). Little
change in Southeast Asia in DJF and little change or increase over South Asia in JJA are also consistent results.

•  Although there are no cases where the SRES and IS92a results indicate precipitation changes of opposite direction, there are
some notable differences. In the Sahara and in East Asia (SAH and EAS) in JJA, the results for both SRES scenarios show
consistent increase whereas this was not true in either of the IS92a cases. On the other hand, in central North America and
northern Australia (CNA and NAU) in DJF, and in East Africa (EAF) in JJA, the results for both SRES scenarios show model
disagreement whereas the IS92a scenarios showed a consistent direction of change (increase in CNA, and decrease in EAF
and NAU). It is also notable that the consistent decrease in JJA precipitation over the Mediterranean basin (MED) seen for
both IS92a cases is present for SRES only for the A2 scenario (for which the decrease is large).

Box 10.1, Figure 2: Analysis of inter-model consistency in regional precipitation change. Regions are classified as showing either
agreement on increase with an average change of greater than 20% (‘Large increase’), agreement on increase with an average change
between 5 and 20% (‘Small increase’), agreement on a change between −5 and +5% or agreement with an average change between −5 and
5% (‘No change’), agreement on decrease with an average change between −5 and −20% (‘Small decrease’), agreement on decrease with an
average change of less than −20% (‘Large decrease’), or disagreement (‘Inconsistent sign’). A consistent result from at least seven of the
nine models is deemed necessary for agreement.

Uncertainty
The  above  comparisons  concern  the  quantification  of  two  different  sources  of  uncertainty  represented  in  the  cascade  of
uncertainty described in Chapter 13, Section 13.5.1 (Figure 13.2). These include uncertainties in future emissions (IS92a GG
and GS; SRES A2 and B2), and uncertainties in modelling the response of the climate system to a given forcing (samples of up
to nine AOGCMs). Agreement across the different scenarios and climate models suggests, relatively speaking, less uncertainty
about the nature of regional climate change than where there is disagreement. For example, the agreement for northern latitude
winter precipitation extends across all emission scenarios and all models, whereas there is considerable disagreement (greater
uncertainty) for tropical areas in JJA. Note that these measures of uncertainty are qualitative and applied on a relatively coarse
spatial scale. It should also be noted that the range of uncertainty covered by the four emissions scenarios does not encompass
the entire envelope of uncertainty of emissions (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2.4, and Chapter 13, Section 13.5.1). The range of
models (representing the uncertainties in modelling the response to a given forcing) is somewhat more complete than in earlier
analyses, but also limited.

strong  tendency  for  precipitation  to  increase, particularly  in  the
north-west of the continent. This tendency was replaced in the first
coupled  AOGCMs  by  one  of  little  change  or  precipitation
decrease, which  has  remained  when  the  most  recent  coupled
models are considered. Whetton et al. (1996a) partly attributed the
contrast in the regional precipitation response of the two types of
experiments to contrasts in their hemispheric patterns of warming. 
Lal  et  al. (1998b)  surveyed  the  results  for  the  Indian
subcontinent of seventeen climate change experiments including
both  equilibrium  2⫻CO2 and  transient  AOGCM  simulations
with  and  without  sulphate  aerosol  forcing.  In  the  simulations
forced only by GHG increases, most models show wet season
(JJA)  rainfall  increases  over  the  region  of  less  than  5%  per
degree  of  global  warming.  A  minority  of  experiments  show
rainfall decreases. The experiments which included scenarios of
increasing  sulphate  forcing  all  showed  reduced  rainfall
increases, or  stronger  rainfall  decreases, than  their  correspon-
ding GHG-only experiments. 

For the central plains of North America, IPCC (1990) noted
a good deal of similarity in the response of equilibrium 2⫻CO2
experiments, with  precipitation  decreases  prevailing  in  the
summer  and  increases  in  the  winter  of  less  than  10%.  In  the
second group of experiments (nine transient runs with AOGCMs)
a  wider  range  of  responses  was  found  (in  the  SAR).  In  winter,
changes in precipitation ranged from about −12 to +20% for the
time of CO2 doubling, and most of the models (six out of nine)
exhibited increases. In summer, the range of change was narrower,
within ±10%, but there was no clear majority response towards
increases or decreases. Doherty and Mearns (1999) found that the
CGCM1  and  HadCM2  models  simulated  opposite  changes  in
precipitation in both seasons over North America. While overall
there  is  a  tendency  for  more  decreases  to  be  simulated  in  the
summer and more increases in the winter, there does not seem to
be  a  reduction  in  the  uncertainty  for  this  region  through  the
progression of climate models.

Many  studies  have  considered  GCM-simulated  patterns  of
climate change in the European region (e.g., Barrow et al., 1996;
Hulme and Brown, 1998; Osborn and Hulme, 1998; Räisänen,
1998; Benestad et al. 1999; Osborn et al., 1999). Hulme et al.
(2000) provide an overview of simulated changes in the region by
considering  the  results  of  twenty-three  climate  change  simula-
tions (forced by GHG change only) produced between the years
1983  and  1998  and  including  mixed-layer  1⫻ and  2⫻CO2
equilibrium experiments as well as transient experiments. Figure
10.7 shows their results for simulated change in annual precipita-
tion, averaged by latitude and normalised to percentage change
per degree of global warming. It may be seen that the consensus
amongst current models for drying in southern Europe and wetter
conditions  in  northern  Europe  represents  a  continuation  of  a
pattern established amongst the earlier simulations. The effect of
model development has primarily been to intensify this pattern of
response. 

Variations across simulations in the regional enhanced GHG
results of AOGCMs, which are particularly evident for precipita-
tion, represent a major uncertainty in any assessment of regional
climate  change.  Such  variation  may  arise  due  to  differences  in
forcing, systematic  model-to-model  differences  in  the  regional

response to a given forcing or differences due to natural decadal
to  inter-decadal  scale  variability  in  the  models.  Giorgi  and
Francisco  (2000a,b)  analysed  AOGCM  simulations  including
different models, forcing scenarios and ensembles of simulations,
and  found  that  the  greatest  source  of  uncertainty  in  regional
climate  change  simulation  was  due  to  inter-model  differences,
with  intra-ensemble  and  inter-scenario  differences  being  less
important  (see  Figures  10.3  and  10.5).  However, it  should  be
noted that Giorgi and Francisco (2000a,b) used long (thirty year)
means  and  large  (sub-continental  scale)  regions  and  that  the
uncertainty due to simulated natural variability would be larger
when shorter averaging periods, or smaller regions, are used. The
results  of  Hulme  et  al. (1999)  also  suggest  that  low-frequency
natural climatic variability is important at the sub-regional scale
in Europe and can mask the enhanced GHG signal. 

Regional  changes  in  the  mean  pattern  of  atmospheric
circulation have been noted in various studies, although typically
the changes are not marked (e.g., Huth, 1997; Schubert, 1998).
Indeed, the  work  of  Conway  (1998)  and  Wilby  et  al. (1998b)
suggests that the contribution of changes in synoptic circulation
to regional climate change may be relatively small compared to
that of sub-synoptic processes. 

10.3.2.2 Climate variability and extreme events 
Gregory and Mitchell (1995) identified in an equilibrium 2⫻CO2
simulation  with  the  Hadley  Centre  model  a  tendency  for  daily
temperature  variability  over  Europe  to  increase  in  JJA  and  to
decrease in DJF. Subsequent work on temperature variability at
daily to monthly and seasonal time-scales has tended to confirm
this  pattern, as  found  by  Buishand  and  Beersma  (1996)  over
Europe, Beersma  and  Buishand  (1999)  over  southern  Europe,
northern  Europe  and  central  North  America  and  Boer  et  al.
(2000b) throughout the northern mid-latitudes. This tendency can
also be seen in the results of Giorgi and Francisco (2000a) for a
set of transient HadCM2 simulations over different regions of the
globe.

Daily  high  temperature  extremes  are  likely  to  increase  in
frequency as a function of the increase in mean temperature, but
this  increase  is  modified  by  changes  in  daily  variability  of
temperature. There is a corresponding decrease in the frequency
of daily low temperature extremes. Kharin and Zwiers (2000) and
Zwiers and Kharin (1997) found that in all regions of the globe
the  CGCM1  model  simulated  substantial  increases  in  the
magnitude  of  extreme  daily  maximum  and  minimum  tempera-
tures, with  an  average  frequency  of  occurrence  of  once  per
twenty  years.  Delworth  et  al. (1999)  considered  simulated
changes of a ‘heat index’ (a measure which combines the effect
temperature  and  moisture)  in  the  GFDL  R15a  model.  Their
results indicated that seasonally warm and humid areas such as
the  south-eastern  United  States, India, Southeast  Asia  and
northern  Australia  can  experience  increases  in  the  heat  index
substantially greater than that expected due to warming alone.

There  is  a  strong  correlation  between  precipitation  inter-
annual  variability  and  mean  precipitation.  Increases  in  mean
precipitation  are  likely  to  be  associated  with  increases  in
variability, and precipitation variability is likely to decrease in areas
of  reduced  mean  precipitation.  In  general, where  simulated

Regional Climate Information – Evaluation and Projections

changes in regional precipitation variability have been examined,
increases  are  more  commonly  noted.  Giorgi  and  Francisco
(2000a) found a tendency for regional interannual variability of
seasonal mean precipitation to increase in HadCM2 simulations in
many  of  the  regions  they  considered.  Increases  in  interannual
variability also predominated in the CGCM1 simulation (Boer et
al., 2000b) although there were areas of decrease, particularly in
areas  where  mean  rainfall  decreased.  Beersma  and  Buishand
(1999) mostly found increases in monthly precipitation variance
over  southern  Europe, northern  Europe  and  central  North
America.  A  number  of  studies  have  reported  a  tendency  for
interannual rainfall variability to increase over South Asia (SAR;
Lal et al., 2000). McGuffie et al. (1999) identified a tendency for
increased daily rainfall variability in two models over the Sahel,
North  America, South  Asia, southern  Europe  and  Australia.  It
should  also  be  noted  that  in  many  regions  interannual  climatic
variability is strongly related to ENSO, and thus will be affected
by changes in ENSO behaviour (see Chapter 9).

The  tendency  for  increased  rainfall  variability  in  enhanced
GHG simulations is reflected in a tendency for increases in the
intensity  and  frequency  of  extreme  heavy  rainfall  events.  Such
increases have been documented in regionally focused studies for
Europe, North America, South Asia, the Sahel, southern Africa,
Australia and the South Pacific (Hennessy et al., 1997; Bhaskaran
and Mitchell, 1998; McGuffie et al 1999;  Jones, R.N. et al., 2000)
as well as in the global studies of Kharin and Zwiers (2000) and
Zwiers and Kharin (1998). For example, Hennessy et al. (1997)
found  that  under  2⫻CO2 conditions  the  one-year  return  period
events  in  Europe, Australia, India  and  the  USA  increased  in
intensity by 10 to 25% in two models.

Changes  in  the  occurrence  of  dry  spells  or  droughts  have
been assessed for some regions using recent model results. Joubert
et al. (1996) examined drought occurrence over southern Africa in
an equilibrium 2⫻CO2 CSIRO simulation and noted areas of both
substantial increase and decrease. Gregory et al. (1997) looked at
drought occurrence over Europe and North America in a transient
simulation  using  both  rainfall-based  and  soil  moisture-based
measures of drought. In all cases, marked increases were obtained.
This  was  attributed  primarily  to  a  reduction  in  the  number  of
rainfall  events  rather  than  a  reduction  in  mean  rainfall.  Marked
increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  drought  were  found
also by Kothavala (1997) over Australia using the Palmer drought
severity index.

Fewer  studies  have  considered  changes  in  variability  and
extremes of synoptic circulation under enhanced GHG conditions.
Huth (1997) noted little change in synoptic circulation variability
under  equilibrium  2⫻CO2 conditions  over  North  America  and
Europe. Katzfey and McInnes (1996) found that the intense cut-
off lows off the Australian east coast became less common under
equilibrium  2⫻CO2 conditions  in  the  CSIRO  model, although
they had limited confidence in this result.

10.3.3 Summary and Recommendations

Analysis  of  transient  simulations  with AOGCMs  indicates  that
average  climatic  features  are  generally  well  simulated  at  the
planetary and continental scale. At the regional scale, area-average

biases in the simulation of present day climate are highly variable
from  region  to  region  and  across  models.  Seasonal  temperature
biases are typically within the range of ±4°C but exceed ±5°C in
some regions, particularly in DJF. Precipitation biases are mostly
between −40 and +80%, but exceed 100% in some regions. These
regional  biases  are, in  general  terms, smaller  than  those  of  a
similar analysis presented in the SAR. When it has been assessed,
many  aspects  of  model  variability  have  compared  well  against
observations, although  significant  model-dependent  biases  have
been  noted.  Model  performance  was  poorer  at  the  finer  scales,
particularly  in  areas  of  strong  topographical  variation.  This
highlights the need for finer resolution regionalisation techniques.
Simulated  changes  in  mean  climatic  conditions  for  the  last
decades  of  the  21st  century  (compared  to  present  day  climate)
vary  substantially  among  models  and  among  regions.  All  land
regions undergo warming in all seasons, with the warming being
generally more pronounced over cold climate regions and seasons.
Average precipitation increases over most regions, especially in
the cold season, due to an intensified hydrological cycle. However,
some exceptions occur in which most models concur in simulating
decreases in precipitation. The magnitude of regional precipitation
change varies considerably among models with the typical range
being around 0 to 50%, where the direction of change is strongly
indicated, and around −30 to +30% where it is not. There is strong
tendency for models to simulate regional increases in precipitation
variability with associated increases in the frequency of extreme
rainfall  events.  Increased  interannual  precipitation  variability  is
also  commonly  simulated  and, in  some  regions, increases  in
drought or dry-spell occurrence have been noted. Daily to inter-
annual  variability  of  temperature  is  simulated  to  decrease  in
winter  and  increase  in  summer  in  mid-latitude  Northern
Hemisphere land areas.

10.4 GCMs with Variable and Increased Horizontal 

Resolution

This section deals with the relatively new idea of deriving regional
climate  information  from  AGCMs  with  variable  and  increased
horizontal  resolution.  Although  the  basic  methodology  is
suggested in the work of Bengtsson et al. (1995), where a high
resolution GCM was used to simulate changes in tropical cyclones
in  a  warmer  climate, it  is  only  in  the  last  few  years  that  such
models have been used more widely to predict regional aspects of
climate change. Even so, only a limited number of experiments
have  been  conducted  to  date  (see  Table  10.1)  and  hence  what
follows is not a definitive evaluation of the technique but an initial
exploration of its potential. 

10.4.1 Simulations of Current Climate

Analysis  of  current  climate  simulations  has  considered  both
deviations  from  the  observed  climate  and  effects  of  changes  in
resolution on the model’s climatology. Most studies have consid-
ered just the mean climate and some measures of variability, either
globally or for a particular region of interest. The only extreme
behaviour  studied  in  any  detail  was  the  simulation  of  tropical
cyclones. Even for mean climate, no comprehensive assessment

of the surface climatology of variable or high resolution models
has been attempted. Europe has been the most common area of
study to date, although southern Asia and the polar regions have
also received attention

10.4.1.1 Mean climate
The  mean  circulation  is  generally  well  simulated  by  AGCMs,
though  relatively  large  regional-scale  biases  can  still  be  present.
Many features of the large-scale climate of AGCMs are retained at
higher  resolution  (Dèquè  and  Piedelievre, 1995;  Stendel  and
Roeckner, 1998; May, 1999; Stratton, 1999a). A common change
is a poleward shift of the extra-tropical storm track regions. It has
been  suggested  that  this  is  linked  to  a  general  deepening  of
cyclones, noted  as  a  common  feature  in  high-resolution
atmospheric models (Machenhauer et al., 1996; Stratton 1999a).
More intense activity is also seen at higher resolution in the tropics.
For  example, a  stronger  Hadley  circulation  was  observed  in
ECHAM4 and HadAM3a that worsened agreement with observa-
tions (Stendel and Roeckner, 1998; Stratton, 1999b).

The repositioning of the storm tracks generally improves the
simulations in the Northern Hemisphere, as it reduces a positive
polar  surface  pressure  bias  which  is  present  in  the  models  at
standard resolution. In the case of HadAM3a, this leads to substan-
tial improvements in Northern Hemisphere low level flow in winter
(Figure  10.8).  In  the  Southern  Hemisphere, the  impact  on  the
circumpolar flow is not consistently positive across models (Figure
10.8; Krinner et al., 1997). In ECHAM4 and HadAM3a, increased
resolution has little impact on the negative surface pressure bias
over the tropics but improves the low-level South Asian monsoon
flow (Lal et al., 1997; Stratton, 1999b).

The existence of these common responses to increased resolu-
tion suggests that they result from improved representation of the
resolved variables. In contrast, an increase in the intensity of sub-
tropical anticyclones observed in ECHAM4 results from a tropos-
pheric warming promoted by excessive cirrus clouds attributed to
a scale-dependent response in the relevant parametrization (Stendel
and Roeckner, 1998).

The  aim  of  increasing  resolution  in AGCMs  is  generally  to
improve the simulation of surface climatology compared to coarser
resolution models (Cubash et al., 1995). Early experience shows a
much  more  mixed  response.  ECHAM3  at  T42  improved  the
seasonal cycle of surface temperature in seven regions, compared

to the driving AOGCM, but overall surface temperature was too
high  (by  2  to  5ºC).  Increasing  the  resolution  to  T106  did  not
improve winter temperatures and, in summer, the spatial patterns
were better but the regional biases worse (Cubasch et al., 1996).
For  precipitation, spatial  patterns  were  improved  in  summer  but
degraded  in  winter. The  summer  warming  was  due  to  excessive
insolation from reduced cloud cover and overly transparent clear
skies (Wild et al., 1995). Improved physics in ECHAM4 reduced
some of the radiation errors but the precipitation and temperature
biases remained (Wild et al, 1996; Stendel and Roeckner, 1998). In
simulations  of  European  climate  with  ARPEGE  (Dèquè  and
Piedelievre, 1995)  and  HadAM2b/3a  (Jones, 1999;  Stratton,
1999a), improved flow at higher resolution generally led to better
surface  temperatures  and  precipitation.  However, over  south-
eastern Europe, precipitation biases increased in both models, as
did the warm temperature bias in HadAM3a. 

The increased summer temperatures in Europe in HadAM3a
were  caused  by  reduced  cloud  cover  at  higher  resolution  (Jones
1999) and warming and drying, in summer, was seen over all extra-
tropical continents (Stratton, 1999b). This clearly demonstrates a
potential drawback of increasing the resolution of a model without
comprehensively  retuning  the  physics.  Krinner  et  al. (1997)
showed  that, to  obtain  a  reasonable  simulation  of  the  surface
climatology  of  the  Antarctic  with  the  LMD  variable  resolution
AGCM, many modifications to the model physics were required.
The model was then able to simulate surface temperatures to within
2 to 4ºC of observations and to provide a good simulation of the ice
mass balance (snow accumulation), with both aspects being better
than at standard resolution.

10.4.1.2 Climate variability and extreme events
Enhanced resolution improves many aspects of the AGCMs’ intra-
seasonal variability of circulation at low and intermediate frequen-
cies (Stendel and Roeckner, 1998). However, in some cases values
underestimated  at  standard  resolution  are  overestimated  at
enhanced  resolution  (Dèquè  and  Piedelievre, 1995;  Stratton,
1999a,b).  Martin  (1999)  found  little  sensitivity  to  resolution  in
either the interannual or intra-seasonal variability of circulation and
precipitation of the South Asian monsoon in HadAM3a. Extreme
events  have  not  been  studied, with  the  exception  of  tropical
cyclones.  This  subject  cuts  across  various  sections  and  chapters
and thus is dealt with in Box 10.2.

Box 10.2: Tropical cyclones in current and future climates

Simulating a climatology of tropical cyclones
Tropical  cyclones  can  have  devastating  human  and  economic  impacts  (e.g., Pielke  and  Landsea, 1998)  and  therefore  accurate
estimates of future changes in their frequency, intensity and location would be of great value. However, because of their relatively
small extent (in global modelling terms) and intense nature, detailed simulation of tropical cyclones for this purpose is difficult.
Atmospheric  GCMs  can  simulate  tropical  cyclone-like  disturbances  which  increase  in  realism  at  higher  resolution  though  the
intense central core is not resolved (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 1995; McDonald, 1999). Further increases of resolution, by the use of
RCMs, provide greater realism (e.g., Walsh and Watterson, 1997) with a very high resolution regional hurricane prediction model
giving a reasonable simulation of the magnitude and location of maximum surface wind intensities for the north-west Pacific basin
(Knutson et al., 1998). GCMs generally provide realistic simulation of the location and frequency of tropical cyclones (e.g., Tsutsui
and Kasahara, 1996; Yoshimura et al., 1999). See also Chapter 8 for more details on tropical cyclones in GCMs.

Tropical cyclones in a warmer climate
Much effort has gone into obtaining and analysing good statistics on tropical cyclones in the recent past. The main conclusion is
that there is large decadal variability in the frequency and no significant trend during the last century. One study looking at the
century  time-scale  has  shown  an  increase  in  the  frequency  of  North Atlantic  cyclones  from  1851  to  1890  and  1951  to  1990
(Fernandez-Partagas and Diaz, 1996). See Chapter 2 for more details on observed tropical cyclones.

Most assessments of changes in tropical cyclone behaviour in a future climate have been derived from GCM or RCM studies
of the climate response to anthropogenically-derived atmospheric forcings (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 1996, 1997; Walsh and Katzfey,
2000). Recently, more focused approaches have been used: nesting a hurricane prediction model in a GCM climate change simula-
tion (Knutson et al., 1998); inserting idealised tropical cyclones into an RCM climate change simulation (Walsh and Ryan, 2000).
In an early use of a high-resolution AGCM, a T106 ECHAM3 experiment simulated a decrease in tropical cyclones in the
Northern Hemisphere and a reduction of 50% in the Southern Hemisphere (Bengtsson et al., 1996, 1997). However, the different
hemispheric  responses  raised  questions  about  the  model’s  ability  to  properly  represent  tropical  cyclones  and  methodological
concerns about the experimental design were raised (Landsea, 1997). In a similar experiment, the JMA model also simulated
fewer tropical cyclone-like vortices in both hemispheres (Yoshimura et al., 1999). Other GCM studies have shown consistent
basin-dependent  changes  in  tropical  cyclone  formation  under  2⫻CO2 conditions  (Royer  et  al., 1998;  Tsutsui  et  al., 1999).
Frequencies increased in the north-west Pacific, decreased in the North Atlantic, and changed little in the south-west Pacific. A
high  resolution  HadAM3a  simulation  reproduced  the  latter  changes, giving  changes  in  timing  in  the  north-west  Pacific  and
increases in frequency in the north-east Pacific and the north Indian basin (McDonald, 1999). Some GCM studies show increases
in tropical storm intensity in a warmer climate (Krishnamurti et al., 1998) though these results can probably not be extrapolated
to  tropical  cyclones  as  the  horizontal  resolution  of  these  models  is  insufficient  to  resolve  the  cyclone  eye.  The  likely  mean
response of tropical Pacific sea surface warming having an El Niño-like structure suggests that the pattern of tropical cyclone
frequency may become more like that observed in El Niño years (see Chapter 9).

An indication of the likely changes in maximum intensity of cyclones will be better provided by models able to simulate
realistic tropical cyclone intensities. A sample of GCM-generated tropical cyclone cases nested in a hurricane prediction model
gave increases in maximum intensity (of wind speed) of 5 to 11% in strong cyclones over the north-west Pacific for a 2.2oC SST
warming (Knutson and Tuleya, 1999). The RCM study of idealised tropical cyclones (in the South Pacific) showed a small, but
not statistically significant, increase in maximum intensity (Walsh and Ryan, 2000). These results are supported by the theory of
the maximum potential intensity (MPI) of hurricanes (Emanuel, 1987). A calculation using the MPI framework of Holland (1997)
suggested increases of 10 to 20% for a 2⫻CO2 climate (Henderson-Sellers et al., 1998). This study also acknowledges physical
omissions that would reduce this estimate though Emanuel (2000) suggests there is a linear relationship betweeen MPI and the
wind speed of real events. Published modelling studies to date neglect the possible feedback of sea surface cooling induced by
the  cyclone.  However, a  recently  submitted  study  using  a  hurricane  model  with  ocean  coupling  indicates  that  the  increased
maximum intensity by CO2 warming would still occur even when the sea surface cooling feedback is included (Knutson et al.,
2000).

The extreme precipitation associated with tropical cyclones can also be very damaging. The very high resolution studies
discussed  above  suggest  that  increases  in  the  intensity  of  tropical  cyclones  will  be  accompanied  by  increases  in  mean  and
maximum precipitation rates. In the cases studied, precipitation in the vicinity of the storm centre increased by 20% whereas peak
rates increased by 30%. Part of these increases may be due to the increased moisture-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere
but nevertheless point to substantially increasing destructive capacity of tropical cyclones in a warmer climate.

In conclusion, there is some evidence that regional frequencies of tropical cyclones may change but none that their locations will
change. There is also evidence that the peak intensity may increase by 5% to 10% and precipitation rates may increase by 20% to
30%. There is a need for much more work in this area to provide more robust results.

10.4.2 Simulations of Climate Change

10.4.2.1 Mean climate
Climate  change  simulations  using  ECHAM3  at  T42  and  T106
resolutions  predicted  substantially  different  responses  for
southern  Europe  (Cubash  et  al., 1996).  For  example, surface
temperature  response  of  less  than  +2ºC  in  summer  at  T42
increased by over 4ºC for much of the region at T106 and winter
precipitation increased more at T106 than at T42. An important
factor  in  generating  the  different  responses  was  the  substantial
difference in the control simulations. Wild et al. (1997) showed a
large  positive  summer  surface  temperature  bias  in  the  T106
control  derived  from  a  positive  feedback  between  excessive
surface  insolation  and  summer  dryness.  This  mechanism
provided a large increase in the insolation, and thus the surface
temperature, in  the  anomaly  experiment.  As  this  process  was
handled poorly in the control simulation, little confidence can be
placed in the warming amplification simulated at T106.

A variable grid AGCM climate change experiment using the
ARPEGE  model  and  sea  surface  forcing  from  HadCM2
predicted  moderate  warmings  over  Europe, 1.5ºC  (northern)  to
2.5ºC (southern) in winter and 1ºC to 3.5ºC in summer (Dèquè et
al., 1998). In contrast, HadCM2 predicted greater warming and a
larger north-south gradient in winter (Figure 10.9). These differ-
ences result mainly from the ARPEGE large-scale flow being too
zonal and too strong over mainland Europe, which enhances the
moderating  influence  of  the  SSTs.  The  precipitation  responses
are  more  similar, especially  in  summer, when  both  models
predict a decrease over most of Europe, maximum –30% in the
south.  Differences  in  the  control  simulations  suggest  that  little
confidence should be placed in this result.

In a similar experiment, HadAM3a at 1.25°⫻0.83° resolu-
tion  used  observed  sea  surface  forcing  and  anomalies  from  a
HadCM3 GHG simulation and produced a response at the largest
scales in the annual mean similar to the AOGCM (Johns, 1999).
However, regionally  or  seasonally, many  differences  were
evident in the two models, notably in land sea contrasts, monsoon
precipitation and some circulation features. Over Europe, large-
scale  responses  in  surface  temperature  and  precipitation  were
similar  except  for  a  larger  winter  surface  warming  in  northern
Europe in HadCM3. This was due to a greater melting back of
Arctic sea ice which was too extensive in the HadCM3 control
(Jones, 1999). In a 30-year ECHAM4 T106 experiment driven by
ECHAM4/OPYC  simulations  for  1970  to  1999  and  2060  to
2089, the simulations of future climate were more similar to each
other  than  those  for  the  present  day  (May, 1999). This  implies
that the differences in the control simulations would determine a
proportion of the difference in the responses. In these cases better
control simulations at high resolution increase the confidence in
their responses.

10.4.2.2 Climate variability and extreme events
Due to the limited number and length of simulations and a lack
of  comprehensive  analyses, this  subject  has  been  almost
completely  ignored.  The  only  response  in  variability  or
extremes  that  has  received  any  attention  is  that  of  tropical
cyclones (Box 10.2).

10.4.3 Summary and Recommendations 

Since the SAR, several variable and high-resolution GCMs have
been  used  to  provide  high-resolution  simulations  of  climate
change. Clearly the technique is still in its infancy with only a few
modelling studies carried out and for only a limited number of
regions. Also, there is little in-depth analysis of the performance
of the models and only preliminary conclusions can be drawn.

Many aspects of the models’ dynamics and large-scale flow
are improved at higher resolution, though this is not uniformly so
geographically or across models. Some models also demonstrate
improvements in their surface climatologies at higher resolution.
However, substantial underlying errors are often still present in
high-resolution  versions  of  current  AGCMs.  In  addition, the
direct use of high-resolution versions of current AGCMs, without
some allowance of the dependence of models physical parame-
trizations  on  resolution, leads  to  some  deterioration  in  the
performance of the models.

Regional  responses  currently  appear  more  sensitive  to  the
AGCM than the SST forcing used. This result is partially due to
some  of  the  model  responses  being  dependent  on  their  control
simulations and systematic errors within them. These factors and
the  small  number  of  studies  carried  out  imply  that  little
confidence  can  be  attached  to  any  of  the  regional  projections
provided by high and variable resolution AGCM simulations. The
improvements  seen  with  this  technique  are  encouraging, but
more effort should be put in analysing, and possibly improving
the  performance  of  current  models  at  high  resolution.  This  is
particularly important in view of the fact that future AOGCMs
will likely use models approaching the resolution considered here
in the next 5 to 10 years.

10.5 Regional Climate Models

Since the SAR, much insight has been provided into fundamental
issues concerning the nested regional modelling technique.

Multi-year  to  multi-decadal  simulations  must  be  used  for
climate change studies to provide meaningful climate statistics,
to  identify  significant  systematic  model  errors  and  climate
changes  relative  to  internal  model  and  observed  climate
variability, and  to  allow  the  atmospheric  model  to  equilibrate
with  the  land  surface  conditions  (e.g., Jones  et  al., 1997;
Machenhauer  et  al., 1998;  Christensen  1999;  McGregor  et  al.,
1999; Kato et al., 2001).

The  choice  of  an  appropriate  domain  is  not  trivial.  The
influence  of  the  boundary  forcing  can  reduce  as  region  size
increases (Jones et al., 1995; Jacob and Podzun, 1997) and may
be dominated by the internal model physics for certain variables
and  seasons  (Noguer  et  al., 1998).  This  can  lead  to  the  RCM
solution significantly departing from the driving data, which can
make the interpretation of down-scaled regional climate changes
more  difficult  (Jones  et  al., 1997).  The  domain  size  has  to  be
large  enough  so  that  relevant  local  forcings  and  effects  of
enhanced  resolution  are  not  damped  or  contaminated  by  the
application of the boundary conditions (Warner et al., 1997). The
exact  location  of  the  lateral  boundaries  can  influence  the
sensitivity to internal parameters (Seth and Giorgi, 1998) or may

have  no  significant  impact  (Bhaskaran  et  al., 1996).  Finally,
location  of  boundaries  over  areas  with  significant  topography
may lead to inconsistencies and noise generation (e.g., Hong and
Juang, 1998).

Surface forcing due to land, ocean and sea ice greatly affects
regional  climate  simulation  (e.g., Giorgi  et  al., 1996;  Seth  and
Giorgi, 1998; Wei and Fu, 1998; Christensen, 1999; Pan et al.,
1999; Pielke et al., 1999; Rinke and Dethloff, 1999; Chase et al.,
2000;  Maslanik  et  al., 2000, Rummukainen  et  al., 2000).  In
particular, RCM  experiments  do  not  start  with  equilibrium
conditions  and  therefore  the  initialisation  of  surface  variables,
such as soil moisture and temperature, is important. For example,
to reach equilibrium it can require a few seasons for the rooting
zone (about 1 m depth) and years for the deep soils (Christensen,
1999).

The choice of RCM resolution can modulate the effects of
physical  forcings  and  parametrizations  (Giorgi  and  Marinucci,
1996a; Laprise et al., 1998). The description of the hydrologic
cycle  generally  improves  with  increasing  resolution  due  to  the
better  topographical  representation  (Christensen  et  al., 1998;
Leung  and  Ghan, 1998).  Resolving  more  of  the  spectrum  of
atmospheric motions at high resolution improves the representa-
tion  of  cyclonic  systems  and  vertical  velocities, but  can
sometimes  worsen  aspects  of  the  model  climatology
(Machenhauer et al., 1998; Kato et al., 1999). Different resolu-
tions  may  be  required  to  capture  relevant  forcings  in  different
sub-regions, which can be achieved via multiple one-way nesting
(Christensen  et  al., 1998;  McGregor  et  al., 1999), two-way
nesting (Liston et al., 1999) or smoothly varying horizontal grids
(Qian and Giorgi, 1999). Only limited studies of the effects of
changing  vertical  resolution  have  been  published  (Kato  et  al.,
1999).

RCM model physics configurations are derived either from a
pre-existing  (and  well  tested)  limited  area  model  system  with
modifications suitable for climate application (Pielke et al., 1992;
Giorgi et al., 1993b,c; Leung and Ghan, 1995, 1998; Copeland et
al., 1996;  Miller  and  Kim, 1997;  Liston  and  Pielke  2000;
Rummukainen  et  al., 2000)  or  are  implemented  directly  from  a
GCM (McGregor and Walsh, 1993; Jones et al., 1995; Christensen
et al., 1996; Laprise et al., 1998). In the first approach, each set of
parametrizations  is  developed  and  optimised  for  the  respective
model  resolutions.  However, this  makes  interpreting  differences
between nested model and driving GCM more difficult, as these
will not result only from changes in resolution. Also, the different
model  physics  schemes  may  result  in  inconsistencies  near  the
boundaries (Machenhauer et al., 1998; Rummukainen et al., 2000).
The  second  approach  maximises  compatibility  between  the
models. However, physics schemes developed for coarse resolution
GCMs may not be adequate for the high resolutions used in nested
regional models and may, at least, require recalibration (Giorgi and
Marinucci, 1996a;  Laprise  et  al., 1998;  see  also  Section  10.4).
Overall, both strategies have shown performance of similar quality
(e.g., IPCC, 1996), and either one may be preferable (Giorgi and
Mearns, 1999).  In  the  context  of  climate  change  simulations, if
there  is  no  resolution  dependence, the  second  approach  may  be
preferable  to  maximise  consistency  between  RCM  and  GCM
responses to the radiative forcing.

Ocean  RCMs  have  been  developed  during  the  last
decades  for  a  broad  variety  of  applications.  To  date, the
specific use of these models, in a context similar to the use of
nested atmospheric RCMs for climate change studies, is very
limited  (Kauker, 1998). Although  the  performance  of  ocean
RCMs  has  yet  to  be  assessed, it  is  known  that  a  very  high
resolution, few  tens  of  kilometres  or  less, is  needed  for
accurate ocean simulations.

The construction of coupled RCMs is a very recent develop-
ment.  They  comprise  atmospheric  RCMs  coupled  to  other
models of climate system components, such as lake, ocean/sea
ice, chemistry/aerosol, and  land  biosphere/hydrology  models
(Hostetler et al., 1994; Lynch et al., 1995, 1997a,b, 1998; Leung
et al., 1996; Bailey et al., 1997; Kim et al., 1998; Qian and Giorgi
1999; Small et al., 1999a,b; Bailey and Lynch, 2000a,b; Mabuchi
et al., 2000; Maslanik et al., 2000; Rummukainen et al., 2000;
Tsvetsinskaya et al., 2000; Weisse et al., 2000). This promises the
development of coupled “regional climate system models”. 

10.5.1 Simulations of Current Climate

Simulations  of  current  climate  conditions  serve  to  evaluate  the
performance  of  RCMs.  Since  the  SAR, a  vast  number  of  such
simulations have been conducted (McGregor, 1997; Appendices
10.1  to  10.3).  These  fall  into  two  categories, RCMs  driven  by
observed  (or  “perfect”)  boundary  conditions  and  RCMs  driven
by GCM boundary conditions. Observed boundary conditions are
derived  from  Numerical  Weather  Prediction  (NWP)  analyses
(e.g., European  Centre  for  Medium  Range  Weather  Forecast
(ECMWF) reanalysis, Gibson et al. 1997; or National Center for
Environmental  Prediction  (NCEP)  reanalysis, Kalnay  et  al.,
1996). Over most regions they give accurate representation of the
large-scale flow and tropospheric temperature structure (Gibson
et  al., 1997), although  errors  are  still  present  due  to  poor  data
coverage and to observational uncertainty. The analyses may be
used to drive RCM simulations for short periods, for comparison
with individual episodes, or over long periods to allow statistical
evaluation of the model climatology. Comparison with climatolo-
gies  is  the  only  available  evaluation  tool  for  RCMs  driven  by
GCM  fields, with  the  caveats  applied  to  GCM  validation
concerning the influence of sample size and decadal variability
(see Sections 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4). Despite these, relatively short
simulations (several years) can identify major systematic RCM
biases  if  they  yield  departures  from  observations  significantly
greater than the observed natural variability (Machenhauer et al.,
1996, 1998; Christensen et al., 1997; Jones et al., 1999).

Often  a  serious  problem  in  RCM  evaluation  is  the  lack  of
good  quality  high-resolution  observed  data.  In  many  regions,
observations  are  extremely  sparse  or  not  readily  available.  In
addition, only little work has been carried out on how to use point
measurements  to  evaluate  the  grid-box  mean  values  from  a
climate model, especially when using sparse station networks or
stations  in  complex  topographical  terrain  (e.g., Osborn  and
Hulme, 1997). Most of the observational data available at typical
RCM  resolution  (order  of  50  km)  is  for  precipitation  and  daily
minimum  and  maximum  temperature.  While  these  fields  have
been shown to be useful for evaluating model performance, they

610

Regional Climate Information – Evaluation and Projections

are also the end product of a series of complex processes, so that
the  evaluation  of  individual  model  dynamical  and  physical
processes  is  necessarily  limited.  Additional  fields  need  to  be
examined  in  model  evaluation  to  broaden  the  perspective  on
model performance and to help delineate sources of model error.
Examples are the surface energy and water fluxes.

Despite these problems, the situation is steadily improving in
terms  of  grid-cell  climatologies  (Daly  et  al., 1994;  New  et  al.,
1999, 2000; Widman and Bretherton, 2000), with various groups
developing  high-resolution  regional  climatologies  (e.g.,
Christensen  et  al., 1998;  Frei  and  Schär, 1998).  In  addition,
regional  programs  such  as  the  Global  Energy  and Water  Cycle
Experiment  (GEWEX)  Continental-Scale  International  Program
(GCIP) have been designed with the purpose of developing sets of
observation databases at the regional scale for model evaluation
(GCIP, 1998).

10.5.1.1 Mean climate: Simulations using analyses of observations
Ideally, experiments  using  analyses  of  observations  to  drive  the
RCMs  should  precede  any  attempt  to  simulate  climate  change.
The model behaviour, with realistic forcing, should be as close as
possible to that of the real atmosphere and experiments driven by
analyses  of  observations  can  reveal  systematic  model  biases
primarily due to the internal model dynamics and physics.

A list of published RCM simulations driven by analyses of
observations  is  given  in Appendix  10.1.  Many  of  these  studies
present regional differences (or biases) of seasonally or monthly-
averaged surface air temperature and precipitation from observed
values. They indicate that current RCMs can reproduce average
observations  over  regions  of  size  105 to  106 km2 with  errors
generally below 2°C and within 5 to 50% of observed precipita-
tion, respectively (Giorgi and Shields, 1999; Small et al., 1999a,b;
van Lipzig, 1999; Pan et al., 2000). Uncertainties in the analysis
fields, used to drive the models, and, in the observed station data
sets, should be considered in the interpretation of these biases.

Various RCM intercomparison studies have been carried out
to identify different or common model strengths and weaknesses,
over Europe by Christensen et al. (1997), over the USA by Takle
et  al. (1999), and  over  East Asia  by  Leung  et  al. (1999a).  For
Europe a wide range of performance was reported, with the better
models  exhibiting  a  good  simulation  of  surface  air  temperature
(sub-regional monthly bias in the range ±2°C), except over south-
eastern Europe during summer. For the USA, a major finding was
that  the  model  ability  to  simulate  precipitation  episodes  varied
depending  on  the  scale  of  the  relevant  dynamical  forcing.
Organised  synoptic-scale  precipitation  systems  were  well
simulated  deterministically, while  episodes  of  mesoscale  and
convective  precipitation  were  represented  in  a  more  stochastic
sense, with less degree of agreement with the observed events and
among models. Over East Asia, a major factor in determining the
model  performance  was  found  to  be  the  simulation  of  cloud
radiative processes.

10.5.1.2 Mean climate: Simulations using GCM boundary

conditions

Since the SAR, evaluation of RCMs driven by GCM simulations
of current climate has gained much attention (Appendix 10.2), as

this  is  the  context  in  which  many  RCMs  are  used  (e.g., for
climate  change  experiments).  Errors  introduced  by  the  GCM
representation  of  large-scale  circulations  are  transmitted  to  the
RCM  as, for  example, clearly  shown  by  Noguer  et  al. (1998).
However, since the SAR, regional biases of seasonal surface air
temperature and precipitation have been reduced and are mostly
within 2°C, and 50 to 60% of observations (with exceptions in all
seasons), respectively (Giorgi and Marinucci, 1996b; Noguer et
al., 1998; Jones et al., 1999 for Europe; Giorgi et al., 1998 for the
continental USA; McGregor et al., 1998 for Southeast Asia; Kato
et al., 2001 for East Asia). The reduction of biases is due to both
better large-scale boundary condition fields and improved aspects
of internal physics and dynamics in the RCMs. 

The regionally averaged biases in the nested RCMs are not
necessarily smaller than those in the driving GCMs. However, all
the experiments mentioned above, along with those of Leung et
al. (1999a,b), Laprise et al. (1998), Christensen et al. (1998) and
Machenhauer et al. (1998) clearly show that the spatial patterns
produced  by  the  nested  RCMs  are  in  better  agreement  with
observations because of the better representation of high-resolu-
tion topographical forcings and improved land/sea contrasts. For
example, in  simulations  over  Europe  and  central  USA, Giorgi
and Marinucci (1996a) and Giorgi et al. (1998) find correlation
coefficients between simulated and observed seasonally averaged
precipitation in the range of +0.53 to +0.87 in a nested RCM and
–0.69 to +0.85 in the corresponding driving GCM. 

The  role  of  the  high-resolution  forcing  was  clearly
demonstrated in the study of Noguer et al. (1998), which showed
that the skill in simulating the mesoscale component of the climate
signal (Giorgi et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1995) was little sensitive
to  the  quality  of  the  driving  data  (Noguer  et  al., 1998).  On  the
other hand, interactions between the large-scale driving data and
high  resolution  RCM  forcings  can  have  negative  effects.  In
simulations over the European region of Machenauer et al. (1998),
the increased shelter due to the better-resolved mountains in the
RCMs  caused  an  intensification  of  the  GCM-simulated
excessively dry and warm summer conditions over south-eastern
Europe. 

Horizontal resolution is especially important for the simula-
tion of the hydrologic cycle. Christensen et al. (1998) showed that
only at a very high resolution do the mountain chains in Norway
and Sweden become sufficiently well resolved to yield a realistic
simulation of the surface hydrology (Figure 10.10). An alternative
strategy is to utilise a sub-grid scale scheme capable of resolving
complex topographical features (Leung et al., 1999a). 

10.5.1.3 Climate variability and extreme events
A number of studies have investigated the interannual variability
in  RCM  simulations  driven  by  analyses  of  observations  over
different regions (e.g., Lüthi et al., 1996 for Europe; Giorgi et al.,
1996 and Giorgi and Shields 1999 for the continental USA; Sun
et al., 1999 for East Africa; Small et al., 1999a for central Asia;
Rinke et al., 1999 for the Arctic; van Lipzig, 1999 for Antarctica).
These show that RCMs can reproduce well interannual anomalies
of  precipitation  and  surface  air  temperature, both  in  sign  and
magnitude, over sub-regions varying in size from a few hundred
kilometres to about 1,000 km (Figure 10.11).

Season

Figure 10.11: Examples of seasonal precipitation anomalies simulated with RCMs driven by analyses of observations over different regions. In all
cases the anomalies are calculated as the difference between the precipitation of an individual season and the average for the seasonal value for the
entire simulation. (a) (top) Northwestern USA (NW), and (bottom) Upper Mississippi Basin (UMB) for a three year simulation (1993 to 1996)
over the continental USA. The three pairs of observed (hollow bars) and simulated (solid bars) anomalies for each season are grouped in sequen-
tial order from 1993 to 1996. Units are percentage of the three-year seasonal average (from Giorgi and Shields, 1999, Figure 9). (b) Precipitation
anomalies for twelve short-rains periods over Tanzania for the October-December season: (top) model simulation, and (bottom) observations.
Units are mm. (From Sun et al., 1999).

At  the  intra-seasonal  scale, the  timing  and  positioning  of
regional climatological features such as the East Asia rain belt
and  the  Baiu  front  can  be  reproduced  with  a  high  degree  of
realism with an RCM (Fu et al., 1998). A good simulation of the
intra-seasonal  evolution  of  precipitation  during  the  short  rain
season  of  East  Africa  has  also  been  documented  (Sun  et  al.,
1999). However, at shorter time-scales, Dai et al. (1999) found
that, despite a good simulation of average precipitation, signifi-
cant  problems  were  exhibited  by  an  RCM  simulation  of  the
observed diurnal cycle of precipitation over different regions of
the USA.

Only a few examples are available of analysis of variability
in RCMs driven by GCMs. At the intra-seasonal scale, Bhaskaran

et  al. (1998)  showed  that  the  leading  mode  of  sub-seasonal
variability of the South Asia monsoon, a 30 to 50 day oscillation
of circulation and precipitation anomalies, was more realistically
captured by an RCM than the driving GCM. Hassell and Jones
(1999) then showed that a nested RCM captured observed precip-
itation  anomalies  in  the  active  break  phases  of  the  South Asia
monsoon (5 to 10 periods of anomalous circulations and precipi-
tation) that were absent from the driving GCM (Figure 10.12).

At the daily time-scale, some studies have shown that nested
RCMs  tend  to  simulate  too  many  light  precipitation  events
compared with station data (Christensen et al. 1998; Kato et al.,
2001). However, RCMs produce more realistic statistics of heavy
precipitation events than the driving GCMs, sometimes capturing

extreme events entirely absent in the GCMs (Christensen et al.,
1998; Jones, 1999). Part of this is due to the inherent disaggrega-
tion of grid-box mean values resulting from the RCM’s higher
horizontal  resolution.  However, in  one  study, even  when
aggregated  to  the  GCM  grid  scale, the  RCM  was  closer  to
observations than the driving GCM (Durman et al., 2001). 

10.5.2 Simulations of Climate Change

Since the SAR, several multi-year RCM simulations of anthro-
pogenic climate change, either from equilibrium experiments or
for  time  slices  of  transient  simulations, have  become  available
(Appendix 10.3).

10.5.2.1 Mean climate
An important issue when analysing RCM simulations of climate
change  is  the  significance  of  the  modelled  responses.  To  date
RCM simulations have been mostly aimed at evaluating models
and  processes  rather  than  producing  projections  and, as  such,
they have been relatively short (10 years or less). At short time-
scales, natural  climate  variability  may  mask  all  but  the  largest
responses. For example, in an analysis of 10-year RCM simula-
tions  over  Europe, Machenhauer  et  al. (1998)  concluded  that
generally  only  the  full  area  averaged  seasonal  mean  surface
temperature responses were statistically significant, and in only a
few cases were sub-domain deviations from the mean response

significant. The changes in precipitation were highly variable in
space, and, in  each  season, they  were  only  significant  in  those
few  sub-areas  having  the  largest  changes.  Similar  results  were
documented by Pan et al. (2000) and Kato et al. (2001) for the
USA and East Asia, respectively. Hence, 30-year samples may be
required to confidently assess the mesoscale response of a RCM
(Jones et al., 1997). Partly to improve signal to noise definition,
a transient RCM simulation of 140 years duration was recently
conducted (Hennessy et al., 1998; McGregor et al., 1999).

Despite  the  limitations  in  simulation  length, most  RCM
experiments clearly indicate that, while the large-scale patterns of
surface  climate  change  in  the  nested  and  driving  models  are
similar, the  mesoscale  details  of  the  simulated  changes  can  be
quite  different.  For  example, significantly  different  patterns  of
temperature and rainfall changes were found in a regional climate
change simulation for Australia (Whetton et al., 2001). This was
most  clearly  seen  in  mountainous  areas  (Figure  10.13). Winter
rainfall in southern Victoria increased in the RCM simulation, but
decreased  in  the  driving  GCM.  High  resolution  topographical
modification of the regional precipitation change signal in nested
RCM simulations has been documented in other studies (Jones et
al., 1997; Giorgi et al., 1998; Machenhauer et al., 1998; Kato et
al., 2001).

The response in an RCM can also be modified by changes in
regional feedbacks. In a 20 year nested climate change experi-
ment for the Indian monsoon region, Hassell and Jones (1999)

showed that a maximum anomaly of 5°C seen in central northern
India  in  the  GCM  simulation  was  reduced  and  moved  to  the
north-west  in  the  nested  RCM, with  a  secondary  maximum
appearing to the south-east (Figure 10.14). The shift of the main
maximum  was  attributed  to  deficiencies  in  the  GCM  control
climate that promoted excessive drying of the soil in North-west
India.  The  secondary  maximum  was  attributed  to  a  complex
response involving the RCM’s better representation of the flow
patterns in southern India resulting from an improved representa-
tion  of  the  Western  Ghats  mountains.  In  this  instance, it  was
argued that the improved realism of the RCM’s control simula-
tion increases confidence in its response.

The high resolution representation of mountainous areas in
an RCM has made it possible to show that the simulated surface
air temperature change signal due to 2⫻CO2 concentration could
have  a  marked  elevation  dependency, resulting  in  more
pronounced  warming  at  high  elevations  than  low  elevations  as
shown  in  Figure  10.15  (Giorgi  et  al., 1997).  This  is  primarily
caused  by  a  depletion  of  the  snow  pack  in  enhanced  GHG
conditions and the associated snow albedo feedback mechanism,
and  it  is  consistent  with  observed  temperature  trends  for
anomalous  warm  winters  over  the  alpine  region.  A  similar
elevation  modulation  of  the  climate  change  signal  has  been
confirmed in later studies utilising both RCMs and GCMs (e.g.,
Leung and Ghan, 1999b; Fyfe and Flato, 1999).

The impact of land-use changes on regional climate has been
addressed in RCM simulations (e.g., Wei and Fu, 1998; Pan et al.,
1999; Pielke et al., 1999; Chase et al., 2000). Land-use changes
due to human activities could induce climate modifications, at the
regional  and  local  scale, of  magnitude  similar  to  the  observed
climatic  changes  during  the  last  century  (Pielke  et  al., 1999;
Chase et al., 2000). The issue of regional climate modification by

land-use change has been little explored within the context of the
global change debate and, because of its potential importance, is
in need of further examination.

10.5.2.2 Climate variability and extreme events
Changes  in  climate  variability  between  control  and  2⫻CO2
simulations with a nested RCM for the Great Plains of the USA
have been reported (Mearns, 1999; Mearns et al., 1999). There is
indication of significant decreases in daily temperature variability
in  winter  and  increases  in  temperature  variability  in  summer.
These changes are very similar to those of the driving GCM, while
changes  in  variability  of  precipitation  are  quite  different  in  the
nested and driving models, particularly in summer, with increases
being  more  pronounced  in  the  RCM.  Similar  results  have  been
documented over the Iberian Peninsula (Gallardo et al., 1999).

Different studies have analysed changes in the frequency of
heavy precipitation events in enhanced GHG climate conditions
over the European region (Schär et al., 1996; Frei et al., 1998;
Durman  et  al., 2001).  They  all  indicate  an  increase  of  up  to
several tens of percentage points in the frequency of occurrence
of  precipitation  events  exceeding  30  mm/day, with  these
increases being less than those simulated by the driving GCMs
(see also Jones et al., 1997). In a transient RCM simulation for
1961 to 2100 over south-eastern Australia, substantial increases
were found in the frequency of extreme daily rainfall and days
of extreme high maximum temperature (Hennessy et al., 1998),
In  this  long  simulation, changes  in  the  frequency  of  long-
duration  extreme  events  (such  as  droughts)  were  identified.
Finally, increases in the number of typhoons reaching mainland
China and in the number of heavy rain days were reported for
enhanced GHG conditions in RCM simulations over East Asia
(Gao et al., 2001).

10.5.3 Summary and Recommendations

Since the SAR, significant improvements have been achieved in
the  areas  of  development  and  understanding  of  the  nested
regional climate modelling technique. These include many new
RCM  systems, multiple  nesting, coupling  with  different
components of the climate system and research into the effects of
domain  size, resolution, boundary  forcing  and  internal  model
variability. As a result, a number of RCM systems are currently
available  with  the  capability  of  high-resolution, multi-decadal
simulations in a variety of regional settings. Nested RCMs have
shown marked improvements in their ability to reproduce present
day average climate, with some of this improvement due to better
quality driving fields provided by GCMs. Seasonal temperature
and  precipitation  biases  in  state-of-the-art  RCMs  are  generally
less than 1 to 2°C and a few percent to 50 to 60 % of observed
precipitation, respectively, over regions of size 105 to 106 km2.
However, it is imperative for the effective use of RCMs in climate
change work that the quality of GCM large-scale driving fields
continues  to  improve.  Research  aiming  at  reducing  systematic
errors  in  both  GCMs  and  RCMs  should  be  carried  out.  With
significantly  improved  model  systems  the  evidence, so  far,
indicates that improved regional climate change simulations can
be produced in the near future. 

The  analysis  of  RCM  simulations  has  extended  beyond
simple averages to include higher-order climate statistics, and has
indicated  that  RCMs  can  effectively  reproduce  interannual
variability when driven by good quality forcing fields. However,
more  anlysis  and  improvements  are  needed  of  the  model

performance in simulating climate variability at short time-scales
(daily to sub-daily).

A serious problem concerning RCM evaluation is a general
lack  of  good  quality  high-resolution  observed  data.  In  many
areas, observations  are  extremely  sparse  due  to  complex
geography  or  remoteness  of  settings.  In  addition, only  a  little
work has been carried out on how to use point measurements to
evaluate  the  grid-box  mean  values  from  a  climate  model,
especially  when  using  sparse  station  networks.  This  limits  the
ability  to  assess  model  skill  in  complex  terrain  and  remote
regions.  It  is  essential  for  the  advancement  of  regional  climate
understanding  and  modelling, that  more  research  aiming  at
improving the quality of data for model evaluation is performed. 
Overall, the evidence is strong that regional models consis-
tently improve the spatial detail of simulated climate compared
to GCMs because of their better representation of sub-GCM grid
scale  forcings, especially  in  regard  to  the  surface  hydrologic
budget.  This  is  not  necessarily  the  case  for  region-averaged
climate.  The  increased  resolution  of  RCMs  also  allows  the
simulation of a broader spectrum of weather events, in particular
concerning higher order climate statistics such as daily precipi-
tation  intensity  distributions.  Analysis  of  some  RCM  experi-
ments indicate that this is in the direction of increased agreement
with observations.

Several  RCM  studies  have  been  important  for
understanding  climate  change  processes, such  as  the  elevation
signature  of  the  climate  change  signal  or  the  effect  of  climate
change at the river catchment level. However, a consistent set of
RCM simulations of climate change for different regions which
can be used as climate change scenarios for impact work is still
not available. Most RCM climate change simulations have been
sensitivity and process studies aimed at specific goals. The need
is  there  to  co-ordinate  RCM  simulation  efforts  and  to  extend
studies  to  more  regions  so  that  ensemble  simulations  with
different  models  and  scenarios  can  be  developed  to  provide
useful information for impact assessments. This will need to be
achieved  under  the  auspices  of  international  or  large  national
programmes.  Within  this  context, an  important  issue  is  to
provide  RCM  simulations  of  increasing  length  to  minimise
limitations due to sampling problems.

10.6 Empirical/Statistical and Statistical/Dynamical Methods

10.6.1 Introduction

As  with  the  dynamical  downscaling  of  RCMs, the  methods
described  in  this  section  rely  on  the  concept  that  regional
climates  are  largely  a  function  of  the  large-scale  atmospheric
state.  In  empirical  downscaling  the  cross-scale  relationship  is
expressed as a stochastic and/or deterministic function between
a  set  of  large-scale  atmospheric  variables  (predictors)  and
local/regional  climate  variables  (predictands).  Predictor  and
predictand can be the same variables on different spatial scales
(e.g., Bürger, 1997;  Wilks, 1999b;  Widmann  and  Bretherton,
2000), but more commonly are different.

When  using  downscaling  for  assessing  regional  climate

change, three implicit assumptions are made:

Regional Climate Information – Evaluation and Projections

617

• The predictors are variables of relevance to the local climate
variable being derived, and are realistically modelled by the
GCM.  Tropospheric  quantities  such  as  temperature  or
geopotential  height  are  more  skilfully  represented  than
derived variables such as precipitation at the regional or grid
scale  (e.g., Osborn  and  Hulme, 1997;  Trigo  and  Palutikof,
1999).  Furthermore, there  is  no  theoretical  level  of  spatial
aggregation  at  which  GCMs  can  be  considered  skilful,
though  there  is  evidence  that  this  is  several  grid  lengths
(Widmann and Bretherton, 2000). 

• The  transfer  function  is  valid  under  altered  climatic
conditions (see Section 10.6.2.2). This cannot be proven in
advance, as it would require the observational record to span
all possible future realisations of the predictors. However, it
could  be  evaluated  with  nested AOGCM/RCM  simulations
of present and future climate, using the simulation of present
climate  to  determine  the  downscaling  function  and  testing
the function against the future time slice.

• The  predictors  fully  represent  the  climate  change  signal.
Most downscaling approaches to date have relied entirely on
circulation-based predictors and, therefore, can only capture
this  component  of  the  climate  change.  More  recently  other
important predictors, e.g., atmospheric humidity, have been
considered (e.g., Charles et al., 1999b; Hewitson, 1999). 

A diverse range of downscaling methods has been developed,
but, in principle, these models are based on three techniques:

• Weather generators, which are random number generators of
realistic  looking  sequences  of  local  climate  variables, and
may  be  conditioned  upon  the  large-scale  atmospheric  state
(Section 10.6.2.1);

• Transfer functions, where a direct quantitative relationship is
derived through, for example, regression (Section 10.6.2.2);

•  Weather  typing  schemes  based  on  the  more  traditional
synoptic climatology concept (including analogues and phase
space partitioning) and which relate a particular atmospheric
state to a set of local climate variables (Section 10.6.2.3).

Each  of  these  approaches  has  relative  strengths  and
weaknesses in representing the range of temporal variance of
the  local  climate  predictand.  Consequently, the  above
approaches are often used in conjunction with one another in
order  to  compensate  for  the  relative  deficiencies  in  one
method.

Most  downscaling  applications  have  dealt  with  tempera-
ture  and  precipitation.  However, a  diverse  array  of  studies
exists  in  which  other  variables  have  been  investigated.
Appendix  10.4  provides  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  past  studies
indicating  predictands, geographical  domain, and  technique
category. In light of the diversity in the literature, we concen-
trate  on  references  to  applications  since  1995  and  based  on
recent global climate change projections. 

10.6.2 Methodological Options

10.6.2.1 Weather generators
Weather generators are statistical models of observed sequences
of  weather  variables  (Wilks  and  Wilby, 1999).  Most  of  them
focus  on  the  daily  time-scale, as  required  by  many  impact
models, but sub-daily models are also available (e.g., Katz and
Parlange, 1995). Various  types  of  daily  weather  generators  are
available, based on the approach to modelling daily precipitation
occurrence, and usually these rely on stochastic processes. Two
of  the  more  common  are  the  Markov  chain  approach  (e.g.,
Richardson, 1981;  Hughes  et  al., 1993, Lettenmaier, 1995;
Hughes  et  al., 1999;  Bellone  et  al., 2000)  and  the  spell  length
approach  (Roldan  and  Woolhiser, 1982;  Racksko  et  al., 1991;
Wilks, 1999a). The adequacy of the stochastic models analysed
in  these  studies  varied  with  the  climate  characteristics  of  the
locations.  For  example, Wilks  (1999a)  found  the  first-order
Markov model to be adequate for the central and eastern USA,
but that spell length models performed better in the western USA.
An alternative approach would include stochastic mechanisms of
storm arrivals able to produce the clustering found in observed
sequences (e.g., Smith and Karr, 1985; Foufoula-Georgiou and
Lettenmeier, 1986; Gupta and Waymrie, 1991; Cowpertwait and
O’Connel, 1997; O’Connell, 1999).

In  addition  to  statistical  models  of  precipitation  frequency
and intensity, weather generators usually produce time-series of
other  variables, most  commonly  maximum  and  minimum
temperature, and solar radiation. Others also include additional
variables such as relative humidity and wind speed (Wallis and
Griffiths, 1997;  Parlange  and  Katz, 2000.)  The  most  common
means  of  including  variables  other  than  precipitation  is  to
condition them on the occurrence of precipitation (Richardson,
1981), most often via a multiple variable first-order autoregres-
sive  process  (Perica  and  Foufoula-Georgiou, 1996a,b;  Wilks,
1999b).  The  parameters  of  the  weather  generator  can  be
conditioned  upon  a  large-scale  state  (see  Katz  and  Parlange,
1996;  Wilby, 1998;  Charles  et  al., 1999a), or  relationships
between  large-scale  parameter  sets  and  local-scale  parameters
can be developed (Wilks, 1999b). 

10.6.2.2 Transfer functions
The  more  common  transfer  functions  are  derived  from  regres-
sion-like techniques or piecewise linear or non-linear interpola-
tions.  The  simplest  approach  is  to  build  multiple  regression
models  with  free  atmosphere  grid-cell  values  as  predictors  for
surface variables such as local temperatures (e.g., Sailor and Li,
1999).  Other  regression  models  have  used  fields  of  spatially
distributed  variables  (e.g., D.  Chen  et  al., 1999), principal
components  of  geopotential  height  fields  (e.g., Hewitson  and
Crane, 1992), Canonical  Correlation  Analysis  (CCA)  and  a
variant termed redundancy analysis (WASA, 1998) and Singular
Value Decomposition (e.g., von Storch and Zwiers, 1999). 

Most  applications  have  dealt  with  monthly  or  seasonal
rainfall  (e.g., Busuioc  and  von  Storch, 1996;  Dehn  and  Buma,
1999);  local  pressure  tendencies  (a  proxy  for  local  storminess;
Kaas et al., 1996); climate impact variables such as salinity and
oxygen (Heyen and Dippner, 1998; Zorita and Laine, 1999); sea

level  (e.g., Cui  et  al., 1996);  and  ecological  variables  such  as
abundance  of  species  (e.g., Kröncke  et  al., 1998).  In  addition
statistics of extreme events such as storm surge levels (e.g., von
Storch  and  Reichardt, 1997)  and  ocean  wave  heights  (WASA,
1998) have been simulated.

An alternative to linear regression is piecewise linear or non-
linear  interpolation  (Brandsma  and  Buishand, 1997;  Buishand
and  Brandsma, 1999), for  example, the  “kriging” tools  from
geostatistics (Biau et al., 1999). One application of this approach
is a non-linear model of snow cover duration in Austria derived
from  European  mean  temperature  and  altitude  (Hantel  et  al.,
1999).  An  alternative  approach  is  based  on  Artificial  Neural
Networks (ANNs) that allow the fit of a more general class of
statistical model (Hewitson and Crane, 1996; Trigo and Palutikof,
1999).  For  example, Crane  and  Hewitson  (1998)  apply  ANN
downscaling to GCM data in a climate change application over
the  west  coast  of  the  USA  using  atmospheric  circulation  and
humidity as predictors to represent the climate change signal. The
approach was shown to accurately capture the local climate as a
function of atmospheric forcing. In application to GCM data, the
regional  results  revealed  significant  differences  from  the  co-
located  GCM  grid  cell, e.g., a  significant  summer  increase  in
precipitation in the downscaled data (Figure 10.16). 

10.6.2.3 Weather typing
This synoptic downscaling approach relates “weather classes” to
local and regional climate variations. The weather classes may be
defined synoptically or fitted specifically for downscaling purposes
by  constructing  indices  of  airflow  (Conway  et  al., 1996).  The
frequency distributions of local or regional climate are then derived
by weighting the local climate states with the relative frequencies
of  the  weather  classes.  Climate  change  is  then  estimated  by

determining  the  change  of  the  frequency  of  weather  classes.
However, typing procedures contain a potentially critical weakness
in assuming that the characteristics of the weather classes do not
change.

In many cases, the local and regional climate states are derived
by sampling the observational record. For example, Wanner et al.
(1997) and Widmann and Schär (1997) used changing global to
continental scale synoptic structures to understand and reconstruct
Alpine climate variations. The technique was applied similarly for
New  Zealand  (Kidson  and  Watterson, 1995)  and  to  a  study  of
changing air pollution mechanisms (Jones and Davies, 2000). 

An extreme form of weather typing is the analogue method
(Zorita et al., 1995). A similar concept, although mathematically
more  demanding, is  Classification  And  Tree  Analysis  (CART)
which uses a randomised design for picking regional distributions
(Hughes  et  al., 1993;  Lettenmaier, 1995).  Both  analogue  and
CART approaches return approximately the right level of variance
and correct spatial correlation structures. 

Weather  typing  is  also  used  in  statistical-dynamical
downscaling (SDD), a hybrid approach with dynamical elements
(Frey-Buness et al., 1995 and see references in Appendix 10.4).
GCM results of a multi-year climate period are disaggregated into
non-overlapping multi-day episodes of quasi-stationary large-scale
flow  patterns.  Similar  episodes  are  then  grouped  in  classes  of
different  weather  types, and, members  of  these  classes  are
simulated  with  an  RCM.  The  RCM  results  are  statistically
evaluated, and the frequency of occurrence of the respective classes
determines  their  statistical  weight.  An  advantage  of  the  SDD
technique  over  other  empirical  downscaling  techniques  is  that  it
specifies  a  complete  three-dimensional  climate  state.  The
advantage  over  continuous  RCM  simulations  is  the  reduction  in
computing time, as demonstrated in Figure 10.17.

10.6.3 Issues in Statistical Downscaling

10.6.3.1 Temporal variance
Transfer function approaches and some weather typing methods
suffer from an under prediction of temporal variability, as this is
related only in part to the large-scale climate variations (see Katz
and Parlange, 1996). Two approaches have been used to restore
the  level  of  variability: inflation  and  randomisation.  In  the
inflation approach the variation is increased by the multiplication
of  a  suitable  factor  (Karl  et  al., 1990).  A  more  sophisticated
version  is  “expanded  downscaling”, a  variant  of  Canonical
Correlation  Analysis  that  ensures  the  right  level  of  variability
(Bürger, 1996; Huth, 1999; Dehn et al., 2000). In the randomisa-
tion approachs, the unrepresented variability is added as noise,
possibly conditioned on synoptic state (Buma and Dehn, 1998;
Dehn and Buma 1999; Hewitson, 1999; von Storch, 1999b).

Often weather generators have difficulty in representing low
frequency variance, and conditioning the generator parameters
on the large-scale state may alleviate this problem (see Katz and
Parlange, 1996;  Wilby, 1998;  Charles  et  al., 1999a).  For
example, Katz and Parlange (1993, 1996) modelled daily time-
series of precipitation as a chain-dependent process, conditioned
on a discrete circulation index. The results demonstrated that the
mean and standard deviation of intensity and the probability of
precipitation  varied  significantly  with  the  circulation, and
reproduced  the  precipitation  variance  statistics  of  the  observa-
tions better than the unconditioned model. The method describes
the  mean  precipitation  as  a  linear  function  of  the  circulation
state, and the standard deviation as a non-linear function (Figure
10.18). 

10.6.3.2 Evaluation
The  evaluation  of  downscaling  techniques  is  essential  but
problematic.  It  requires  that  the  validity  of  the  downscaling
functions  under  future  climates  be  demonstrated, and  that  the

predictors represent the climate change signal. It is not possible
to achieve this rigorously as the empirical knowledge available is
insufficient.  The  analysis  of  historical  developments, e.g., by
comparing  downscaling  models  between  recent  and  historical
periods (Jacobeit et al., 1998), as well as simulations with GCMs
can provide support for these assumptions. However, the success
of  a  statistical  downscaling  technique  for  representing  present
day  conditions  does  not  necessarily  imply  that  it  would  give
skilful results under changed climate conditions, and may need
independent  confirmation  from  climate  model  simulations
(Charles et al., 1999b).

The  classical  validation  approach  is  to  specify  the
downscaling  technique  from  a  segment  of  available  observa-
tional  evidence  and  then  assess  the  performance  of  the
empirical model by comparing its predictions with independent
observed  values.  This  approach  is  particularly  valuable  when
the  observational  record  is  long  and  documents  significant
changes (greater than 50 years in some cases; Hanssen-Bauer
and  Førland  (1998, 2000)).  An  example  is  the  analysis  of
absolute pressure tendencies in the North Atlantic (Kaas et al.,
1996).  As  another  example, Wilks  (1999b)  developed  a
downscaling function on dry years and found it functioned well
in wet years.

An alternative approach is to use a series of comparisons
between models and transfer functions (e.g., González-Rouco
et al., 1999, 2000). For instance, empirically derived links were
shown to be incorporated in a GCM (Busuioc et al., 1999) and
a RCM (Charles et al., 1999b). Then a climatic change due to
doubling of CO2 was estimated through the empirical link and
compared  with  the  result  of  the  dynamical  models.  In  both
cases, the  dynamical  response  was  found  consistent  for  the
winter season, indicating the validity of the empirical approach,
although less robust results were noted in the other seasons.

10.6.3.3 Choice of predictors
There is little systematic work explicitly evaluating the relative
skill of different atmospheric predictors (Winkler et al., 1997).
This is despite the availability of disparate studies that evaluate
a  broad  range  of  predictors, predictands  and  techniques  (see
Appendix 10.4). Useful summaries of downscaling techniques
and  the  predictors  used  are  also  presented  in  Rummukainen
(1997), Wilby (1998), and Wilby and Wigley (2000). 

The  choice  of  the  predictor  variables  is  of  utmost
importance.  For  example, Hewitson  and  Crane  (1996)  and
Hewitson  (1999)  have  demonstrated  how  the  down-scaled
projection of future change in mean precipitation and extreme
events  may  alter  significantly  depending  on  whether  or  not
humidity is included as a predictor. The downscaled results can
also depend on whether absolute or relative humidity is used as
a predictor (Charles et al., 1999b). The implication here is that
while a predictor may or may not appear as the most signifi-
cant when developing the downscaling function under present
climates, the changes in that predictor under a future climate
may  be  critical  for  determining  the  climate  change.  Some
estimation  procedures, for  example  stepwise  regression, are
not  able  to  recognise  this  and  exclude  variables  that  may  be
vital for climate change. 

620

Regional Climate Information – Evaluation and Projections

A similar issue exists with respect to downscaling tempera-
ture. Werner and von Storch (1993), Hanssen-Bauer and Førland
(2000) and Mietus (1999) noted that low-frequency changes in
local  temperature  during  the  20th  century  could  only  partly  be
related to changes in circulation. Schubert (1998) makes a vital
point in noting that changes of local temperature under doubled
atmospheric CO2 may be dominated by changes in the radiative
properties  of  the  atmosphere  rather  than  circulation  changes.
These  can  be  accounted  for  by  incorporating  the  large-scale
temperature field from the GCM as a surrogate indicator of the
changed radiative properties of the atmosphere (Dehn and Buma,
1999) or by using several large-scale predictors, such as gridded
temperature and circulation fields (e.g., Gyalistras et al., 1998;
Huth, 1999).

With the recent availability of global reanalyses (Kalnay et
al., 1996; Gibson et al., 1997), the number of candidate predictor
fields  has  been  greatly  enhanced  (Solman  and  Nuñez, 1999).
Prior  to  this  the  empirical  evidence  about  the  co-variability  of
regional/local predictands and large-scale predictors was limited
mostly to gridded near surface temperature and/or air pressure.
These  “new” data  sets  allow  significant  improvements  in  the
design  of  empirical  downscaling  techniques, in  particular  by
incorporating  knowledge  about  detailed  meteorological
processes. Taking advantage of these new data sets have allowed
systematic evaluation of a broad range of possible predictors for
daily  precipitation.  It  has  been  found  that  indicators  of  mid-
tropospheric  circulation  and  humidity  to  be  the  most  critical
predictors, with  surface  flow  and  humidity  information  being
important under orographic rainfall.

10.6.4 Intercomparison of Statistical Downscaling 

Methodologies

An increasing number of studies comparing different downscaling
studies have emerged since the SAR. However, there is a paucity
of  systematic  studies  that  use  common  data  sets  applied  to
different  procedures  and  over  the  same  geographic  region.  A
number of articles discussing different empirical and dynamical
downscaling approaches present summaries of the relative merits
and  shortcomings  of  different  procedures  (Giorgi  and  Mearns,
1991;  Hewitson  and  Crane, 1996;  Rummukainen, 1997;  Wilby
and Wigley, 1997; Gyalistras et al., 1998; Kidson and Thompson,
1998; Biau et al., 1999; Murphy, 1999; ; von Storch, 1999b; Zorita
and  von  Storch, 1999;  Murphy, 2000).  However, these  inter-
comparisons vary widely with respect to predictors, predictands
and measures of skill. Consequently, a systematic, internationally
co-ordinated  inter-comparison  project  would  be  particularly
helpful in addressing this issue.

The  most  systematic  and  comprehensive  study  so  far
compared  empirical  transfer  functions, weather  generators, and
circulation  classification  schemes  over  the  same  geographical
region  using  climate  change  simulations  and  observational  data
(Wilby  and  Wigley, 1997;  Wilby, 1998).  This  considered  a
demanding task to downscale daily precipitation for six locations
over North America, spanning arid, moist tropical, maritime, mid-
latitude, and  continental  climate  regimes.  Fourteen  measures  of
skill were used, strongly emphasising daily statistics, and included

wet  and  dry  spell  length, 95th  percentile  values, wet-wet  day
probabilities, and  several  measures  of  standard  deviation.
Downscaling  procedures  in  the  study  included  two  different
weather generators, two variants of an ANN-based technique, and
two  stochastic/circulation  classification  schemes  based  on
vorticity classes.

The results require careful evaluation as they indicate relative
merits  and  shortcoming  of  the  different  procedures  rather  than
recommending one over another. Overall, the weather generators
captured the wet-day occurrence and the amount distributions in
the data well, but were less successful at capturing the interannual
variability, while  the  opposite  results  was  found  for  the  ANN
procedures.  The  stochastic/circulation  typing  schemes, as
something of a combination of the principles underlying the other
methods, were a better all-round performer.

A factor not yet fully evaluated in any comparative study is
that  of  the  temporal  evolution  of  daily  events  which  may  be
critical for some applications, e.g., hydrological modelling. While
a  downscaling  procedure  may  correctly  represent, for  example,
the number of rain days, the temporal sequencing of these may be
as important. Zorita et al. (1995) and Zorita and von Storch (1997)
compared a CART technique, a CCA and an ANN technique with
the analogue technique, and found the simpler analogue technique
performed as well as the more complicated methods. 

A number of analyses have dealt with the relative merits of
non-linear and linear approaches. For example, the relationships
between  daily  precipitation  and  circulation  indicators  are  often
non-linear (Conway et al., 1996; Brandsma and Buishand, 1997).
Similarly, Corte-Real et al. (1995) applied multivariate adaptive
regression  splines  (MARS)  to  approximate  the  non-linear
relationships  between  large-scale  circulation  and  monthly  mean
precipitation. In a comparison of kriging and analogues, Biau et
al. (1999) and von Storch (1999c) show that kriging resulted in
better specifications of averaged quantities but too low variance,
whereas analogues returned the right variance but lower correla-
tion.  In  general, it  appears  that  downscaling  of  the  short-term
climate variance benefits from the use of non-linear models. 

Most  of  the  comparative  studies  mentioned  above  come  to
the conclusion that techniques differ in their success of specifying
regional climate, and the relative merits and shortcomings emerge
differently in different studies and regions. This is not surprising,
as  there  is  considerable  flexibility  in  setting  up  a  downscaling
procedure, and the suitability of a technique and the adaptation to
the problem at hand varies. This flexibility is a distinct advantage
of empirical methods.

10.6.5 Summary and Recommendations

A  broad  range  of  statistical  downscaling  techniques  has  been
developed  in  the  past  few  years.  Users  of  GCM-based  climate
information  may  choose  from  a  large  variety  of  methods
conditional upon their needs. Weather generators provide realistic
sequences  of  high  temporal  resolution  events.  With  transfer
functions, statistics  of  regional  and  local  climate, such  as
conditional means or quantiles, may consistently be derived from
GCM generated data. Techniques based on weather typing serve
both purposes, but are less adapted to specific applications.

Regional Climate Information – Evaluation and Projections

Downscaling  means  post-processing  GCM  data;  it  cannot
account  for  insufficiencies  in  the  driving  GCM.  As  statistical
techniques combine the existing empirical knowledge, statistical
downscaling can describe only those links that have been observed
in the past. Thus, it is based on the assumption that presently found
links will prevail under different climate conditions. It may be, in
particular, that  under  present  conditions  some  predictors  appear
less relevant, but become significant in describing climate change.
It  is  recommended  to  test  statistical  downscaling  methods  by
comparing their estimates with high resolution dynamical model
simulations. The advent of decades-long atmospheric reanalyses
has  offered  the  community  many  more  atmospheric  large-scale
variables to incorporate as predictors.

Statistical downscaling requires the availability of long and
homogeneous  data  series  spanning  the  range  of  observed
variance, while  the  computational  resources  needed  are  small.
Therefore, statistical  downscaling  techniques  are  suitable  tools
for scientific communities without access to supercomputers and
with  little  experience  in  process-based  climate  modelling.
Furthermore, statistical  techniques  may  relate  directly  GCM-
derived  data  to  impact  relevant  variables, such  as  ecological
variables  or  ocean  wave  heights, which  are  not  simulated  by
contemporary climate models.

It is concluded that statistical downscaling techniques are a
viable  complement  to  process-based  dynamical  modelling  in
many cases, and will remain so in the future. 

10.7 Intercomparison of Methods

Few  formal  comparative  studies  of  different  regionalisation
techniques  have  been  carried  out. To  date, published  work  has
mostly focused on the comparison between RCMs and statistical
downscaling techniques. Early applications of RCMs for climate
change  simulations  (Giorgi  and  Mearns, 1991;  Giorgi  et  al.,
1994) compared the models against observations or against the
driving GCMs, but not against statistical/empirical techniques. 

Kidson  and  Thompson  (1998)  compared  the  RAMS
(Regional Atmospheric Modelling System) dynamical model and
a  statistical  regression-based  technique.  Both  approaches  were
applied  to  downscale  reanalysis  data  (ECMWF)  over  New
Zealand to a grid resolution of 50 km. The statistical downscaling
used a screening regression technique to predict local minimum
and  maximum  temperature  and  daily  precipitation, at  both
monthly  and  daily  time-scales. The  regression  technique  limits
each  regression  equation  to  five  predictors  (selected  from
Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of atmospheric fields).
Both monthly and daily results indicated little difference in skill
between the two techniques, and Kidson and Thompson (1998)
suggested that, subject to the assumption of statistical relation-
ships remaining viable under a future climate, the computational
requirements do not favour the use of the dynamical model. They
also noted, however, that the dynamical model performed better
with the convective components of precipitation.

Bates  et  al. (1998)  compared  a  south-western  Australia
simulation  using  the  DARLAM  (CSIRO  Division  of
Atmospheric Research Limited Area Model) model with a down-
scaled DARLAM simulation where the downscaling model had

been fitted independently to observational data. The downscaling
reproduced observed precipitation probabilities and wet and dry
spell  frequencies  while  the  DARLAM  simulation  under-
estimated  the  frequency  of  dry  spells  and  over  estimated  the
probability of precipitation and the frequency of wet spells. In a
climate change follow-on experiment, again using both methods,
Charles et al. (1999b) found a small decrease in probability of
precipitation under future climate conditions.

Murphy  (1999)  evaluated  the  UK  Meteorological  Office
Unified  Model  (UM)  RCM  over  Europe  against  a  statistical
downscaling model based on regression. Monthly mean surface
temperature and precipitation anomalies were down-scaled using
predictor sets chosen from a range of candidate variables similar
to  those  used  by  Kidson  and  Thompson  (1998)  (EOFs  of
atmospheric fields). The results showed similar levels of skill for
the dynamical and statistical methods, in line with the Kidson and
Thompson  (1998)  study. The  statistical  method  was  nominally
better  for  summertime  estimates  of  temperature, while  the
dynamical model gave better estimates of wintertime precipita-
tion. Again, the conclusion was drawn that the sophistication of
the  dynamical  model  shows  little  advantage  over  statistical
techniques, at least for present day climates.

Murphy (2000) continued the comparative study by deriving
climate  change  projections  for  2080  to  2100  from  a  simulation
with  the  HadCM2  AOGCM.  The  dynamical  and  statistical
downscaling  techniques  were  the  same  regional  and  statistical
models as used by Murphy (1999). The statistical and dynamical
techniques produced significantly different predictions of climate
change, despite  exhibiting  similar  skill  when  validated  against
present day observations. The study identifies two main sources of
divergence  between  the  dynamical  and  statistical  techniques:
firstly, differences  between  the  strength  of  the  observed  and
simulated  predictor/predictand  relationships, and  secondly,
omission  from  the  regression  equations  of  variables  which
represent  climate  change  feedbacks, but  are  weak  predictors  of
natural variability. In particular, the exclusion of specific humidity
led to differences between the dynamical and statistical simulations
of  precipitation  change.  This  point  would  seem  to  confirm  the
humidity issue raised in Section 10.6.3 (Hewitson and Crane 1996,
Crane and Hewitson, 1998, Charles et al., 1999b; Hewitson 1999).
Mearns et al. (1999) compared RCM simulations and statis-
tical downscaling using a regional model and a semi-empirical
technique based on stochastic procedures conditioned on weather
types  which  were  classified  from  circulation  fields  (700hPa
geopotential heights). While Mearns et al. suggest that the semi-
empirical approach incorporates more physical meaning into the
relationships than a pure statistical approach does, this approach
does  impose  the  assumption  that  the  circulation  patterns  are
robust into a future climate in addition to the normal assumption
that the cross-scale relationships are stationary in time. For both
techniques, the  driving  fields  were  from  the  CSIRO  AOGCM
(Watterson et al., 1995). The variables of interest were maximum
and minimum daily temperature and precipitation over central-
northern  USA  (Nebraska).  As  with  the  preceding  studies, the
validation under present climate conditions indicated similar skill
levels  for  the  dynamical  and  statistical  approaches, with  some
advantage by the statistical technique.

622

Regional Climate Information – Evaluation and Projections

In line with the Murphy (2000) study, larger differences were
also noted by Mearns et al. (1999) when climate change projec-
tions  were  produced.  Notably  for  temperature, the  statistical
technique  produced  an  amplified  seasonal  cycle  compared  to
both the RCM and CSIRO data, although similar changes in daily
temperature variances were found in both the RCM and the statis-
tical  technique  (with  the  statistical  approach  producing  mostly
decreases).  The  spatial  patterns  of  change  showed  greater
variability in the RCM compared with the statistical technique.
Mearns et al. (1999) suggested that some of the differences found
in  the  results  were  due  to  the  climate  change  simulation
exceeding the range of data used to develop the statistical model,
while the decreases in variance were likely to be a true reflection
of  changes  in  the  circulation  controls. The  precipitation  results
from Mearns et al. (1999) are different from earlier studies with
the same RCM (e.g., Giorgi et al., 1998) that produced few statis-
tically significant changes. 

Extending  the  comparison  beyond  simple  methodological
performance, Wilby  et  al. (2000)  compared  hydrological
responses  using  data  from  dynamically  and  statistically  down-
scaled  climate  model  output  for  the  Animas  River  basin  in
Colorado, USA. While not a climate change projection, the use
of output from an RCM and a statistical downscaling approach to
drive a distributed hydrological model exemplify the objective of
the downscaling. The results indicate that both the statistical and
dynamical  methods  had  greater  skill  (in  terms  of  modelling
hydrology) than the coarse resolution reanalysis output used to
drive the downscaling. The statistical method had the advantage
of  requiring  very  few  parameters, an  attribute  making  the
procedure  attractive  for  many  hydrological  applications.  The
dynmical model output, once elevation-corrected, provided better
water  balance  estimates  than  raw  or  elevation-corrected
reanalysis output. 

Overall, the  above  comparative  studies  indicate  that  for
present climate both techniques have similar skill. Since statis-
tical models are based on observed relationships between predic-
tands and predictors, this result may represent a further validation
of  the  performance  of  RCMs.  Under  future  climate  conditions
more  differences  are  found  between  the  techniques, and  the
question  arises  as  to  which  is  “more  correct”.  While  the
dynamical model should clearly provide a better physical basis
for change, it is still unclear whether different regional models
generate  similar  downscaled  changes.  With  regard  to  statis-
tical/empirical  techniques, it  would  seem  that  careful  attention
must be given to the choice of predictors, and that methodologies
which  internally  select  predictors  based  on  explanatory  power
under  present  climates  may  exclude  predictors  important  for
determining change under future climate modes. 

10.8 Summary Assessment

Today different modelling tools are available to provide climate
change information at the regional scale. Coupled AOGCMs are
the fundamental models used to simulate the climatic response to
anthropogenic  forcings  and, to  date, results  from  AOGCM
simulations  have  provided  the  climate  information  for  the  vast
majority of impact studies. On the other hand, resolution limita-

tions  pose  severe  constraints  on  the  usefulness  of  AOGCM
information, especially  in  regions  characterised  by  complex
physiographic  settings.  Three  classes  of  regionalisation
techniques have been developed to enhance the regional informa-
tion of coupled AOGCMs: high resolution and variable resolution
time-slice AGCM experiments, regional climate modelling, and
empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical approaches. 

Since the SAR, substantial progress has been achieved in all
regionalisation  methods, including  better  understanding  of  the
techniques, development of a wide variety of modelling systems
and  methods, application  of  the  techniques  to  a  wide  range  of
studies  and  regional  settings, and  reduction  of  model  biases.
Modelling  work  has  indicated  that  regionalisation  techniques
enhance some aspects of AOGCM regional information, such as
the high resolution spatial detail of precipitation and temperature,
and the statistics of daily precipitation events. It is important to
stress  that  AOGCM  information  is  the  starting  point  for  the
application of all regionalisation techniques, so that a foremost
requirement in the simulation of regional climate change is that
the AOGCMs  simulate  well  the  circulation  features  that  affect
regional climates. In this respect, indications are that the perform-
ance of current AOGCMs is generally improving.

Analysis of AOGCM simulations for broad (sub-continental
scale) regions indicates that biases in the simulation of present
day regionally and seasonally averaged surface climate variables,
although highly variable across regions and models, are generally
improved  compared  with  the  previous  generation  models. This
implies increased confidence in simulated climatic changes. The
performance  of  models  in  reproducing  observed  interannual
variability varies across regions and models.

Regional  analysis  of  AOGCM  transient  simulations
extending to 2100, for different scenarios of GHG increase and
sulphate  aerosol  effects, and  with  a  number  of  modelling
systems  (some  simulations  include  ensembles  of  realisations)
indicate that the average climatic changes for the late decades of
the 21st century compared to present day climate vary substan-
tially  across  regions  and  models.  The  primary  source  of
uncertainty  in  the  simulated  changes  is  associated  with  inter-
model range of changes, with inter-scenario and intra-ensemble
range of simulated changes being less pronounced. Despite the
range  of  inter-model  results, some  common  patterns  of  sub-
continental  scale  climatic  changes  are  emerging, and  thus
providing  increased  confidence  in  the  simulation  of  these
changes. 

Work  performed  with  all  regionalisation  techniques
indicates  that  sub-GCM  grid  scale  structure  in  the  regional
climate change signal can occur in response to regional and local
forcings, although more work is needed to assess the statistical
significance  of  the  sub-GCM  grid  scale  signal.  In  particular,
modelling  evidence  clearly  indicates  that  topography, land  use
and  the  surface  hydrologic  cycle  strongly  affect  the  surface
climate change signal at the regional to local scale. This implies
that the use of AOGCM information for impact studies needs to
be  taken  cautiously, especially  in  regions  characterised  by
pronounced sub-GCM grid scale variability in forcings, and that
suitable regionalisation techniques should be used to enhance the
AOGCM results over these regions.

Considerations  of  various  types  may  enter  the  choice  of
the  regionalisation  technique, as  different  techniques  may  be
most suitable for different applications and different working
environments.  High  resolution  AGCMs  offer  the  primary
advantage  of  global  coverage  and  two-way  interactions
between  regional  and  global  climate.  However, due  to  their
computational  cost, the  resolution  increase  that  can  be
expected from these models is limited. Variable resolution and
RCMs  yield  a  greater  increase  in  resolution, with  current
RCMs reaching resolutions as fine as a few tens of kilometres
or  less.  RCMs  can  capture  physical  processes  and  feedbacks
occurring  at  the  regional  scale, but  they  are  affected  by  the
errors of the AOGCM driving fields, and they do not represent
regional-to-global climate feedbacks. The effects of regional-
to-global feedback processes depend on the specific problem
and in many cases may not be important. Two-way GCM-RCM
nesting would allow the description of such effects, and some
research  efforts  in  that  direction  are  currently  under  way.
Statistical  downscaling  techniques  offer  the  advantages  of
being  computationally  inexpensive, of  providing  local
information which is needed in many impact applications, and
of offering the possibility of being tailored to specific applica-

tions.  However, these  techniques  have  limitations  inherent  in
their empirical nature.

The combined use of different techniques may provide the
most suitable approach in many instances. For example, a high-
resolution  AGCM  simulation  could  represent  an  important
intermediate  step  between AOGCM  information  and  RCM  or
statistical downscaling models. The convergence of results from
different approaches applied to the same problem can increase
the  confidence  in  the  results  and  differences  between
approaches can help to understand the behaviour of the models.
Despite recent improvements and developments, regional-
isation  research  is  still  a  maturing  process  and  the  related
uncertainties are still rather poorly known. One of the reasons
for  this  is  that  most  regionalisation  research  activities  have
been  carried  out  independently  of  each  other  and  aimed  at
specific  objectives.  Therefore  a  coherent  picture  of  regional
climate change via available regionalisation techniques cannot
yet be drawn. More co-ordinated efforts are thus necessary to
improve  the  integrated  hierarchy  of  models, evaluate  the
different  methodologies, intercompare  methods  and  models
and  apply  these  methods  to  climate  change  research  in  a
comprehensive strategy.

Technique (utilised in the above categories):
• WG = weather generators (e.g.: Markov-type procedures, conditional probability).
• TF = transfer functions (e.g.: Regression, canonical correlation analysis, and artificial neural networks).
• WT = weather typing (e.g.: cluster analysis, self-organising map, and extreme value distribution).

Predictor variables: C = circulation based (e.g.: sea level pressure fields and geopotential height fields).  
T = temperature (at surface or on one or more atmospheric levels).  TH = thickness between pressure levels. 
VOR  = vorticity. W = wind related. Q = specific humidity (at surface or on one or more atmospheric levels).  
RH = relative humidity (at surface or on one or more atmospheric levels).  Cld = cloud cover.   
ZG = spatial gradients of the predictors.   O = other.

Predictands: T (temperature); Tmax (maximum temperature); Tmin (minimum temperature); P (precipitation).

Region is the geographic domain.

Time is the time-scale of the predictor and predictand: H (hourly), D (daily), M (monthly), S (seasonal), and A (annual).

Changes in Sea Level

Executive Summary

This  chapter  assesses  the  current  state  of  knowledge  of  the
rate  of  change  of  global  average  and  regional  sea  level  in
relation  to  climate  change.  We  focus  on  the  20th  and  21st
centuries.  However, because  of  the  slow  response  to  past
conditions  of  the  oceans  and  ice  sheets  and  the  consequent
land movements, we consider changes in sea level prior to the
historical record, and we also look over a thousand years into
the future.

Past changes in sea level
From recent analyses, our conclusions are as follows:

• Since the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago, sea
level has risen by over 120 m at locations far from present and
former ice sheets, as a result of loss of mass from these ice
sheets. There was a rapid rise between 15,000 and 6,000 years
ago at an average rate of 10 mm/yr.

• Based on geological data, global average sea level may have
risen at an average rate of about 0.5 mm/yr over the last 6,000
years and at an average rate of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr over the last
3,000 years.

• Vertical land movements are still occurring today as a result of
these large transfers of mass from the ice sheets to the ocean. 

• During the last 6,000 years, global average sea level variations
on time-scales of a few hundred years and longer are likely to
have been less than 0.3 to 0.5 m. 

• Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global average sea level rise
during the 20th century is in the range 1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr, with a
central value of 1.5 mm/yr (as with other ranges of uncertainty,
it is not implied that the central value is the best estimate).

• Based on the few very long tide gauge records, the average
rate of sea level rise has been larger during the 20th century
than the 19th century. 

641

century, AOGCM  simulations  result  in  rates  of  thermal
expansion of 0.3 to 0.7 mm/yr. 

• The mass of the ocean, and thus sea level, changes as water is
exchanged  with  glaciers  and  ice  caps.  Observational  and
modelling studies of glaciers and ice caps indicate a contribu-
tion to sea level rise of 0.2 to 0.4 mm/yr averaged over the 20th
century. 

•  Climate  changes  during  the  20th  century  are  estimated  from
modelling studies to have led to contributions of between –0.2
and  0.0  mm/yr  from  Antarctica  (the  results  of  increasing
precipitation)  and  0.0  to  0.1  mm/yr  from  Greenland  (from
changes in both precipitation and runoff). 

•  Greenland  and Antarctica  have  contributed  0.0  to  0.5  mm/yr
over the 20th century as a result of long-term adjustment to past
climate changes. 

• Changes in terrestrial storage of water over the period 1910 to
1990  are  estimated  to  have  contributed  from  –1.1  to
+0.4 mm/yr of sea level rise. 

The  sum  of  these  components  indicates  a  rate  of  eustatic  sea
level  rise  (corresponding  to  a  change  in  ocean  volume)  from
1910  to  1990  ranging  from  –0.8  to  2.2 mm/yr, with  a  central
value of 0.7 mm/yr. The upper bound is close to the observational
upper bound (2.0 mm/yr), but the central value is less than the
observational  lower  bound  (1.0  mm/yr), i.e., the  sum  of
components  is  biased  low  compared  to  the  observational
estimates. The sum of components indicates an acceleration of
only  0.2  mm/yr/century, with  a  range  from  –1.1
to +0.7 mm/yr/century, consistent with observational finding of
no  acceleration  in  sea  level  rise  during  the  20th  century.  The
estimated  rate  of  sea  level  rise  from  anthropogenic  climate
change from 1910 to 1990 (from modelling studies of thermal
expansion, glaciers and ice sheets) ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 mm/yr.
It is very likely that 20th century warming has contributed signif-
icantly to the observed sea level rise, through thermal expansion
of sea water and widespread loss of land ice. 

• No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise during

the 20th century has been detected. 

•  There  is  decadal  variability  in  extreme  sea  levels  but  no
evidence of widespread increases in extremes other than that
associated with a change in the mean.

Projected sea level changes from 1990 to 2100
Projections  of  components  contributing  to  sea  level  change
from 1990 to 2100 (this period is chosen for consistency with
the  IPCC  Second  Assessment  Report), using  a  range  of
AOGCMs  following  the  IS92a  scenario  (including  the  direct
effect of sulphate aerosol emissions) give:

Factors affecting present day sea level change
Global average sea level is affected by many factors. Our assess-
ment of the most important is as follows. 

• Ocean thermal expansion leads to an increase in ocean volume
at  constant  mass.  Observational  estimates  of  about  1 mm/yr
over recent decades are similar to values of 0.7 to 1.1 mm/yr
obtained from Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models
(AOGCMs) over a comparable period. Averaged over the 20th

• thermal expansion of 0.11 to 0.43 m, accelerating through the

21st century; 

• a glacier contribution of 0.01 to 0.23 m; 
• a Greenland contribution of –0.02 to 0.09 m;
• an Antarctic contribution of –0.17 to 0.02 m. 

Including thawing of permafrost, deposition of sediment, and
the ongoing contributions from ice sheets as a result of climate
change since the Last Glacial Maximum, we obtain a range of

642

Changes in Sea Level

global-average sea level rise from 0.11 to 0.77 m. This range
reflects systematic uncertainties in modelling.

For the 35 SRES scenarios, we project a sea level rise of
0.09 to 0.88 m for 1990 to 2100, with a central value of 0.48 m.
The central value gives an average rate of 2.2 to 4.4 times the
rate over the 20th century. If terrestrial storage continued at its
present  rates, the  projections  could  be  changed  by  –0.21  to
+0.11 m.  For  an  average AOGCM, the  SRES  scenarios  give
results which differ by 0.02 m or less for the first half of the 21st
century. By 2100, they vary over a range amounting to about
50% of the central value. Beyond the 21st century, sea level rise
will depend strongly on the emissions scenario.

The West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) has attracted special
attention because it contains enough ice to raise sea level by 6
m and because of suggestions that instabilities associated with
its  being  grounded  below  sea  level  may  result  in  rapid  ice
discharge when the surrounding ice shelves are weakened. The
range of projections given above makes no allowance for ice-
dynamic instability of the WAIS. It is now widely agreed that
major  loss  of  grounded  ice  and  accelerated  sea  level  rise  are
very unlikely during the 21st century.

Our  confidence  in  the  regional  distribution  of  sea  level
change from AOGCMs is low because there is little similarity
between  models.  However, models  agree  on  the  qualitative
conclusion  that  the  range  of  regional  variation  is  substantial
compared  with  the  global  average  sea  level  rise.  Nearly  all
models project greater than average rise in the Arctic Ocean and
less than average rise in the Southern Ocean.

Land movements, both isostatic and tectonic, will continue
through  the  21st  century  at  rates  which  are  unaffected  by
climate change. It can be expected that by 2100 many regions
currently experiencing relative sea level fall will instead have a
rising relative sea level. 

Extreme  high  water  levels  will  occur  with  increasing
frequency (i.e. with reducing return period) as a result of mean
sea  level  rise.  Their  frequency  may  be  further  increased  if
storms become more frequent or severe as a result of climate
change.

Longer term changes
If  greenhouse  gas  concentrations  were  stabilised, sea  level
would nonetheless continue to rise for hundreds of years. After
500  years, sea  level  rise  from  thermal  expansion  may  have
reached  only  half  of  its  eventual  level, which  models  suggest
may lie within ranges of 0.5 to 2.0 m and 1 to 4 m for CO2 levels
of twice and four times pre-industrial, respectively. 

Glacier  retreat  will  continue  and  the  loss  of  a  substantial
fraction of the total glacier mass is likely. Areas that are currently
marginally glaciated are most likely to become ice-free.

Ice sheets will continue to react to climate change during
the next several thousand years even if the climate is stabilised.
Models  project  that  a  local  annual-average  warming  of  larger
than  3°C  sustained  for  millennia  would  lead  to  virtually  a
complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet. For a warming over
Greenland  of  5.5°C, consistent  with  mid-range  stabilisation
scenarios, the Greenland ice sheet contributes about 3 m in 1,000
years. For a warming of 8°C, the contribution is about 6 m, the
ice  sheet  being  largely  eliminated.  For  smaller  warmings, the
decay of the ice sheet would be substantially slower.

Current  ice  dynamic  models  project  that  the  WAIS  will
contribute no more than 3 mm/yr to sea level rise over the next
thousand years, even if significant changes were to occur in the
ice  shelves.  However, we  note  that  its  dynamics  are  still
inadequately understood to make firm projections, especially on
the longer time-scales. 

Apart from the possibility of an internal ice dynamic instability,
surface melting will affect the long-term viability of the Antarctic
ice sheet. For warmings of more than 10°C, simple runoff models
predict that a zone of net mass loss would develop on the ice sheet
surface.  Irreversible  disintegration  of  the  WAIS  would  result
because the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once its margins
are subjected to surface melting and begin to recede. Such a disinte-
gration  would  take  at  least  a  few  millennia.  Thresholds  for  total
disintegration  of  the  East Antarctic  Ice  Sheet  by  surface  melting
involve warmings above 20°C, a situation that has not occurred for
at least 15 million years and which is far more than predicted by any
scenario of climate change currently under consideration.

Changes in Sea Level

11.1 Introduction

Sea  level  change  is  an  important  consequence  of  climate
change, both  for  societies  and  for  the  environment.  In  this
chapter, we deal with the measurement and physical causes of
sea level change, and with predictions for global-average and
regional  changes  over  the  next  century  and  further  into  the
future. We reach qualitatively similar conclusions to those of
Warrick  et  al.  (1996)  in  the  IPCC  WGI  Second Assessment
Report  (IPCC, 1996)  (hereafter  SAR).  However, improved
measurements  and  advances  in  modelling  have  given  more
detailed  information  and  greater  confidence  in  several  areas.
The impacts of sea level change on the populations and eco-
systems of coastal zones are discussed in the IPCC WGII TAR
(IPCC, 2001).

The  level  of  the  sea  varies  as  a  result  of  processes
operating  on  a  great  range  of  time-scales, from  seconds  to
millions of years. Our concern in this report is with climate-
related  processes  that  have  an  effect  on  the  time-scale  of
decades  to  centuries.  In  order  to  establish  whether  there  is  a
significant  anthropogenic  influence  on  sea  level, the  longer-
term and non-climate-related processes have to be evaluated as
well. 

“Mean sea level” at the coast is defined as the height of the
sea  with  respect  to  a  local  land  benchmark, averaged  over  a
period  of  time, such  as  a  month  or  a  year, long  enough  that
fluctuations  caused  by  waves  and  tides  are  largely  removed.
Changes in mean sea level as measured by coastal tide gauges
are called “relative sea level changes”, because they can come
about either by movement of the land on which the tide gauge
is  situated  or  by  changes  in  the  height  of  the  adjacent  sea
surface (both considered with respect to the centre of the Earth
as a fixed reference). These two terms can have similar rates
(several mm/yr) on time-scales greater than decades. To infer
sea  level  changes  arising  from  changes  in  the  ocean, the
movement of the land needs to be subtracted from the records
of  tide  gauges  and  geological  indicators  of  past  sea  level.
Widespread land movements are caused by the isostatic adjust-
ment resulting from the slow viscous response of the mantle to
the melting of large ice sheets and the addition of their mass to
the oceans since the end of the most recent glacial period (“Ice
Age”) (Section 11.2.4.1). Tectonic land movements, both rapid
displacements (earthquakes) and slow movements (associated
with mantle convection and sediment transport), can also have
an important effect on local sea level (Section 11.2.6).

We estimate that global average eustatic sea level change
over the last hundred years is within the range 0.10 to 0.20 m
(Section 11.3.2). (“Eustatic” change is that which is caused by
an alteration to the volume of water in the world ocean.) These
values are somewhat higher than the sum of the predictions of
the contributions to sea level rise (Section 11.4). The discrep-
ancy reflects the imperfect state of current scientific knowledge.
In an attempt to quantify the processes and their associated rates
of  sea  level  change, we  have  critically  evaluated  the  error
estimates  (Box  11.1).  However, the  uncertainties  remain
substantial, although  some  have  narrowed  since  the  SAR  on
account of improved observations and modelling.

Box 11.1: Accuracy

For  indicating  the  uncertainty  of  data  (measurements  or
model results), two options have been used in this chapter.
1.  For  data  fulfilling  the  usual  statistical  requirements, the
uncertainty is indicated as ± 1 standard deviation (± 1σ).
2.  For  limited  data  sets  or  model  results, the  full  range  is
shown  by  quoting  either  all  available  data  or  the  two
extremes. In these cases, outliers may be included in the
data set and the use of an arithmetic mean or central value
might be misleading. 

To  combine  uncertainties  when  adding  quantities, we  used
the following procedures:
• Following the usual practice for independent uncertainties,
the variances were added (i.e. the standard deviations were
combined in quadrature).

•  Ranges  were  combined  by  adding  their  extreme  values,
because  in  these  cases  the  true  value  is  very  likely  to  lie
within the overall range.

• To combine a standard deviation with a range, the standard
deviation  was  first  used  to  derive  a  range  by  taking  ±  2
standard  deviations  about  the  mean, and  then  the  ranges
were combined.

Eustatic sea level change results from changes to the density
or  to  the  total  mass  of  water.  Both  of  these  relate  to  climate.
Density is reduced by thermal expansion occurring as the ocean
warms. Observational estimates of interior temperature changes
in the ocean reported by Warrick et al. (1996) were limited, and
estimates  of  thermal  expansion  were  made  from  simple  ocean
models. Since the SAR, more observational analyses have been
made  and  estimates  from  several  Atmosphere-Ocean  General
Circulation Models (AOGCMs) have become available (Section
11.2.1). Thermal expansion is expected to contribute the largest
component to sea level rise over the next hundred years (Section
11.5.1.1). Because of the large heat capacity of the ocean, thermal
expansion would continue for many centuries after climate had
been stabilised (Section 11.5.4.1).

Exchanges with water stored on land will alter the mass of the
ocean. (Note that sea level would be unaffected by the melting of
sea  ice, whose  weight  is  already  supported  by  the  ocean.)
Groundwater extraction and impounding water in reservoirs result
in a direct influence on sea level (Section 11.2.5). Climate change
is projected to reduce the amount of water frozen in glaciers and
ice caps (Sections 11.2.2, 11.5.1.1) because of increased melting
and  evaporation.  Greater  melting  and  evaporation  on  the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Sections 11.2.3, 11.5.1.1) is
also projected, but might be outweighed by increased precipita-
tion. Increased discharge of ice from the ice sheets into the ocean
is  also  possible.  The  ice  sheets  react  to  climate  change  by
adjusting their shape and size on time-scales of up to millennia, so
they could still be gaining or losing mass as a result of climate
variations over a history extending as far back as the last glacial
period, and they would continue to change for thousands of years
after climate had been stabilised (Section 11.5.4.3).

Changes in Sea Level

Sea  level  change  is  not  expected  to  be  geographically
uniform (Section 11.5.2), so information about its distribution is
needed to inform assessments of the impacts on coastal regions.
Since  the  SAR, such  information  has  been  calculated  from
several AOGCMs. The pattern depends on ocean surface fluxes,
interior conditions and circulation. The most serious impacts are
caused not only by changes in mean sea level but by changes to
extreme sea levels (Section 11.5.3.2), especially storm surges and
exceptionally  high  waves, which  are  forced  by  meteorological
conditions. Climate-related changes in these therefore also have
to be considered. 

11.2 Factors Contributing to Sea Level Change

11.2.1 Ocean Processes

The  pattern  of  sea  level  in  ocean  basins  is  maintained  by
atmospheric  pressure  and  air-sea  fluxes  of  momentum  (surface
wind stress), heat and fresh water (precipitation, evaporation, and
fresh-water runoff from the land). The ocean is strongly density
stratified with motion preferentially along density surfaces (e.g.
Ledwell  et  al., 1993, 1998).  This  allows  properties  of  water
masses, set by interaction with the atmosphere or sea ice, to be
carried thousands of kilometres into the ocean interior and thus
provides a pathway for warming of surface waters to enter the
ocean interior.

As the ocean warms, the density decreases and thus even at
constant mass the volume of the ocean increases. This thermal
expansion (or steric sea level rise) occurs at all ocean tempera-
tures  and  is  one  of  the  major  contributors  to  sea  level  changes
during the 20th and 21st centuries. Water at higher temperature or
under greater pressure (i.e., at greater depth) expands more for a
given heat input, so the global average expansion is affected by
the distribution of heat within the ocean. Salinity changes within
the ocean also have a significant impact on the local density and
thus local sea level, but have little effect on global average sea
level change. 

The rate of climate change depends strongly on the rate at
which  heat  is  removed  from  the  ocean  surface  layers  into  the
ocean interior; if heat is taken up more readily, climate change is
retarded but sea level rises more rapidly. Climate change simula-
tion requires a model which represents the sequestration of heat
in  the  ocean  and  the  evolution  of  temperature  as  a  function  of
depth. 

The large heat capacity of the ocean means that there will be
considerable delay before the full effects of surface warming are
felt throughout the depth of the ocean. As a result, the ocean will
not be in equilibrium and global average sea level will continue
to rise for centuries after atmospheric greenhouse gas concentra-
tions have stabilised. 

The geographical distribution of sea level change is princi-
pally  determined  by  alterations  to  the  ocean  density  structure,
with  consequent  effects  on  ocean  circulation, caused  by  the
modified surface momentum, heat and water fluxes. Hsieh and
Bryan (1996) have demonstrated how the first signals of sea level
rise are propagated rapidly from a source region (for instance, a
region  of  heat  input)  but  that  full  adjustment  takes  place  more

slowly.  As  a  result, the  geographical  distribution  of  sea  level
change may take many decades to centuries to arrive at its final
state. 

11.2.1.1 Observational estimates of ocean warming and ocean 

thermal expansion

Previous  IPCC  sea  level  change  assessments  (Warrick  and
Oerlemans, 1990; Warrick et al., 1996) noted that there were a
number of time-series which indicate warming of the ocean and
a resultant thermal expansion (i.e. a steric sea level rise) but there
was limited geographical coverage. Comparison of recent ocean
temperature  data  sets  (particularly  those  collected  during  the
World  Ocean  Circulation  Experiment)  with  historical  data  is
beginning  to  reveal  large-scale  changes  in  the  ocean  interior.
(Section 2.2.2.5 includes additional material on ocean warming,
including  studies  for  which  there  are  no  estimates  of  ocean
thermal  expansion.)  However, the  absence  of  comprehensive
long  ocean  time-series  data  makes  detection  of  trends  difficult
and  prone  to  contamination  by  decadal  and  interannual
variability.  While  there  has  been  some  work  on  interannual
variability in the North Atlantic (e.g. Levitus, 1989a,b, 1990) and
North  Pacific  (e.g.  Yasuda  and  Hanawa, 1997;  Zhang  and
Levitus, 1997), few studies have focused on long-term trends.

The most convincing evidence of ocean warming is for the
North Atlantic. An almost constant rate of interior warming, with
implied  steric  sea  level  rise, is  found  over  73  years  at  Ocean
Station S (south-east of Bermuda). Comparisons of trans-ocean
sections show that these changes are widespread (Table 11.1). On
decadal  time-scales, variations  in  surface  steric  height  from
station S compare well with sea level at Bermuda (Roemmich,
1990) and appear to be driven by changes in the wind stress curl
(Sturges and Hong, 1995; Sturges et al., 1998). Variability in the
western North Atlantic (Curry et al., 1998) is related to changes
in convective activity in the Labrador Sea (Dickson et al., 1996).
Over the 20 years up to the early 1990s there has been a cooling
of  the  Labrador  Sea  Water  (as  in  the  Irminger  Sea, Read  and
Gould, 1992), and more recently in the western North Atlantic
(Koltermann  et  al., 1999).  For  the  South Atlantic, changes  are
more uncertain, particularly those early in the 20th century.

A  warming  of  the  Atlantic  layer  in  the  Arctic  Ocean  is
deduced  by  comparison  of  modern  oceanographic  sections
collected  on  board  ice-breakers  (e.g., Quadfasel  et  al., 1991;
Carmack  et  al., 1997;  Swift  et  al., 1997)  and  submarines  (e.g.
Morison et al., 1998; Steele and Boyd, 1998) with Russian Arctic
Ocean atlases compiled from decades of earlier data (Treshnikov,
1977; Gorshkov, 1983). It is not yet clear whether these changes
result  from  a  climate  trend  or, as  argued  by  Grotefendt  et  al.
(1998), from  decadal  variability.  The  published  studies  do  not
report  estimates  of  steric  sea  level  changes;  we  note  that  a
warming  of  1°C  over  the  central  200  m  of  the  Atlantic  layer
would result in a local rise of steric sea level of 10 to 20 mm. 

Observations  from  the  Pacific  and  Indian  Oceans  cover  a
relatively short period, so any changes seen may be a result of
decadal  variability.  Wong  (1999), Wong  et  al. (1999), Bindoff
and  McDougall  (1994)  and  Johnson  and  Orsi  (1997)  studied
changes  in  the  South  Pacific.  Bindoff  and  McDougall  (2000)
studied  changes  in  the  southern  Indian  Ocean.  These  authors

Changes in Sea Level

found changes in temperature and salinity in the upper hundreds of
metres of the ocean which are consistent with a model of surface
warming  and  freshening  in  the  formation  regions  of  the  water
masses and their subsequent subduction into the upper ocean. Such
basin-scale changes are not merely a result of vertical thermocline
heave, as might result from variability in surface winds.

In the only global analysis to date, Levitus et al. (2000) finds
the ocean has stored 20×1022 J of heat between 1955 and 1995
(an average of 0.5 Wm-2), with over half of this occurring in the
upper 300 m for a rate of warming of 0.7°C/century. The steric
sea level rise equivalent is 0.55 mm/yr, with maxima in the sub-
tropical  gyre  of  the  North  Atlantic  and  the  tropical  eastern
Pacific. 

In summary, while the evidence is still incomplete, there are
widespread indications of thermal expansion, particularly in the
sub-tropical  gyres, of  the  order  1 mm/yr  (Table  11.1).  The
evidence  is  most  convincing  for  the  North Atlantic  but  it  also
extends into the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The only area where
cooling has been observed is in the sub-polar gyre of the North
Atlantic and perhaps the North Pacific sub-polar gyre. 

11.2.1.2 Models of thermal expansion
A variety of ocean models have been employed for estimates of
ocean  thermal  expansion.  The  simplest  and  most  frequently

quoted  is  the  one-dimensional  (depth)  upwelling-diffusion
(UD)  model  (Hoffert  et  al., 1980;  Wigley  and  Raper, 1987,
1992, 1993; Schlesinger and Jiang, 1990; Raper et al., 1996),
which  represents  the  variation  of  temperature  with  depth.
Kattenberg  et  al. (1996)  demonstated  that  results  from  the
GFDL  AOGCM  could  be  reproduced  by  the  UD  model  of
Raper  et  al. (1996).  Using  this  model, the  best  estimate  of
thermal expansion from 1880 to 1990 was 43 mm (with a range
of  31  to  57  mm)  (Warrick  et  al., 1996).  Raper  and  Cubasch
(1996) and Raper et al. (2001) discuss ways in which the UD
model  requires  modification  to  reproduce  the  results  of  other
AOGCMs. The latter work shows that a UD model of the type
used  in  the  SAR  may  be  inadequate  to  represent  heat  uptake
into the deep ocean on the time-scale of centuries. De Wolde et
al. (1995, 1997) developed a two dimensional (latitude-depth,
zonally averaged) ocean model, with similar physics to the UD
model.  Their  best  estimate  of  ocean  thermal  expansion  in  a
model forced by observed sea surface temperatures over the last
100 years was 35 mm (with a range of 22 to 51 mm). Church et
al. (1991)  developed  a  subduction  model  in  which  heat  is
carried  into  the  ocean  interior  through  an  advective  process,
which they argued better represented the oceans with movement
of  water  along  density  surfaces  and  little  vertical  mixing.
Jackett et al. (2000) developed this model further and tuned it

by comparison with an AOGCM, obtaining an estimate of 50
mm of thermal expansion over the last 100 years. 

The  advantage  of  these  simple  models  is  that  they  require
less  computing  power  than AOGCMs  and  so  the  sensitivity  of
results  to  a  range  of  uncertainties  can  easily  be  examined.
However, the  simplifications  imply  that  important  processes
controlling the penetration of heat from the surface into the ocean
interior are not reproduced and they cannot provide information
on the regional distribution of sea level rise. The most satisfactory
way of estimating ocean thermal expansion is through the use of
AOGCMs (Chapter 8, Section 8.3) (Gregory, 1993; Cubasch et
al., 1994; Bryan, 1996; Jackett et al., 2000; Russell et al., 2000;
Gregory  and  Lowe, 2000).  Improvements  over  the  last  decade
relate particularly to the representation of the effect on mixing by
processes  which  operate  on  scales  too  small  to  be  resolved  in
global  models, but  which  may  have  an  important  influence  on
heat uptake (see Section 8.5.2.2.4). The geographical distribution
of sea level change due to density and circulation changes can be
obtained  from AOGCM  results  (various  methods  are  used;  see
Gregory  et  al., 2001). The  ability  of  AOGCMs  to  simulate
decadal  variability  in  the  ocean  interior  has  not  yet  been
demonstrated  adequately, partly  because  of  the  scarcity  of
observations of decadal variability in the ocean for testing these
models. This is not only an issue of evaluation of model perform-
ance; it is also relevant for deciding whether observed trends in

to thermal expansion during the 20th century from AOGCM experiments
with historical concentrations of greenhouse gases, including the direct
effect of sulphate aerosols. See Tables 8.1 and 9.1 for further details of
models  and  experiments.  The  rates  are  means  over  the  periods
indicated, while  a  quadratic  fit  is  used  to  obtain  the  acceleration,
assumed  constant.  Under  this  assumption, the  rates  apply  to  the
midpoints (1950 and 1975) of the periods. Since the midpoints are 25
years apart, the difference between the rates is 25 times the acceleration.
This  relation  is  not  exact  because  of  interannual  variability  and  non-
constant acceleration.

sea  level  and  interior  ocean  temperatures  represent  a  change
which is significantly larger than the natural internal variability of
the climate system. 

A number of model simulations of the 20th century (Table
9.1) have recently been completed using realistic greenhouse gas
and  aerosol  forcings.  Results  for  global  average  thermal
expansion  over  periods  during  the  20th  century  are  given  in
Figure  11.1  and  Table  11.2.  They  suggest  that  over  the  last
hundred years the average rate of sea level rise due to thermal
expansion was of the order of 0.3 to 0.7 mm/yr, a range which
encompasses  the  simple  model  estimates, rising  to  0.6  to  1.1
mm/yr in recent decades, similar to the observational estimates
(Section 11.2.1.1).

11.2.2 Glaciers and Ice Caps

Box 11.2: Mass balance terms for glaciers, ice caps and ice
sheets

A glacier, ice cap or ice sheet gains mass by accumulation of
snow  (snowfall  and  deposition  by  wind-drift), which  is
gradually  transformed  to  ice, and  loses  mass  (ablation)
mainly  by  melting  at  the  surface  or  base  with  subsequent
runoff or evaporation of the melt water. Some melt water may
refreeze within the snow instead of being lost, and some snow
may sublimate or be blown off the surface. Ice may also be
removed  by  discharge  into  a  floating  ice  shelf  or  glacier
tongue, from which it is lost by basal melting and calving of
icebergs.  Net  accumulation  occurs  at  higher  altitude, net
ablation at lower altitude; to compensate for net accumulation
and ablation, ice flows downhill by internal deformation of
the ice and sliding and bed deformation at the base. The rate
at which this occurs is mainly controlled by the surface slope,
the ice thickness, the effective ice viscosity, and basal thermal
and physical conditions. The mass balance for an individual
body of ice is usually expressed as the rate of change of the
equivalent volume of liquid water, in m3/yr; the mass balance
is  zero  for  a  steady  state.  Mass  balances  are  computed  for
both the whole year and individual seasons; the winter mass
balance mostly measures accumulation, the summer, surface
melting.  The  specific  mass  balance  is  the  mass  balance
averaged  over  the  surface  area, in  m/yr.  A  mass  balance
sensitivity is the derivative of the specific mass balance with
respect to a climate parameter which affects it. For instance,
a mass balance sensitivity to temperature is in m/yr/°C.

11.2.2.1 Mass balance studies
The water contained in glaciers and ice caps (excluding the ice
sheets of Antarctica and Greenland) is equivalent to about 0.5 m
of global sea level (Table 11.3). Glaciers and ice caps are rather
sensitive  to  climate  change;  rapid  changes  in  their  mass  are
possible, and are capable of producing an important contribution
to the rate of sea level rise. To evaluate this contribution, we need
to know the rate of change of total glacier mass. Unfortunately
sufficient  measurements  exist  to  determine  the  mass  balance
(see  Box  11.2  for  definition)  for  only  a  small  minority  of  the
world’s 105 glaciers.

d Assuming an oceanic area of 3.62 × 108 km2.

A possible approximate approach to this problem is to group
glaciers  into  climatic  regions, assuming  glaciers  in  the  same
region to have a similar specific mass balance. With this method,
we  need  to  know  only  the  specific  mass  balance  for  a  typical
glacier in each region (Kuhn  et  al., 1999) and the total glacier
area  of  the  region.  Multiplying  these  together  gives  the  rate  of
change  of  glacier  mass  in  the  region.  We  then  sum  over  all
regions.

In the past decade, estimates of the regional totals of area
and  volume  have  been  improved  by  the  application  of  high
resolution  remote  sensing  and, to  a  lesser  extent, by  radio-
echo-sounding. New glacier inventories have been published
for central Asia and the former Soviet Union (Dolgushin and
Osipova, 1989; Liu et al., 1992; Kuzmichenok, 1993; Shi et
al., 1994; Liu and Xie, 2000; Qin et al., 2000), New Zealand

1997; Kaser, 1999; 1995; Kaser et al., 1996; Rott et al., 1998),
and  new  estimates  made  for  glaciers  in  Antarctica  and
Greenland  apart  from  the  ice  sheets  (Weidick  and  Morris,
1996). 

By  contrast, specific  mass  balance  is  poorly  known.
Continuous  mass  balance  records  longer  than  20  years  exist
for about forty glaciers worldwide, and about 100 have records
of more than five years (Dyurgerov and Meier, 1997a). Very
few  have  both  winter  and  summer  balances;  these  data  are
critical  to  relating  glacier  change  to  climatic  elements
(Dyurgerov and Meier, 1999). Although mass balance is being
monitored  on  several  dozen  glaciers  worldwide, these  are
mostly small (<20 km2) and not representative of the size class
that  contains  the  majority  of  the  mass  (>100  km2).  The
geographical coverage is also seriously deficient; in particular,
we  are  lacking  information  on  the  most  important  maritime
glacier  areas.  Specific  mass  balance  exhibits  wide  variation
geographically and over time (Figure 11.2). While glaciers in
most parts of the world have had negative mass balance in the

past 20 years, glaciers in New Zealand (Chinn, 1999; Lamont
et al., 1999) and southern Scandinavia (Tvede and Laumann,
1997) have been advancing, presumably following changes in
the regional climate.

Estimates of the historical global glacier contribution to
sea level rise are shown in Table 11.4. Dyurgerov and Meier
(1997a) obtained their estimate by dividing a large sample of
measured  glaciers  into  seven  major  regions  and  finding  the
mass  balance  for  each  region, including  the  glaciers  around
the ice sheets. Their area-weighted average for 1961 to 1990
was equivalent to 0.25 ± 0.10 mm/yr of sea level rise. Cogley
and Adams  (1998)  estimated  a  lower  rate  for  1961  to  1990.
However, their  results  may  be  not  be  representative  of  the
global average because they do not make a correction for the
regional  biases  in  the  sample  of  well  investigated  glaciers
(Oerlemans, 1999). When evaluating data based on observed
mass  balance, one  should  note  a  worldwide  glacier  retreat

following  the  high  stand  of  the  middle  19th  century  and
subsequent small regional readvances around 1920 and 1980. 

11.2.2.2 Sensitivity to temperature change
A method of dealing with the lack of mass balance measurements
is to estimate the changes in mass balance as a function of climate,
using mass balance sensitivities (see Box 11.2 for definition) and
observed or modelled climate change for glacier covered regions.
Mass-balance  modelling  of  all  glaciers  individually  is  not
practical  because  no  detailed  description  exists  for  the  great
majority of them, and because local climate data are not available;
even  regional  climate  models  do  not  have  sufficient  resolution,
while  downscaling  methods  cannot  generally  be  used  because
local  climate  measurements  have  not  been  made  (see  Section
10.7). A number of authors have estimated past glacier net mass
loss  using  past  temperature  change  with  present  day  glacier
covered areas and mass balance sensitivities (Table 11.4). In this
report, we  project  future  mass  balance  changes  using  regional
mass  balance  sensitivities  which  take  account  of  regional  and
seasonal climatic information, instead of using the heuristic model
of Wigley and Raper (1995) employed by Warrick et al. (1996).
Meier  (1984)  intuitively  scaled  specific  mass  balance
according to mass balance amplitude (half the difference between
winter  and  summer  specific  mass  balance).  Braithwaite  and
Zhang  (1999)  demonstrated  a  dependence  of  mass  balance
sensitivity  on  mass  balance  amplitude.  Oerlemans  and  Fortuin
(1992)  derived  an  empirical  relationship  between  the  mass
balance  sensitivity  of  a  glacier  to  temperature  change  and  the
local  average  precipitation, which  is  the  principal  factor
determining  its  mass  turnover  rate.  Zuo  and  Oerlemans  (1997)
extended  this  idea  by  distinguishing  the  effects  of  temperature
changes  in  summer  and  outside  summer;  the  former  have  a
stronger influence on mass loss, in general. They made a calcula-
tion of glacier net mass loss since 1865. For 1961 to 1990, they
obtained a rate of 0.3 mm/yr of sea level rise (i.e., a total of 8 mm,
Oerlemans, 1999), very  similar  to  the  result  of  Dyurgerov  and

Meier  (1997b).  Gregory  and  Oerlemans  (1998)  applied  local
seasonal  temperature  changes  over  1860  to  1990  calculated  by
the HadCM2 AOGCM forced by changing greenhouse gases and
aerosols (HadCM2 GS in Table 9.1) to the glacier model of Zuo
and Oerlemans.

Zuo and Oerlemans (1997), Gregory and Oerlemans (1998)
and Van de Wal and Wild (2001) all stress that the global average
glacier  mass  balance  depends  markedly  on  the  regional  and
seasonal  distribution  of  temperature  change.  For  instance,
Gregory and Oerlemans (1998) find that projected future glacier
net  mass  loss  is  20%  greater  if  local  seasonal  variation  is
neglected, and 20% less if regional variation is not included. The
first difference arises because annual average temperature change
is greater than summer temperature change at high latitudes, but
the  mass  balance  sensitivity  is  greater  to  summer  change.  The
second is because the global average temperature change is less
than the change at high latitudes, where most glaciers are found
(Section 9.3.2).

Both  the  observations  of  mass  balance  and  the  estimates
based on temperature changes (Table 11.4) indicate a reduction
of mass of glaciers and ice caps in the recent past, giving a contri-
bution to global-average sea level of 0.2 to 0.4 mm/yr over the
last hundred years. 

11.2.2.3 Sensitivity to precipitation change
Precipitation  and  accumulation  changes  also  influence  glacier
mass balance, and may sometimes be dominant (e.g. Raper et al.,
1996). Generally, glaciers in maritime climates are more sensitive
to winter accumulation than to summer conditions (Kuhn, 1984).
AOGCM experiments suggest that global-average annual mean
precipitation will increase on average by 1 to 3%/°C under the
enhanced greenhouse effect (Figure 9.18). Glacier mass balance
modelling indicates that to compensate for the increased ablation
from a temperature rise of 1°C a precipitation increase of 20%
(Oerlemans, 1981)  or  35%  (Raper  et  al., 2000)  would  be
required.  Van  de  Wal  and  Wild  (2001)  find  that  the  effect  of

650

Changes in Sea Level

precipitation changes on calculated global-average glacier mass
changes in the 21st century is only 5% of the temperature effect.
Such results suggest that the evolution of the global glacier mass
is  controlled  principally  by  temperature  changes  rather  than
precipitation changes. Precipitation changes might be significant
in particular localities, especially where precipitation is affected
by  atmospheric  circulation  changes, as  seems  recently  to  have
been the case with southern Scandinavian glaciers (Oerlemans,
1999).

11.2.2.4 Evolution of area
The  above  calculations  all  neglect  the  change  of  area  that  will
accompany  loss  of  volume.  Hence  they  are  inaccurate  because
reduction  of  area  will  restrict  the  rate  of  melting.  A  detailed
computation  of  transient  response  with  dynamic  adjustment  to
decreasing  glacier  sizes  is  not  feasible  at  present, since  the
required  information  is  not  available  for  most  glaciers.
Oerlemans  et  al. (1998)  undertook  such  detailed  modelling  of
twelve individual glaciers and ice caps with an assumed rate of
temperature change for the next hundred years. They found that
neglecting the contraction of glacier area could lead to an overes-
timate of net mass loss of about 25% by 2100.

Dynamic adjustment of glaciers to a new climate occurs over
tens to hundreds of years (Jóhannesson et al., 1989), the time-
scale being proportional to the mean glacier thickness divided by
the specific mass balance at the terminus. Since both quantities
are  related  to  the  size  of  the  glacier, the  time-scale  is  not
necessarily longer for larger glaciers (Raper et al., 1996; Bahr et
al., 1998), but  it  tends  to  be  longer  for  glaciers  in  continental
climates with low mass turnover (Jóhannesson et al., 1989; Raper
et al., 2000). 

Meier  and  Bahr  (1996)  and  Bahr  et  al. (1997), following
previous workers, proposed that for a glacier or an ice sheet in a
steady state there may exist scaling relationships of the form V
∝ Ac between the volume V and area A, where c is a constant.
Such  relationships  seem  well  supported  by  the  increasing
sample  of  glacier  volumes  measured  by  radio-echo-sounding
and other techniques, despite the fact that climate change may be
occurring on time-scales similar to those of dynamic adjustment.
If one assumes that the volume-area relationship always holds,
one can use it to deduce the area as the volume decreases. This
idea can be extended to a glacier covered region if one knows the
distribution  of  total  glacier  area  among  individual  glaciers,
which  can  be  estimated  using  empirical  functions  (Meier  and
Bahr, 1996; Bahr, 1997). Using these methods, Van de Wal and
Wild (2001) found that contraction of area reduces the estimated
glacier net mass loss over the next 70 years by 15 to 20% (see
also Section 11.5.1.1).

11.2.3 Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets

Together, the present Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets contain
enough water to raise sea level by almost 70 m (Table 11.3), so
that only a small fractional change in their volume would have a
significant effect. The average annual solid precipitation falling
onto the ice sheets is equivalent to 6.5 mm of sea level, this input
being approximately balanced by loss from melting and iceberg

calving. The balance of these processes is not the same for the
two  ice  sheets, on  account  of  their  different  climatic  regimes.
Antarctic temperatures are so low that there is virtually no surface
runoff;  the  ice  sheet  mainly  loses  mass  by  ice  discharge  into
floating  ice  shelves, which  experience  melting  and  freezing  at
their underside and eventually break up to form icebergs. On the
other hand, summer temperatures on the Greenland ice sheet are
high  enough  to  cause  widespread  melting, which  accounts  for
about  half  of  the  ice  loss, the  remainder  being  discharged  as
icebergs or into small ice-shelves.

Changes in ice discharge generally involve response times of
the order of 102 to 104 years. The time-scales are determined by
isostasy, the  ratio  of  ice  thickness  to  yearly  mass  turnover,
processes  affecting  ice  viscosity, and  physical  and  thermal
processes at the bed. Hence it is likely that the ice sheets are still
adjusting to their past history, in particular the transition to inter-
glacial conditions. Their future contribution to sea level change
therefore has a component resulting from past climate changes as
well as one relating to present and future climate changes. 

For  the  21st  century, we  expect  that  surface  mass  balance
changes will dominate the volume response of both ice sheets. A
key question is whether ice-dynamical mechanisms could operate
which  would  enhance  ice  discharge  sufficiently  to  have  an
appreciable additional effect on sea level rise.

11.2.3.1 Mass balance studies
Traditionally, the state of balance of the polar ice sheets has been
assessed  by  estimating  the  individual  mass  balance  terms, and
making the budget. Only the mass balance of the ice sheet resting
on  bedrock  (the  grounded  ice  sheet)  needs  to  be  considered,
because changes in the ice shelves do not affect sea level as they
are already afloat. Recent mass balance estimates for Greenland
and Antarctica are shown in Tables 11.5 and 11.6. Most progress
since the SAR has been made in the assessment of accumulation,
where the major obstacle is poor coverage by  in  situ measure-
ments.  New  methods  have  made  use  of  atmospheric  moisture
convergence  analysis  based  on  meteorological  data, remotely
sensed  brightness  temperatures  of  dry  snow, and  GCMs  (see
references in the tables). Recent accumulation estimates display
a tendency for convergence towards a common value, suggesting
a remaining error of less than 10% for both ice sheets.

For Greenland (Table 11.5), runoff is an important term but
net ablation has only been measured directly at a few locations
and  therefore  has  to  be  calculated  from  models, which  have
considerable sensitivity to the surface elevation data set and the
parameters of the melt and refreezing methods used (Reeh and
Starzer, 1996; Van de Wal, 1996; Van de Wal and Ekholm, 1996;
Janssens and Huybrechts, 2000). Summing best estimates of the
various mass balance components for Greenland gives a balance
of –8.5 ± 10.2% of the input, or +0.12 ± 0.15 mm/yr of global sea
level change, not significantly different from zero.

During the last five years, some mass balance estimates have
been made for individual Greenland sectors. A detailed compar-
ison of the ice flux across the 2,000 m contour with total accumu-
lation  revealed  most  of  the  accumulation  zone  to  be  near  to
equilibrium, albeit  with  somewhat  larger  positive  and  negative
local imbalances (Thomas et al., 1998, 2000). These results are

Changes in Sea Level

likely  to  be  only  little  influenced  by  short-term  variations,
because in the ice sheet interior, quantities that determine ice flow
show little variation on a century time-scale. Recent studies have
suggested a loss of mass in the ablation zone (Rignot et al., 1997;
Ohmura et al., 1999), and have brought to light the important role
played  by  bottom  melting  below  floating  glaciers  (Reeh  et  al.,
1997, 1999;  Rignot  et  al., 1997);  neglect  of  this  term  led  to
erroneous results in earlier analyses.

For Antarctica (Table 11.6), the ice discharge dominates the
uncertainty  in  the  mass  balance  of  the  grounded  ice  sheet,
because  of  the  difficulty  of  determining  the  position  and
thickness of ice at the grounding line and the need for assump-
tions  about  the  vertical  distribution  of  velocity.  The  figure  of
Budd and Smith (1985) of 1,620×1012 kg/yr is the only available
estimate.  Comparing  this  with  an  average  value  of  recent
accumulation estimates for the grounded ice sheet would suggest
a  positive  mass  balance  of  around  +10%  of  the  total  input,
equivalent  to  −0.5  mm/yr  of  sea  level.  Alternatively, the  flux
across the grounding line can be obtained by assuming the ice
shelves to be in balance and using estimates of the calving rate
(production of icebergs), the rate of melting on the (submerged)
underside of the ice shelves, and accumulation on the ice shelves.
This  results  in  a  flux  of  2,209  ±  391×1012 kg/yr  across  the
grounding line and a mass balance for the grounded ice equiva-
lent to +1.04 ± 1.06 mm/yr of sea level (Table 11.6). However,
the ice shelves may not be in balance, so that the error estimate
probably understates the true uncertainty.

11.2.3.2 Direct monitoring of surface elevation changes
Provided  that  changes  in  ice  and  snow  density  and  bedrock
elevation are small or can be determined, elevation changes can
be  used  to  estimate  changes  of  mass  of  the  ice  sheets.  Using
satellite altimetry, Davis  et  al. (1998) reported a small average
thickening  between  1978  and  1988  of  15  ±  20  mm/yr  of  the
Greenland  ice  sheet  above  2,000  m  at  latitudes  up  to  72°N.
Krabill  et  al. (1999)  observed  a  similar  pattern  above  2,000  m
from 1993 to 1998 using satellite referenced, repeat aircraft laser
altimetry.  Together, these  results  indicate  that  this  area  of  the
Greenland ice sheet has been nearly in balance for two decades,
in  agreement  with  the  mass  budget  studies  mentioned  above
(Thomas et al., 2000). Krabill et al. (1999) observed markedly
different  behaviour  at  lower  altitudes, with  thinning  rates  in
excess of 2 m/yr in the south and east, which they attributed in
part  to  excess  flow, although  a  series  of  warmer-than-average
summers  may  also  have  had  an  influence.  In  a  recent  update,
Krabill  et  al. (2000)  find  the  total  ice  sheet  balance  to  be
–46×1012 kg/yr or 0.13 mm/yr of sea level rise between 1993 and
1999, but could not provide an error bar. Incidentally, this value
is very close to the century time-scale imbalance derived from the
mass budget studies (Table 11.5), although the time periods are
different and the laser altimetry results do not allow us to distin-
guish between accumulation, ablation, and discharge.

Small changes of ± 11 mm/yr were reported by Lingle and
Covey  (1998)  in  a  region  of  East Antarctica  between  20° and
160°E  for  the  period  1978  to  1988.  Wingham  et  al. (1998)
examined  the  Antarctic  ice  sheet  north  of  82°S  from  1992  to
1996, excluding the marginal zone. They observed no change in

East Antarctica to within ± 5 mm/yr, but reported a negative trend
in West Antarctica of –53 ± 9 mm/yr, largely located in the Pine
Island  and Thwaites  Glacier  basins. They  estimated  a  century-
scale mass imbalance of −6% ± 8% of accumulation for 63% of
the  Antarctic  ice  sheet, concluding  that  the  thinning  in  West
Antarctica is likely to result from a recent accumulation deficit.
However, the measurements of Rignot (1998a), showing a 1.2 ±
0.3  km/yr  retreat  of  the  grounding  line  of  Pine  Island  Glacier
between 1992 and 1996, suggest an ice-dynamic explanation for
the observed thinning. Altimetry records are at present too short
to  confidently  distinguish  between  a  short-term  surface  mass-
balance  variation  and  the  longer-term  ice-sheet  dynamic
imbalance. Van der Veen and Bolzan (1999) suggest that at least
five years of data are needed on the central Greenland ice sheet. 

11.2.3.3 Numerical modelling
Modelling of the past history of the ice sheets and their underlying
beds  over  a  glacial  cycle  is  a  way  to  obtain  an  estimate  of  the
present ice-dynamic evolution unaffected by short-term (annual to
decadal)  mass-balance  effects.  The  simulation  requires  time-
dependent  boundary  conditions  (surface  mass  balance, surface
temperature, and  sea  level, the  latter  being  needed  to  model
grounding-line  changes).  Current  glaciological  models  employ
grids of 20 to 40 km horizontal spacing with 10 to 30 vertical layers
and include ice shelves, basal sliding and bedrock adjustment.

Huybrechts  and  De  Wolde  (1999)  and  Huybrechts  and  Le
Meur (1999) carried out long integrations over two glacial cycles
using  3-D  models  of  Greenland  and  Antarctica, with  forcing
derived  from  the  Vostok  (Antarctica)  and  Greenland  Ice  Core
Project (GRIP) ice cores. The retreat history of the ice sheet along
a transect in central west Greenland in particular was found to be
in  good  agreement  with  a  succession  of  dated  moraines  (Van
Tatenhove et al., 1995), but similar validation elsewhere is limited
by  the  availability  of  well-dated  material.  Similar  experiments
were  conducted  as  part  of  the  European  Ice  Sheet  Modelling
Initiative (EISMINT) intercomparison exercise (Huybrechts et al.,
1998).  These  model  simulations  suggest  that  the  average
Greenland contribution to global sea level rise has been between
–0.1  and  0.0  mm/yr  in  the  last  500  years, while  the  Antarctic
contribution  has  been  positive.  Four  different Antarctic  models
yield  a  sea  level  contribution  of  between  +0.1  and  +0.5  mm/yr
averaged  over  the  last  500  years, mainly  due  to  incomplete
grounding-line  retreat  of  the  West  Antarctic  ice  sheet  (WAIS)
since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Figure 11.3). However,
substantial uncertainties remain, especially for the WAIS, where
small phase shifts in the input sea level time-series and inadequate
representation  of  ice-stream  dynamics  may  have  a  significant
effect  on  the  model  outcome.  Glacio-isostatic  modelling  of  the
solid  earth  beneath  the  Antarctic  ice  sheet  with  prescribed  ice
sheet evolution (James and Ivins, 1998) gave similar uplift rates as
those  presented  in  Huybrechts  and  Le  Meur  (1999), indicating
that the underlying ice sheet scenarios and bedrock models were
similar, but  observations  are  lacking  to  validate  the  generated
uplift rates. By contrast, Budd et al. (1998) find that Antarctic ice
volume is currently increasing at a rate of about 0.08 mm/yr of sea
level lowering because in their modelling the Antarctic ice sheet
was actually smaller during the LGM than today (for which there

is, however, little  independent  evidence)  and  the  effect  of  the
higher accumulation rates during the Holocene dominates over the
effects of grounding line changes. 

Model  simulations  of  this  kind  have  not  included  the
possible  effects  of  changes  in  climate  during  the  20th  century.
The simulations described later (Section 11.5.1.1), in which an
ice sheet model is integrated using changes in temperature and
precipitation  derived  from  AOGCM  simulations, suggest  that
anthropogenic climate change could have produced an additional
contribution  of  between  –0.2  to  0.0  mm/yr  of  sea  level  from
increased accumulation in Antarctica over the last 100 years, and
between 0.0 and 0.1 mm/yr from Greenland, from both increased
accumulation  and  ablation.  The  model  results  for  Greenland
exhibit substantial interannual variability. Furthermore, because
of rising temperatures during the 20th century, the contribution
for  recent  decades  is  larger  than  the  average  for  the  century.
These points must be borne in mind when comparing with results
of  the  direct  observation  methods  for  short  periods  in  recent
decades  (Sections  11.2.3.1  and  11.2.3.2).  Note  also  that  the
observational results include the ongoing response to past climate
change as well as the effect of 20th century climate change.

11.2.3.4 Sensitivity to climatic change
The sensitivity of the ice sheet’s surface mass balance has been
studied with multiple regression analyses, simple meteorolog-
ical models, and GCMs (Table 11.7). Most progress since the
SAR has been made with several coupled AOGCMs, especially
in  the  “time-slice” mode  in  which  a  high-resolution  AGCM
(Atmospheric General Circulation Model) is driven by output
from  a  low-resolution  transient  AOGCM  experiment  for  a
limited duration of time. Model resolution of typically 100 km
allows  for  a  more  realistic  topography  crucial  to  better

resolving  temperature  gradients  and  orographic  forcing  of
precipitation  along  the  steep  margins  of  the  polar  ice  sheets.
Even  then, GCMs  do  not  yet  perform  well  in  reproducing
melting  directly  from  the  surface  energy  fluxes.  The  ablation
zone  around  the  Greenland  ice  sheet  is  mostly  narrower  than
100 km, and the important role played by topography therefore
requires the use of downscaling techniques to transfer informa-
tion to local and even finer grids (Glover, 1999). An additional
complication is that not all melt water runs off to the ocean and
can be partly retained on or in the ice sheet (Pfeffer et al., 1991;
Janssens and Huybrechts, 2000). 

For  Greenland, estimates  of  the  sensitivity  to  a  1°C  local
warming over the ice sheet are close to 0.3 mm/yr (with a total
range of +0.1 to +0.4 mm/yr) of global sea level equivalent. This
range  mainly  reflects  differences  in  the  predicted  precipitation
changes and the yearly distribution of the temperature increase,
which is predicted to be larger in winter than in summer in the
GCMs, but  is  assumed  uniform  in  the  studies  of  Van  de  Wal
(1996) and Janssens and Huybrechts (2000). Another difference
amongst the GCM results concerns the time window over which
the  sensitivities  are  assessed.  The  CSIRO9/T63  sensivities  are
estimated from high-resolution runs forced with observed SSTs
for the recent past (Smith et al., 1998; Smith, 1999), whereas the
ECHAM  data  are  given  as  specific  mass  balance  changes  for
doubled minus present atmospheric CO2. Thompson and Pollard
(1997)  report  similar  results  to  the  ECHAM  studies  but  the
corresponding sensitivity value could not be calculated because
the  associated  temperature  information  is  not  provided.  Some
palaeoclimatic  data  from  central  Greenland  ice  cores  indicate
that variations in precipitation during the Holocene are related to
changes in atmospheric circulation rather than directly to local
temperature (Kapsner et al., 1995; Cuffey and Clow, 1997), such
that  precipitation  might  not  increase  with  temperature  (in
contrast with Clausen et al., 1988). For glacial-interglacial transi-
tions, the  ice  cores  do  exhibit  a  strong  positive  correlation
between temperature and precipitation (Dansgaard et al., 1993;
Dahl-Jensen  et  al., 1993;  Kapsner  et  al., 1995;  Cuffey  and
Marshall, 2000), as  simulated  by AOGCMs  for  anthropogenic
warming.  Although  other  changes  took  place  at  the  glacial-
interglacial transition, this large climate shift could be argued to
be a better analogue for anthropogenic climate change than the
smaller  fluctuations  of  the  Holocene.  To  allow  for  changes  in
circulation patterns and associated temperature and precipitation
patterns, we have used time-dependent AOGCM experiments to
calculate the Greenland contribution (Section 11.5.1).

For  Antarctica, mass-balance  sensitivities  for  a  1°C  local
warming  are  close  to  –0.4  mm/yr  (with  one  outlier  of  –0.8
mm/yr) of global sea level equivalent. A common feature of all
methods  is  the  insignificant  role  of  melting, even  for  summer
temperature increases of a few degrees, so that only accumulation
changes need to be considered. The sensitivity for the case that
the  change  in  accumulation  is  set  proportional  to  the  relative
change in saturation vapour pressure is at the lower end of the
sensitivity range, suggesting that in a warmer climate changes in
atmospheric  circulation  and  increased  moisture  advection  can
become  equally  important, in  particular  close  to  the  ice  sheet
margin  (Bromwich, 1995;  Steig, 1997).  Both  ECHAM3  and

In  summary, the  static  sensitivity  values  suggest  a  larger
role  for  Antarctica  than  for  Greenland  for  an  identical  local
temperature  increase, meaning  that  the  polar  ice  sheets
combined would produce a sea level lowering, but the spread of
the  individual  estimates  includes  the  possibility  that  both  ice
sheets  may  also  balance  one  another  for  doubled  atmospheric
CO2 conditions  (Ohmura  et  al., 1996;  Thompson  and  Pollard,
1997).  For  CO2  increasing  according  to  the  IS92a  scenario
(without aerosol), studies by Van de Wal and Oerlemans (1997)
and  Huybrechts  and  De  Wolde  (1999)  calculated  sea  level
contributions  for  1990  to  2100  of  +80  to  +100  mm  from  the
Greenland ice sheet and about –80 mm from the Antarctic ice
sheet.  On  this  hundred  year  time-scale, ice-dynamics  on  the
Greenland ice sheet was found to counteract the mass-balance-
only effect by between 10 and 20%. Changes in both the area-
elevation  distribution  and  iceberg  discharge  played  a  role,
although the physics controlling the latter are poorly known and
therefore  not  well  represented  in  the  models.  Because  of  its
longer  response  time-scales, the  Antarctic  ice  sheet  hardly
exhibits any dynamic response on a century time-scale, except
when melting rates below the ice shelves were prescribed to rise
by in excess of 1 m/yr (O’Farrell et al., 1997; Warner and Budd,
1998;  Huybrechts  and  De  Wolde, 1999;  see  also  Section
11.5.4.3).

11.2.4 Interaction of Ice Sheets, Sea Level and the Solid 

Earth

11.2.4.1 Eustasy, isostasy and glacial-interglacial cycles
On time-scales of 103 to 105 years, the most important processes
affecting sea level are those associated with the growth and decay
of the ice sheets through glacial-interglacial cycles. These contri-
butions  include  the  effect  of  changes  in  ocean  volume  and  the
response of the earth to these changes. The latter are the glacio-
hydro-isostatic effects: the vertical land movements induced by
varying surface loads of ice and water and by the concomitant
redistribution of mass within the Earth and oceans. While major
melting of the ice sheets ceased by about 6,000 years ago, the
isostatic  movements  remain  and  will  continue  into  the  future
because  the  Earth’s  viscous  response  to  the  load  has  a  time-
constant of thousands of years. Observational evidence indicates
a complex spatial and temporal pattern of the resulting isostatic
sea  level  change  for  the  past  20,000  years.  As  the  geological
record  is  incomplete  for  most  parts  of  the  world, models
(constrained by the reliable sea level observations) are required to
describe and predict the vertical land movements and changes in
ocean  area  and  volume.  Relative  sea  level  changes  caused  by
lithospheric processes, associated for example with tectonics and
mantle convection, are discussed in Section 11.2.6. 

Figure 11.4 illustrates global-average sea level change over
the  last  140,000  years.  This  is  a  composite  record  based  on
oxygen  isotope  data  from  Shackleton  (1987)  and  Linsley

ships of Chappell et al. (1996a), the estimate of the LGM sea
level  by Yokoyama  et  al. (2000), the  late-glacial  eustatic  sea
level function of Fleming et al. (1998), and the timing of the
Last  Interglacial  by  Stirling  et  al. (1998).  These  fluctuations
demonstrate  the  occurrence  of  sea  level  oscillations  during  a
glacial-interglacial  cycle  that  exceed  100  m  in  magnitude  at
average rates of up to 10 mm/year and more during periods of
decay of the ice sheets and sometimes reaching rates as high as
40 mm/year  (Bard  et  al., 1996)  for  periods  of  very  rapid  ice
sheet decay. Current best estimates indicate that the total LGM
land-based  ice  volume  exceeded  present  ice  volume  by  50  to
53×106 km3 (Yokoyama et al., 2000).

Local  sea  level  changes  can  depart  significantly  from  this
average  signal  because  of  the  isostatic  effects.  Figure  11.5
illustrates typical observational results for sea level change since
the LGM in regions with no significant land movements other than
of a glacio-hydro-isostatic nature. Also shown are model predic-
tions for these localities, illustrating the importance of the isostatic
effects.  Geophysical  models  of  these  isostatic  effects  are  well
developed (see reviews by Lambeck and Johnston, 1998; Peltier,
1998). Recent modelling advances have been the development of
high-resolution  models  of  the  spatial  variability  of  the  change
including the detailed description of ice loads and of the melt-water
load distribution (Mitrovica and Peltier, 1991; Johnston, 1993) and
the examination of different assumptions about the physics of the
earth (Peltier and Jiang, 1996; Johnston et al., 1997; Kaufmann and
Wolf, 1999; Tromp and Mitrovica, 1999). 

Information about the changes in ice sheets come from field
observations, glaciological  modelling, and  from  the  sea  level
observations themselves. Much of the emphasis of recent work on
glacial rebound has focused on improved calculations of ice sheet
parameters  from  sea  level  data  (Peltier, 1998;  Johnston  and
Lambeck, 2000;  see  also  Section  11.3.1)  but  discrepancies
between  glaciologically-based  ice  sheet  models  and  models
inferred  from  rebound  data  remain, particularly  for  the  time  of,
and  before, the  LGM.  The  majority  of  ice  at  this  time  was
contained in the ice sheets of Laurentia and Fennoscandia but their
combined  estimated  volume  inferred  from  the  rebound  data  for
these regions (e.g., Nakada and Lambeck, 1988; Tushingham and
Peltier, 1991, 1992; Lambeck et al., 1998) is less than the total
volume required to explain the sea level change of about 120 to
125 m recorded at low latitude sites (Fairbanks, 1989; Yokoyama
et al., 2000). It is currently uncertain how the remainder of the ice
was  distributed.  For  instance, estimates  of  the  contribution  of
Antarctic ice to sea level rise since the time of the LGM range
from as much as 37 m (Nakada and Lambeck, 1988) to 6 to 13 m
(Bentley, 1999;  Huybrechts  and  Le  Meur, 1999).  Rebound
evidence from the coast of Antarctica indicates that ice volumes
have changed substantially since the LGM (Zwartz et al., 1997;
Bentley, 1999) but these observations, mostly extending back only
to 8,000 years ago, do not provide good constraints on the LGM
volumes. New evidence from exposure age dating of moraines and
rock  surfaces  is  beginning  to  provide  new  constraints  on  ice
thickness in Antarctica (e.g., Stone et al., 1998) but the evidence is
not yet sufficient to constrain past volumes of the entire ice sheet.

Changes in Sea Level

Figure 11.5: Examples of observed relative sea level change (with
error bars, right-hand side) and model predictions for four different
locations. The model predictions (left-hand side) are for the glacio-
hydro-eustatic contributions to the total change (solid line, right hand
side). (a) Angermann River, Sweden, near the centre of the former
ice sheet over Scandinavia. The principal contribution to the sea level
change is the crustal rebound from the ice unloading (curve marked
ice, left-hand side) and from the change in ocean volume due to the
melting of all Late Pleistocene ice sheets (curve marked esl). The
combined predicted effect, including a small water loading term (not
shown), is shown by the solid line (right-hand side), together with
the observed values. (b) A location near Stirling, Scotland. Here the
ice and esl contributions are of comparable magnitude but opposite
sign (left-hand side) such that the rate of change of the total contribu-
tion changes sign (right-hand side). This result is typical for locations
near former ice margins or from near the centres of small ice sheets.
(c) The south of England where the isostatic contributions from the
water (curve marked water) and ice loads are of similar amplitude
but opposite sign. The dominant contribution to sea level change is
now the eustatic contribution. This behaviour is characteristic of
localities that lie well beyond the ice margins where a peripheral
bulge created by the ice load is subsiding as mantle material flows
towards the region formerly beneath the ice. (d) A location in
Australia where the melt-water load is the dominant cause of
isostatic adjustment. Here sea level has been falling for the past
6,000 years. This result is characteristic of continental margin sites
far from the former areas of glaciation. (From Lambeck, 1996.)

11.2.4.2 Earth rotation constraints on recent sea level rise
Changes in the Earth’s ice sheets introduce a time-dependency
in the Earth’s inertia tensor whose consequences are observed
both in the planet’s rotation (as an acceleration in its rotation
rate and as a shift in the position of the rotation axis) and in the
acceleration  of  the  rotation  of  satellite  orbits  about  the  Earth
(Wu  and  Peltier, 1984;  Lambeck, 1988).  Model  estimates  of
these  changes  are  functions  of  mass  shifts  within  and  on  the
Earth  and  are  dependent, therefore, on  the  past  ice  sheet
geometries, on the Earth’s rheology, and on the recent past and
present  rates  of  melting  of  the  residual  ice  sheets.  Other
geophysical  processes  also  contribute  to  the  time-dependence

of  the  rotational  and  dynamical  parameters  (e.g.  Steinberger
and  O’Connell, 1997).  Hence, unique  estimates  of  recent
melting cannot be inferred from the observations. 

Some  constraints  on  the  present  rates  of  change  of  the  ice
sheets have, nevertheless, been obtained, in particular through a
combination  of  the  rotational  observations  with  geological  and
tide  gauge  estimates  of  sea  level  change  (Wahr  et  al., 1993;
Mitrovica and Milne, 1998; Peltier, 1998; Johnston and Lambeck,
1999). Results obtained so far are preliminary because observa-
tional records of the change in satellite orbits are relatively short
(Nerem  and  Klosko, 1996;  Cheng  et  al., 1997)  but  they  will
become  important  as  the  length  of  the  record  increases.  Peltier

Changes in Sea Level

657

(1998)  has  argued  that  if  the  polar  ice  sheets  contributed, for
example, 0.5 mm/yr to the global sea level rise, then the rotational
constraints would require that most of this melting derived from
Greenland.  Johnston  and  Lambeck  (1999)  concluded  that  a
solution consistent with geological evidence, including constraints
on sea level for the past 6,000 years (Section 11.3.1), is for a non-
steric sea level rise (i.e., not resulting from ocean density changes)
of  1.0  ±  0.5  mm/yr  for  the  past  100  years, with  5  to  30%
originating from Greenland melting. However, all such estimates
are based on a number of still uncertain assumptions such that the
inferences are more indicative of the potential of the methodology
than of actual quantitative conclusions.

11.2.5 Surface and Ground Water Storage and Permafrost

An  important  contribution  to  present  day  sea  level  rise  could
result from changes in the amount of water stored in the ground,
on  the  surface  in  lakes  and  reservoirs, and  by  modifications  to
surface  characteristics  affecting  runoff  or  evapotranspiration
rates. Changing practices in the use of land and water could make
these  terms  larger  in  future.  However, very  little  quantitative
information  is  available.  For  some  of  the  components  of  the
terrestrial water budget, Gornitz et al. (1997), updated by Gornitz
(2000), give net results which differ substantially from those of
Sahagian (2000) and Vörösmarty and Sahagian (2000), and also
from  those  of  Sahagian  et  al. (1994)  used  by  Warrick  et  al.
(1996).  The largest positive contribution to sea level probably
comes from ground water mining, which means the extraction of
ground  water  from  storage  in  aquifers  in  excess  of  the  rate  of
natural recharge. Gornitz et al. (1997) estimate that ground water
is  mined  at  a  rate  that  has  been  increasing  in  time, currently
equivalent to 0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr of sea level, but they assume that
much of this infiltrates back into aquifers so the contribution to
sea level rise is only 0.1 to 0.4 mm/yr. Sahagian (2000) considers
fewer  aquifers;  consequently  he  obtains  a  smaller  total  of  0.17
mm/yr from mining, but assumes that all of this water eventually
reaches the ocean through the atmosphere or runoff. If Sahagian’s
assumption  were  applied  to  the  inventory  of  Gornitz  et  al. it
would imply a sea level contribution of 0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr.

Volumes  of  many  of  the  world’s  large  lakes  have  been
reduced in recent decades through increased irrigation and other
water use. Sahagian et al. (1994) and Sahagian (2000) estimate
that  the  reduced  volumes  of  the  Caspian  and  Aral  Seas  (and
associated  ground  water)  contribute  0.03  and  0.18  mm/year  to
sea level rise, on the assumption that the extracted water reaches
the world ocean by evapotranspiration. Recent in situ records and
satellite altimetry data indicate that substantial fluctuations in the
level  of  the  Caspian  Sea  can  occur  on  decadal  time-scales
(Cazenave et al., 1997) which suggests that short records may not
give a good indication of the long-term average. The reduction of
lake volumes in China may contribute a further 0.005 mm/yr (Shi
and Zhou, 1992). Assuming there are no other large sources, we
take 0.2 mm/yr as the upper limit of the present contribution to
sea level from lakes. Gornitz et al. (1997) do not include a term
from  lake  volume  changes, because  they  assume  the  water
extracted for irrigation largely enters the ground water rather than
the world ocean, so we take zero as the lower limit.

Gornitz et al. (1997) estimate there is 13.6 mm of sea level
equivalent impounded in reservoirs. Most of this capacity was
created, at roughly a constant rate, from 1950 to 1990. This rate
of  storage  represents  a  reduction  in  sea  level  of  0.34 mm/yr.
They assume that annually 5 ± 0.5% of the water impounded
seeps into deep aquifers, giving a 1990 rate of seepage of 0.61
to 0.75 mm/yr, and a total volume of 15 mm sea level equiva-
lent. We consider that this represents an upper bound, because
it  is  likely  that  the  rate  of  seepage  from  any  reservoir  will
decrease  with  time  as  the  surrounding  water  table  rises, as
assumed by Sahagian (2000). On the basis of a typical porosity
and  area  affected, he  estimates  that  the  volume  trapped  as
ground  water  surrounding  reservoirs  is  1.2  times  the  volume
impounded  in  reservoirs.  His  estimate  of  the  storage  in
reservoirs is 14 to 28 mm sea level equivalent; hence the ground
water storage is an additional 17 to 34 mm sea level equivalent.
Lack of global inventories means that these estimates of storage
may well be too small because of the many small reservoirs not
taken  into  account  (rice  paddies, ponds, etc., provided  they
impound  water  above  the  water  table)  (Vörösmarty  and
Sahagian, 2000).  The  total  stored  could  be  up  to  50%  larger
(Sahagian, 2000).

Gornitz  et  al. (1997)  estimate  that  evapotranspiration  of
water  from  irrigated  land  leads  to  an  increase  in  atmospheric
water  content  and  hence  a  fall  in  sea  level  of  0.14  to  0.15
mm/yr.  We  consider  this  to  be  an  overestimate, because  it
implies  a  20th  century  increase  in  global  tropospheric  water
content  which  substantially  exceeds  observations  (Section
2.5.3.2). They further suggest that irrigation water derived from
surface  sources  may  infiltrate  into  aquifers, removing  0.40  to
0.48 mm/yr of sea level equivalent, based on the same assump-
tion  as  for  seepage  from  reservoirs.  Urbanisation  leads  to
reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff, which Gornitz
et al. (1997) estimate may contribute 0.35 to 0.41 mm/yr of sea
level  rise.  We  consider  these  two  terms  to  be  upper  bounds
because, as with infiltration from reservoirs, a new steady state
will be achieved after a period of years, with no further change
in storage.

Estimates of the water contributed by deforestation are 0.1
mm/yr (Gornitz et al., 1997) and 0.14 mm/yr (Sahagian, 2000)
of  sea  level  rise.  Water  released  by  oxidation  of  fossil  fuels,
vegetation and wetlands loss is negligible (Gornitz et al., 1997).
Gornitz et al. (1997) estimate the total contribution to the
1990 rate of sea level change as –1.2 to –0.5 mm/yr. Integrating
their  estimates  over  1910  to  1990  gives  between  –32 and
–11 mm  of  sea  level  rise.  In  contrast, the  estimate  of
Vörösmarty  and  Sahagian  (2000)  for  the  rate  of  sea  level
change from terrestrial storage is 0.06 mm/yr, equivalent to 5.4
mm  over  80  years.  The  estimate  of  Sahagian  et  al. (1994),
quoted  by Warrick  et  al. (1996), was  12 mm  during  the  20th
century.  These  discrepancies  emphasise  again  the  unsatisfac-
tory knowledge of these contributions to sea level change.

Table  11.8  shows  the  ranges  we  have  adopted  for  the
various terms, based on the foregoing discussion. We integrate
these  terms  over  1910  to  1990.  (We  use  the  time  profiles  of
Gornitz et al. (1997) except that the infiltration from reservoirs
is  based  on  the  approach  of  Sahagian  (2000), and  the  rate  of

withdrawal  from  lakes  is  assumed  constant  over  the  last  five
decades.)  This  gives  a  range  of  –83  to  +30  mm  of  sea  level
equivalent, or  –1.1  to  +0.4  mm/yr  averaged  over  the  period.
However note that the rate of each of the terms increases during
the 20th century. 

This  discussion  suggests  three  important  conclusions: (i)
the  effect  of  changes  in  terrestrial  water  storage  on  sea  level
may be considerable; (ii) the net effect on sea level could be of
either  sign, and  (iii)  the  rate  has  increased  over  the  last  few
decades (in the assessment of Gornitz et al. (1997) from near
zero at the start of the century to –0.8 mm/yr in 1990). 

Estimates of ice volume in northern hemisphere permafrost
range from 1.1 to 3.7×1013 m3 (Zhang et al., 1999), equivalent
to 0.03 to 0.10 m of global-average sea level. It occupies 25%
of land area in the northern hemisphere. The major effects of
global  warming  in  presently  unglaciated  cold  regions  will  be
changes in the area of permafrost and a thickening of the active
layer (the layer of seasonally thawed ground above permafrost).
Both of these factors result in conversion of ground ice to liquid
water, and hence in principle could contribute to the sea level
change.  Anisimov  and  Nelson  (1997)  estimated  that  a  10  to
20% reduction of area could occur by 2050 under a moderate
climate-change  scenario.  In  the  absence  of  information  about
the vertical distribution of the ice, we make the assumption that
the volume change is proportional to the area change. By 2100,
the upper limit for the conversion of permafrost to soil water is
thus about 50% of the total, or 50 mm sea level equivalent.

A  thickening  active  layer  will  result  in  additional  water
storage capacity in the soil and thawing of ground ice will not
necessarily  make  water  available  for  runoff.  What  water  is
released could be mainly captured in ponds, thermokarst lakes,
and marshes, rather than running off. Since the soil moisture in
permafrost  regions  in  the  warm  period  is  already  very  high,
evaporation  would  not  necessarily  increase.  We  know  of  no
quantitative estimates for these storage terms. We assume that
the  fraction  which  runs  off  lies  within  0  and  50%  of  the
available  water.  Hence  we  estimate  the  contribution  of

permafrost to sea level 1990 to 2100 as 0 to 25 mm (0 to 0.23
mm/yr).  For  the  20th  century, during  which  the  temperature
change  has  been  about  five  times  less  than  assumed  by
Anisimov and Nelson for the next hundred years, our estimate
is 0 to 5 mm (0 to 0.05 mm/yr).

11.2.6 Tectonic Land Movements

We  define  tectonic  land  movement  as  that  part  of  the  vertical
displacement  of  the  crust  that  is  of  non-glacio-hydro-isostatic
origin. It includes rapid displacements associated with earthquake
events and also slow movements within (e.g., mantle convection)
and on (e.g., sediment transport) the Earth. Large parts of the earth
are subject to active tectonics which continue to shape the planet’s
surface.  Where  the  tectonics  occur  in  coastal  areas, one  of  its
consequences is the changing relationship between the land and
sea  surfaces  as  shorelines  retreat  or  advance  in  response  to  the
vertical land movements. Examples include the Huon Peninsula
of  Papua  New  Guinea  (Chappell  et  al., 1996b), parts  of  the
Mediterranean (e.g. Pirazzoli et al., 1994; Antonioli and Oliverio,
1996), Japan  (Ota  et  al., 1992)  and  New  Zealand  (Ota  et  al.,
1995). The Huon Peninsula provides a particularly good example
(Figure 11.6) with 125,000 year old coral terraces at up to 400 m
above  present  sea  level.  The  intermediate  terraces  illustrated  in
Figure 11.6 formed at times when the tectonic uplift rates and sea
level  rise  were  about  equal.  Detailed  analyses  of  these  reef
sequences have indicated that long-term average uplift rates vary
between  about  2  and  4  mm/yr, but  that  large  episodic  (and
unpredictable) displacements of 1 m or more occur at repeat times
of  about  1,000  years  (Chappell  et  al., 1996b).  Comparable
average rates and episodic displacements have been inferred from
Greek shoreline evidence (Stiros et al., 1994). With major tectonic
activity occurring at the plate boundaries, which in many instances
are also continental or island margins, many of the world’s tide
gauge  records  are  likely  to  contain  both  tectonic  and  eustatic
signals. One value of the geological data is that it permits evalua-
tions to be made of tectonic stability of the tide gauge locality. 

Changes in Sea Level

regions  of  the  high Arctic  and  equatorial  Pacific. As  found  by
Woodworth (1987), trends are only of the order of 0.01 hPa/yr in
northern Europe, where most of the longest historical tide gauges
are  located. We  conclude  that  long-term  sea  level  trends  could
have been modified to the extent of ± 0.2 mm/yr, considerably
less than the average eustatic rate of rise. Over a shorter period
larger trends can be found. For example, Schönwiese et al. (1994)
and  Schönwiese  and  Rapp  (1997)  report  changes  in  surface
pressure for the period 1960 to 1990 that could have modified sea
level  trends  in  the  Mediterranean  and  around  Scandinavia  by
–0.05 and +0.04 mm/yr respectively. 

11.3 Past Sea Level Changes

11.3.1 Global Average Sea Level over the Last 6,000 Years

The  geological  evidence  for  the  past  10,000  to  20,000  years
indicates  that  major  temporal  and  spatial  variation  occurs  in
relative sea level change (e.g., Pirazzoli, 1991) on time-scales of
the  order  of  a  few  thousand  years  (Figure  11.5).  The  change
observed  at  locations  near  the  former  centres  of  glaciation  is
primarily  the  result  of  the  glacio-isostatic  effect, whereas  the
change  observed  at  tectonically  stable  localities  far  from  the
former ice sheets approximate the global average sea level change
(for  geologically  recent  times  this  is  primarily  eustatic  change
relating  to  changes  in  land-based  ice  volume).  Glacio-hydro-
isostatic effects (the Earth’s response to the past changes in ice and
water loads) remain important and result in a spatial variability in
sea level over the past 6,000 years for localities far from the former
ice  margins.  Analysis  of  data  from  such  sites  indicate  that  the
ocean volume may have increased to add 2.5 to 3.5 m to global
average sea level over the past 6,000 years (e.g., Fleming et al.,
1998), with  a  decreasing  contribution  in  the  last  few  thousand
years. If this occurred uniformly over the past 6,000 years it would
raise sea level by 0.4 to 0.6 mm/year. However, a few high resolu-
tion  sea  level  records  from  the  French  Mediterranean  coast
indicate that much of this increase occurred between about 6,000
and 3,000 years ago and that the rate over the past 3,000 years was
only about 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr (Lambeck and Bard, 2000). These
inferences do not constrain the source of the added water but likely
sources are the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets with possible
contributions from glaciers and thermal expansion. 

In these analyses of Late Holocene observations, the relative
sea  level  change  is  attributed  to  both  a  contribution  from  any
change in ocean volume and a contribution from the glacio-hydro-
isostatic effect, where the former is a function of time only and the
latter is a function of both time and position. It is possible to use
the record of sea level changes to estimate parameters for a model
of  isostatic  rebound.  In  doing  this, the  spatial  variability  of  sea
level  change  determines  the  mantle  rheology, whereas  the  time
dependence determines any correction that may be required to the
assumed  history  of  volume  change.  Solutions  from  different
geographic regions may lead to variations in the rheology due to
lateral  variations  in  mantle  temperature, for  example, but  the
eustatic term should be the same, within observational and model
uncertainties, in each case (Nakada and Lambeck, 1988). If it is
assumed  that  no  eustatic  change  has  occurred  in  the  past  6,000

Figure 11.6: The raised 125,000 year old coral terraces of the Huon
Peninsula of Papua New Guinea up to 400 m above present sea level
(Chappell et al., 1996b).

Over very long time-scales (greater than 106 years), mantle
dynamic processes lead to changes in the shape and volume of
the  ocean  basins, while  deposition  of  sediment  reduces  basin
volume. These affect sea level but at very low rates (less than
0.01 mm/yr and 0.05 mm/yr, respectively; e.g., Open University,
1989; Harrison, 1990).

Coastal  subsidence  in  river  delta  regions  can  be  an
important contributing factor to sea level change, with a typical
magnitude of 10 mm/yr, although the phenomenon will usually
be  of  a  local  character.  Regions  of  documented  subsidence
include  the  Mediterranean  deltas  (Stanley, 1997), the
Mississippi delta (Day et al., 1993) and the Asian deltas. In the
South China Sea, for example, the LGM shoreline is reported to
occur at a depth of about 165 m below present level (Wang et
al., 1990), suggesting that some 40 m of subsidence may have
occurred in 20,000 years at an average rate of about 2 mm/yr.
Changes  in  relative  sea  level  also  arise  through  accretion  and
erosion  along  the  coast;  again, such  effects  may  be  locally
significant. 

11.2.7 Atmospheric Pressure

Through the inverse barometer effect, a local increase in surface
air  pressure  over  the  ocean  produces  a  depression  in  the  sea
surface of 1 cm per hPa (1 hPa = 1 mbar). Since water is practi-
cally  incompressible, this  cannot  lead  to  a  global-average  sea
level rise, but a long-term trend in surface air pressure patterns
could  influence  observed  local  sea  level  trends.  This  has  been
investigated  using  two  data  sets: (i)  monthly  mean  values  of
surface air pressure on a 10°×5° grid for the period 1873 to 1995
for  the  Northern  Hemisphere  north  of  15°N  obtained  from  the
University  of  East  Anglia  Climatic  Research  Unit, and  (ii)
monthly mean values on a global 5°×5° grid for the period 1871
to  1994  obtained  from  the  UK  Met  Office  (see  Basnett  and
Parker, 1997, for a discussion of the various data sets). The two
data  sets  present  similar  spatial  pattens  of  trends  for  their
geographical and temporal overlaps. Both yield small trends of
the  order  0.02  hPa/yr;  values  of  –0.03  hPa/yr  occur  in  limited

660

Changes in Sea Level

years or so, but in fact eustatic change actually has occurred, the
solution  for  Earth-model  parameters  will  require  a  somewhat
stiffer mantle than a solution in which eustatic change is included.
The  two  solutions  may, however, be  equally  satisfactory  for
interpolating between observations. For example, both approaches
lead to mid-Holocene highstands at island and continental margin
sites far from the former ice sheets of amplitudes 1 to 3 m. The
occurrence of such sea level maxima places a upper limit on the
magnitude of glacial melt in recent millennia (e.g., Peltier, 2000),
but  it  would  be  inconsistent  to  combine  estimates  of  ongoing
glacial  melt  with  results  of  calculations  of  isostatic  rebound  in
which  the  rheological  parameters  have  been  inferred  assuming
there is no ongoing melt.

The geological indicators of past sea level are usually not
sufficiently  precise  to  enable  fluctuations  of  sub-metre
amplitude to be observed. In some circumstances high quality
records do exist. These are from tectonically stable areas where
the tidal range is small and has remained little changed through
time, where no barriers or other shoreline features formed to
change  the  local  conditions, and  where  there  are  biological
indicators that bear a precise and consistent relationship to sea
level.  Such  areas  include  the  micro-atoll  coral  formations  of
Queensland, Australia  (Chappell, 1982;  Woodroffe  and
McLean, 1990);  the  coralline  algae  and  gastropod  vermetid
data of the Mediterranean (Laborel et al., 1994; Morhange et

al., 1996), and the fresh-to-marine transitions in the Baltic Sea
(Eronen  et  al., 1995;  Hyvarinen, 1999).  These  results  all
indicate  that  for  the  past  3,000  to  5,000  years  oscillations  in
global  sea  level  on  time-scales  of  100  to  1,000  years  are
unlikely  to  have  exceeded  0.3  to  0.5  m.  Archaeological
evidence for this interval places similar constraints on sea level
oscillations (Flemming and Webb, 1986). Some detailed local
studies have indicated that fluctuations of the order of 1 m can
occur  (e.g., Van  de  Plassche  et  al., 1998)  but  no  globally
consistent pattern has yet emerged, suggesting that these may
be local rather than global variations.

Estimates  of  current  ice  sheet  mass  balance  (Section
11.2.3.1) have improved since the SAR. However, these results
indicate only that the ice sheets are not far from balance. Earth
rotational constraints (Section 11.2.4.2) and ice sheet altimetry
(Section 11.2.3.2) offer the prospect of resolving the ice sheet
mass  balance  in  the  future, but  at  present  the  most  accurate
estimates  of  the  long-term  imbalance  (period  of  several
hundred years) follows from the comparison of the geological
sea  level  data  with  the  ice  sheet  modelling  results  (Section
11.2.3.3).  The  above  geological  estimates  of  the  recent  sea
level rates may include a component from thermal expansion
and glacier mass changes which, from the long-term tempera-
ture record in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3.2), could contribute to a
sea  level  lowering  by  as  much  as  0.1  mm/yr.  These  results

to correct for vertical land movement (VLM).

gauge trends and took the the zero-degree term as the global-average rate. They indicated that a PGR signal would make little contribution to

suggest that the combined long-term ice sheet imbalance lies
within  the  range  0.1  to  0.3  mm/yr.  Results  from  ice  sheet
models for the last 500 years indicate an ongoing adjustment to
the glacial-interglacial transition of Greenland and Antarctica
together of 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr. These ranges are consistent. We
therefore take the ongoing contribution of the ice sheets to sea
level rise in the 20th and 21st centuries in response to earlier
climate change as 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr. This is additional to the
effect of 20th century and future climate change. 

11.3.2 Mean Sea Level Changes over the Past 100 to 200 Years

11.3.2.1 Mean sea level trends
The primary source of information on secular trends in global
sea level during the past century is the tide gauge data set of the
Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (Spencer and
Woodworth, 1993). The tide gauge measurement is of the level
of  the  sea  surface  relative  to  that  of  the  land  upon  which  the
gauge is located and contains information on both the displace-
ment  of  the  land  and  on  changes  in  ocean  volume  (eustatic
changes).  The  land  displacement  may  be  of  two  types: that
caused by active tectonics and that caused by glacial rebound.
Corrections for these effects are required if the change in ocean
volume  is  to  be  extracted  from  the  tide  gauge  record.  Both
corrections  are  imperfectly  known  and  are  based  on  sea  level
observations themselves, usually from long geological records.
Different strategies have been developed for dealing with these
corrections but differences remain that are not inconsequential
(see Table 11.9). 

The  sea  level  records  contain  significant  interannual  and
decadal  variability  and  long  records  are  required  in  order  to
estimate reliable secular rates that will be representative of the
last  century.  In  addition, sea  level  change  is  spatially  variable
because of land movements and of changes in the ocean circula-
tion. Therefore, a good geographic distribution of observations is
required.  Neither  requirement  is  satisfied  with  the  current  tide
gauge  network  and  different  strategies  have  been  developed  to
take these differences into consideration. Warrick et al. (1996),
Douglas (1995) and Smith et al. (2000) give recent reviews of the
subject, including  discussions  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere
geographical bias in the historical data set.

In  the  absence  of  independent  measurements  of  vertical
land  movements  by  advanced  geodetic  techniques  (Section
11.6.1), corrections for movements are based on either geolog-
ical  data  or  geophysical  modelling.  The  former  method  uses
geological  evidence  from  locations  adjacent  to  the  gauges  to
estimate  the  long-term  relative  sea  level  change  which  is
assumed  to  be  caused  primarily  by  land  movements, from
whatever  cause. This  is  subtracted  from  the  gauge  records  to
estimate the eustatic change for the past century. However, this
procedure may underestimate the real current eustatic change
because the observed geological data may themselves contain a
long-term component of eustatic sea level rise (Section 11.3.1).
The  latter  method, glacial  rebound  modelling, is  also
constrained  by  geological  observations  to  estimate  earth
response functions or ice load parameters, which may therefore
themselves contain a component of long-term eustatic sea level

change  unless  this  component  is  specifically  solved  for
(Section 11.3.1).

A further underestimate of the rate of sea level rise from the
geological  approach, compared  to  that  from  glacial  rebound
models, will pertain in forebulge areas, and especially the North
American east coast, where the linear extrapolation of geological
data could result in an underestimate of the corrected rate of sea
level change for the past century typically by 0.3 mm/yr because
the  glacial  rebound  signal  is  diminishing  with  time  (Peltier,
2000). However, in areas remote from the former ice sheets this
bias will be considerably smaller. 

Also, in adding recent mass into the oceans, most studies
have  assumed  that  it  is  distributed  uniformly  and  have
neglected the Earth’s elastic and gravitational response to the
changed  water  loading  (analogous  to  glacio-hydro-isostatic
effect). This will have the effect of reducing the observed rise
at continental margin sites from ongoing mass contributions by
as much as 30% (cf. Nakiboglu and Lambeck, 1991). 

Table 11.9 summarises estimates of the corrected sea level
trends for the past century. Estimates cover a wide range as a
result of different assumptions and methods for calculating the
rate of vertical land movement, of different selections of gauge
records  for  analysis, and  of  different  requirements  for
minimum record length. 

There  have  been  several  more  studies  since  the  SAR  of
trends  observed  in  particular  regions. Woodworth  et  al. (1999)
provided  a  partial  update  to  Shennan  and  Woodworth  (1992),
suggesting that sea level change in the North Sea region has been
about  1  mm/yr  during  the  past  century.  Lambeck  et  al. (1998)
combined  coastal  tide  gauge  data  from  Fennoscandinavia
together with lake level records and postglacial rebound models
to estimate an average regional rise for the past century of 1.1 ±
0.2 mm/yr. Studies of the North American east coast have been
particularly  concerned  with  the  spatial  dependence  of  trends
associated  with  the  Laurentian  forebulge.  Peltier  (1996)
concluded a current rate of order 1.9 ± 0.6 mm/yr, larger than the
1.5 mm/yr obtained by Gornitz (1995), who used the geological
data approach, and Mitrovica and Davis (1995), who employed
Post Glacial Rebound (PGR) modelling. Note that the observa-
tions  of  thermal  expansion  (Section  11.2.1.1)  indicate  a  higher
rate of sea level rise over recent decades in the sub-tropical gyres
of the North Atlantic (i.e., off the North American east coast) than
the higher latitude sub-polar gyre. Thus the differences between
three  lower  European  values  compared  with  the  higher  North
American  values  may  reflect  a  real  regional  difference  (with
spatial  variations  in  regional  sea  level  change  being  perhaps
several tenths of a millimetre per year – see also Section 11.5.2).
In China, relative sea level is rising at about 2 mm/yr in the south
but less than 0.5 mm/yr in the north (National Bureau of Marine
Management, 1992), with  an  estimated  average  of  the  whole
coastline of 1.6 mm/yr (Zhen and Wu, 1993) and with attempts to
remove  the  spatially  dependent  component  of  vertical  land
movement yielding an average of 2.0 mm/yr (Shi, 1996). The two
longest  records  from  Australia  (both  in  excess  of  80  years  in
length and not included in Douglas, 1997) are from Sydney and
Fremantle, on  opposite  sides  of  the  continent.  They  show
observed rates of relative sea level rise of 0.86 ± 0.12 mm/yr

Changes in Sea Level

UK; Stockholm, Sweden (detrended over the period 1774 to 1873 to remove to first order the contribution of postglacial rebound);

Mean Sea Level and include a nodal (18.6 year) term. The scale bar indicates ±100 mm. (Adapted from Woodworth, 1999a.)

and 1.38 ± 0.18 mm/yr over the periods 1915 to 1998 and 1897
to 1998 (Mitchell et al., 2000), corresponding to approximately
1.26  mm/yr  and  1.73  mm/yr  after  glacial  rebound  correction
using  the  Peltier  ICE-4G/M2  model, or  1.07  mm/yr  and  1.55
mm/yr using the corrections of Lambeck and Nakada (1990). 
There  have  been  only  two  analyses  of  global  sea  level
change based on the PSMSL data set published since the SAR.
Douglas  (1997)  provided  an  update  to  Douglas  (1991)  and
applied the PGR model of Tushingham and Peltier (1991) to a
selected  set  of  twenty-four  long  tide  gauge  records, grouped
into nine geographical areas, with minimum record length 60
years and average length 83 years. However, the only Southern
Hemisphere sites included in this solution were from Argentina
and  New  Zealand.  The  overall  global  average  of  1.8  ±  0.1
mm/yr agreed with the 1991 analysis, with considerable consis-
tency  between  area-average  trends.  The  standard  error  of  the
global rate was derived from the standard deviation of regional
trends, assuming  that  temporal  and  spatial  variability  is
uncorrelated  between  regions.  Peltier  and  Jiang  (1997)  used
essentially the same set of stations as Douglas and a new model
for postglacial rebound.

From Table 11.9 one can see that there are six global estimates
determined with the use of PGR corrections derived from global
models of isostatic adjustment, spanning a range from 1.4 mm/yr
(Mitrovica  and  Davis, 1995;  Davis  and  Mitrovica, 1996)  to  2.4
mm/yr  (Peltier  and  Tushingham, 1989, 1991). We  consider  that
these five are consistent within the systematic uncertainty of the
PGR models, which may have a range of uncertainty of 0.5 mm/yr
depending on earth structure parametrization employed (Mitrovica
and  Davis, 1995).  The  average  rate  of  the  five  estimates  is  1.8
mm/yr.  There  are  two  other  global  analyses, of  Gornitz  and
Lebedeff (1987) and Nakiboglu and Lambeck (1991), which yield
estimates of 1.2 mm/yr, lower than the first group. Because of the
issues raised above with regard to the geological data method for
land movement correction, the value of Gornitz and Lebedeff may
be underestimated by up to a few tenths of a millimetre per year,
although  such  considerations  do  not  affect  the  method  of
Nakiboglu and Lambeck. The differences between the former five
and latter two analyses reflect the analysis methods, in particular
the differences in corrections for land movements and in selections
of tide gauges used, including the effect of any spatial variation in
thermal  expansion.  However, all  the  discrepancies  which  could

Changes in Sea Level

arise as a consequence of different analysis methods remain to be
more  thoroughly  investigated.  On  the  basis  of  the  published
literature, we therefore cannot rule out an average rate of sea level
rise  of  as  little  as  1.0  mm/yr  during  the  20th  century.  For  the
upper bound, we adopt a limit of 2.0 mm/yr, which includes all
recent  global  estimates  with  some  allowance  for  systematic
uncertainty. As with other ranges (see Box 11.1), we do not imply
that the central value is the best estimate.

11.3.2.2 Long-term mean sea level accelerations
Comparison of the rate of sea level rise over the last 100 years
(1.0  to  2.0  mm/yr)  with  the  geological  rate  over  the  last  two
millennia (0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr; Section 11.3.1) implies a compara-
tively recent acceleration in the rate of sea level rise. The few
very  long  tide  gauge  records  are  especially  important  in  the
search  for  “accelerations” in  sea  level  rise.  Using  four  of  the
longest  (about  two  centuries)  records  from  north-west  Europe
(Amsterdam, Brest, Sheerness, Stockholm), Woodworth (1990)
found  long-term  accelerations  of  0.4  to  0.9  mm/yr/century
(Figure  11.7).  Woodworth  (1999a)  found  an  acceleration  of
order 0.3 mm/yr/century in the very long quasi-mean sea level
(or ‘Adjusted Mean High Water’) record from Liverpool. From
these  records, one  can  infer  that  the  onset  of  the  acceleration
occurred during the 19th century, a suggestion consistent with
separate analysis of the long Stockholm record (Ekman, 1988,
1999;  see  also  Mörner, 1973).  It  is  also  consistent  with  some
geological  evidence  from  north-west  Europe  (e.g., Allen  and
Rae, 1988). In North America, the longest records are from Key
West, Florida, which commenced in 1846 and which suggest an
acceleration  of  order  0.4  mm/year/century  (Maul  and  Martin,
1993), and  from  New  York  which  commenced  in  1856  and
which  has  a  similar  acceleration.  Coastal  evolution  evidence
from parts of eastern North America suggest an increased rate of
rise  between  one  and  two  centuries  before  the  20th  century
(Kearney and Stevenson, 1991; Varekamp et al., 1992; Kearney,
1996;  Van  de  Plassche  et  al., 1998;  Varekamp  and  Thomas,
1998; Shaw and Ceman, 2000). 

There is no evidence for any acceleration of sea level rise in
data  from  the  20th  century  data  alone  (Woodworth, 1990;
Gornitz  and  Solow, 1991;  Douglas, 1992).  Mediterranean
records show decelerations, and even decreases in sea level in
the  latter  part  of  the  20th  century, which  may  be  caused  by
increases  in  the  density  of  Mediterranean  Deep Water  and  air
pressure  changes  connected  to  the  North  Atlantic  Oscillation
(NAO)  (Tsimplis  and  Baker, 2000), suggesting  the
Mediterranean might not be the best area for monitoring secular
trends. Models of ocean thermal expansion indicate an accelera-
tion through the 20th century but when the model is subsampled
at the locations of the tide gauges no significant acceleration can
be detected because of the greater level of variability (Gregory
et al., 2001). Thus the absence of an acceleration in the observa-
tions is not necessarily inconsistent with the model results.

Figure 11.8: Global mean sea level variations (light line) computed
from the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter data compared with
the global averaged sea surface temperature variations (dark line) for
1993 to 1998 (Cazenave et al., 1998, updated). The seasonal
components have been removed from both time-series. 

radar altimetry provide near global and homogenous coverage of
the  world’s  oceans, thereby  allowing  the  determination  of
regional  sea  level  change.  Satellite  altimeters  also  measure  sea
level with respect to the centre of the earth. While the results must
be  corrected  for  isostatic  adjustment  (Peltier, 1998), satellite
altimetry avoids other vertical land movements (tectonic motions,
subsidence)  that  affect  local  determinations  of  sea  level  trends
measured by tide gauges. However, achieving the required sub-
millimetre  accuracy  is  demanding  and  requires  satellite  orbit
information, geophysical  and  environmental  corrections  and
altimeter  range  measurements  of  the  highest  accuracy.  It  also
requires  continuous  satellite  operations  over  many  years  and
careful control of biases. 

To date, the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite-altimeter mission,
with its (near) global coverage from 66°N to 66°S (almost all of
the ice-free oceans) from late 1992 to the present, has proved to
be  of  most  value  to  direct  estimates  of  sea  level  change.  The
current  accuracy  of  TOPEX/POSEIDON  data  allows  global
average  sea  level  to  be  estimated  to  a  precision  of  several
millimetres every 10 days, with the absolute accuracy limited by
systematic errors.

Careful  comparison  of  TOPEX/POSEIDON  data  with  tide
gauge data reveals a difference in the rate of change of local sea
level of −2.3 ± 1.2 mm/yr (Mitchum, 1998) or −2 ± 1.5 mm/yr
(Cazenave et al., 1999). This discrepancy is caused by a combina-
tion  of  instrumental  drift, especially  in  the  TOPEX  Microwave
Radiometer  (TMR)  (Haines  and  Bar-Sever, 1998), and  vertical
land motions which have not been allowed for in the tide gauge
data. The most recent estimates of global average sea level rise
from the six years of TOPEX/POSEIDON data (using corrections
from tide gauge comparisons) are 2.1 ± 1.2 mm/yr (Nerem et al.,
1997), 1.4 ± 0.2 mm/yr (Cazenave et al., 1998; Figure 11.8), 3.1
± 1.3 mm/yr (Nerem, 1999) and 2.5 ± 1.3 mm/yr (Nerem, 1999),
of which the last assumes that all instrumental drift can be attrib-
uted to the TMR. When Cazenave et al. allow for the TMR drift,
they compute a sea level rise of 2.6 mm/yr. Their uncertainty of

664

Changes in Sea Level

± 0.2 mm/yr does not include allowance for uncertainty in instru-
mental drift, but only reflects the variations in measured global sea
level.  Such  variations  correlate  with  global  average  sea  surface
temperature, perhaps  indicating  the  importance  of  steric  effects
through ocean heat storage. Cazenave et al. (1998) and Nerem et
al. (1999) argue that ENSO events cause a rise and a subsequent
fall in global averaged sea level of about 20 mm (Figure 11.8).
These findings indicate that the major 1997/98 El Niño-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) event could bias the above estimates of sea
level rise and also indicate the difficulty of separating long-term
trends from climatic variability. 

After upgrading many of the geophysical corrections on the
original European Remote Sensing (ERS) data stream, Cazenave
et al. (1998) find little evidence of sea level rise over the period
April 1992 to May 1996. However, over the time span of overlap
between the ERS-1 and TOPEX/POSEIDON data, similar rates
of  sea  level  change  (about  0.5 mm/yr)  are  calculated.  For  the
period April 1992 to April 1995, Anzenhofer and Gruber (1998)
find a sea level rise of 2.2 ± 1.6 mm/yr. 

In summary, analysis of TOPEX/POSEIDON data suggest a
rate of sea level rise during the 1990s greater than the mean rate
of rise for much of the 20th century. It is not yet clear whether
this is the result of a recent acceleration, of systematic differences
between the two measurement techniques, or of the shortness of
the record (6 years). 

11.3.3 Changes in Extreme Sea Levels: Storm Surges and 

Waves

Lack of adequate data sets means we can not ascertain whether
there have been changes in the magnitude and/or frequency of
storm surges (aperiodic changes associated with major meteoro-
logical  disturbances  resulting  in  sea  level  changes  of  up  to
several metres and lasting a few hours to days) in many regions
of the world. Zhang et al. (1997, 2000) performed a comprehen-
sive  analysis  of  hourly  tide  gauge  data  from  the  east  coast  of
North America, and concluded that there had been no discernible
secular trend in storm activity or severity during the past century.
European  analyses  include  that  of  Woodworth  (1999b), who
found no significant increase in extreme high water level distri-
butions from Liverpool from 1768 to 1993 to those from later
epochs, other than what can be explained in terms of changes in
local  tidal  amplitudes, mean  sea  level  and  vertical  land
movement. Vassie (reported in Pugh and Maul, 1999) and Bijl et
al. (1999) concluded that there was no discernible trend over the
last  century  in  the  statistics  of  non-tidal  sea  level  variability
around the UK and the eastern North Sea (Denmark, Germany
and  the  Netherlands), above  the  considerable  natural  sea  level
variability on decadal time-scales. In South America, D’Onofrio
et al. (1999) observed a trend of extreme levels at Buenos Aires
of 2.8 mm/yr over 1905 to 1993. On the basis of available statis-
tics, the South American result is consistent with the local mean
sea level trend.

Variations  in  surge  statistics  can  also  be  inferred  from
analysis  of  meteorological  data.  Kass  et  al. (1996)  and  the
WASA Group (1998) showed that there are no significant overall
trends in windiness and cyclonic activity over the North Atlantic

and north-west Europe during the past century, although major
variations on decadal times-scales exist. An increase in stormi-
ness in the north-east Atlantic in the last few decades (Schmith
et al., 1998) and a recent trend towards higher storm surge levels
on the German and Danish coasts (Langenberg et al., 1999) is
consistent with natural variability evident over the last 150 years.
Pirazzoli  (2000)  detected  evidence  for  a  slight  decrease  in  the
main  factors  contributing  to  surge  development  on  the  French
Atlantic  coast  in  the  last  50  years.  Correlation  between  the
frequency  of Atlantic  storms  and  ENSO  was  demonstrated  by
Van der Vink et al. (1998).

Increases in wave heights of approximately 2 to 3 m over
the  period  1962  to  1985  off  Land’s  End, south-west  England
(Carter  and  Draper, 1988), increases  in  wave  height  over  a
neighbouring area at about 2%/yr since 1950 (Bacon and Carter,
1991, 1993) and wave height variations simulated by the Wave
Action Model (WAM) (Günther et al., 1998) are all consistent
with decadal variations over most of the north-east Atlantic and
North Sea. This variability could be related to the NAO (Chapter
2, Section 2.6.5).

11.4 Can 20th Century Sea Level Changes be Explained?

In  order  to  have  confidence  in  our  ability  to  predict  future
changes  in  sea  level, we  need  to  confirm  that  the  relevant
processes  (Section  11.2)  have  been  correctly  identified  and
evaluated. We attempt this by seeing how well we can account for
the current rate of change (Section 11.3). We note that:

•  some  processes  affecting  sea  level  have  long  (centuries  and
longer)  time-scales, so  that  current  sea  level  change  is  also
related to past climate change,

• some relevant processes are not determined solely by climate,

•  fairly  long  records  (at  least  50  years  according  to  Douglas,
1992) are needed to detect a significant trend in local sea level,
because  of  the  influence  of  natural  variability  in  the  climate
system, and

• the network of tide gauges with records of this length gives only
a  limited  coverage  of  the  world’s  continental  coastline  and
almost no coverage of the mid-ocean.

The estimated contributions from the various components of sea
level rise during the 20th century (Table 11.10, Figure 11.9) were
constructed using the results from Section 11.2. The sum of these
contributions  for  the  20th  century  ranges  from  –0.8 mm/yr  to
2.2 mm/yr, with a central value of 0.7 mm/yr. The upper bound is
close  to  the  observational  upper  bound  (2.0  mm/yr), but  the
central  value  is  less  than  the  observational  lower  bound  (1.0
mm/yr), and  the  lower  bound  is  negative  i.e.  the  sum  of
components  is  biased  low  compared  to  the  observational
estimates.  Nonetheless, the  range  is  narrower  than  the  range
given by Warrick et al. (1996), as a result of greater constraints
on  all  the  contributions, with  the  exception  of  the  terrestrial
storage terms. In particular, the long-term contribution from the

the  model  uncertainties  may  be  underestimates  because  of  possible  systematic  errors  in  the  models.) The  20th  century  terms  for  Greenland  and
Antarctica are derived from ice sheet models because observations cannot distinguish between 20th century and long-term effects. See Section 11.2.3.3.

ice sheets has been narrowed substantially from those given in
Warrick et al. (1996) by the use of additional constraints (geolog-
ical data and models of the ice sheets) (Section 11.3.1).

The  reason  for  the  remaining  discrepancy  is  not  clear.
However, the largest uncertainty (by a factor of more than two)
is in the terrestrial storage terms. Several of the components of
the  terrestrial  storage  term  are  poorly  determined  and  the
quoted  limits  require  several  of  the  contributions  simultane-
ously to lie at the extremes of their ranges. This coincidence is
improbable unless the systematic errors affecting the estimates
are  correlated.  Furthermore, while  coupled  models  have
improved  considerably  in  recent  years, and  there  is  general
agreement  between  the  observed  and  modelled  thermal
expansion  contribution, the  models’ ability  to  quantitatively
simulate  decadal  changes  in  ocean  temperatures  and  thus
thermal  expansion  has  not  been  adequately  tested.  Given  the
poor global coverage of high quality tide gauge records and the
uncertainty  in  the  corrections  for  land  motions, the  observa-
tionally based rate of sea level rise this century should also be
questioned.

In the models, at least a third of 20th century anthropogenic
eustatic sea level rise is caused by thermal expansion, which has
a  geographically  non-uniform  signal  in  sea  level  change.
AOGCMs do not agree in detail about the patterns of geograph-
ical variation (see Section 11.5.2). They all give a geographical
spread of 20th century trends at individual grid points which is
characterised  by  a  standard  deviation  of  0.2  to  0.5  mm/yr
(Gregory et al., 2001). This spread is a result of a combination of
spatial non-uniformity of trends and the uncertainty in local trend
estimates arising from temporal variability. As yet no published
study has revealed a stable pattern of observed non-uniform sea
level  change.  Such  a  pattern  would  provide  a  critical  test  of
models.  If  there  is  significant  non-uniformity, a  trend  from  a
single  location  would  be  an  inaccurate  estimate  of  the  global
average. For example, Douglas (1997) averaged nine regions and
found  a  standard  deviation  of  about  0.3  mm/yr  (quoted  by
Douglas as a standard error), similar to the range expected from
AOGCMs. 

A common perception is that the rate of sea level rise should
have accelerated during the latter half of the 20th century. The tide
gauge data for the 20th century show no significant acceleration
(e.g., Douglas, 1992).  We  have  obtained  estimates  based  on
AOGCMs for the terms directly related to anthropogenic climate
change  in  the  20th  century, i.e., thermal  expansion  (Section
11.2.1.2), ice  sheets  (Section  11.2.3.3), glaciers  and  ice  caps
(Section 11.5.1.1) (Figure 11.10a). The estimated rate of sea level
rise  from  anthropogenic  climate  change  ranges  from  0.3  to
0.8 mm/yr (Figure 11.10b). These terms do show an acceleration
through  the  20th  century  (Figure  11.10a,b).  If  the  terrestrial
storage  terms  have  a  negative  sum  (Section  11.2.5), they  may
offset  some  of  the  acceleration  in  recent  decades.  The  total
computed rise (Figure 11.10c) indicates an acceleration of only
0.2 mm/yr/century, with a range from −1.1 to +0.7 mm/yr/century,

consistent  with  observational  finding  of  no  acceleration  in  sea
level rise during the 20th century (Section 11.3.2.2). The sum of
terms not related to recent climate change is −1.1 to +0.9 mm/yr
(i.e., excluding  thermal  expansion, glaciers  and  ice  caps, and
changes in the ice sheets due to 20th century climate change). This
range is less than the observational lower bound of sea level rise.
Hence it is very likely that these terms alone are an insufficient
explanation, implying that 20th century climate change has made
a contribution to 20th century sea level rise.

Recent  studies  (see  Sections  2.3.3, 2.3.4)  suggest  that  the
19th century was unusually cold on the global average, and that
an increase in solar output may have had a moderate influence on
warming  in  the  early  20th  century  (Section  12.4.3.3).  This
warming  might  have  produced  some  thermal  expansion  and
could have been responsible for the onset of glacier recession in
the  early  20th  century  (e.g., Dowdeswell  et  al., 1997), thus
providing a possible explanation of an acceleration in sea level
rise commencing before major industrialisation.

11.5 Future Sea Level Changes

11.5.1 Global Average Sea Level Change 1990 to 2100

Warrick et al. (1996) made projections of thermal expansion and
of loss of mass from glaciers and ice-sheets for the 21st century
for  the  IS92  scenarios  using  two  alternative  simple  climate
models. Since the SAR, time-dependent experiments have been
run with several AOGCMs (Chapter 9.1.2, Table 9.1) following
the IS92a scenario (Leggett et al., 1992) for future concentrations
of  greenhouse  gases, including  the  direct  effect  of  sulphate
aerosols. In Section 11.5.1.1, we use the AOGCM IS92a results
to  derive  estimates  of  thermal  expansion  and  land  ice  melt,
employing  methods  from  the  literature  as  described  in  Section
11.2, and  we  add  contributions  from  thawing  of  permafrost,
sediment  deposition, and  the  continuing  adjustment  of  the  ice
sheets to climate changes since the LGM. The choice of scenario
is  not  the  principal  consideration;  the  main  point  is  that  the
AOGCMs all follow the same scenario, so the range of results
reflects the systematic uncertainty inherent in the modelling of
sea level changes. The use of IS92a also facilitates comparison
with the result of Warrick et al. (1996).

To quantify the uncertainty resulting from the uncertainty in
future emissions, and to obtain results consistent with the global-
average  temperature  change  projections  of  Section  9.3.3, in
Section 11.5.1.2 we derive projections for thermal expansion and
land  ice  melt  for  the  scenarios  of  the  IPCC  Special  Report  on
Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (Nakic´enovic´ et al., 2000) (see also
Box 9.1 in Chapter 9, Section 9.1). The results are given as sea
level  change  relative  to  1990  in  order  to  facilitate  comparison
with previous IPCC reports, which used 1990 as their base date.

thermal expansion in the range 0.09 to 0.37 m (Figure 11.1, Table
11.11).  There  is  an  acceleration  through  the  21st  century;
expansion for 2040 to 2090 is greater than for 1990 to 2040 by a
factor of 1.4 to 2.1. Since the models experience the same forcing,
the differences in the thermal expansion derive from differences in
the physical behaviour of the models. Broadly speaking, the range
of results reflects the systematic uncertainty of modelling in three
factors: the size of the surface warming, the effectiveness of heat
uptake by the ocean for a given warming (Gregory and Mitchell,
1997)  and  the  expansion  resulting  from  a  given  heat  uptake
(Russell  et  al., 2000).  The  separation  of  the  first  two  factors
parallels the distinction made in Section 9.3.4.2 between the effects
of climate feedback and heat uptake on the rate of climate change.
Since  models  differ  in  regard  to  the  second  and  third  factors,
experiments with a similar temperature change do not necessarily
have a similar thermal expansion, as the results demonstrate.

Glaciers and ice caps
To make projections for future loss of mass from glaciers and ice
caps, we  have  applied  the  methods  of  Gregory  and  Oerlemans
(1998)  and  Van  de  Wal  and  Wild  (2001)  (Sections  11.2.2.2,
11.2.2.4) to the seasonally and geographically dependent temper-
ature changes given by a range of AOGCM IS92a experiments
including sulphate aerosols (Table 11.12). We adjust the results to
be consistent with the assumption that the climate of 1865 to 1895
was 0.15 K warmer than the steady state for glaciers, following
Zuo and Oerlemans (1997) (see also Section 11.4). Precipitation
changes are not included, as they are not expected to have a strong
influence on the global average (Section 11.2.2.3).

For constant glacier area, from the AOGCM IS92a experi-
ments  including  sulphate  aerosol, predicted  sea  level  rise  from
glacier melt over the hundred years 1990 to 2090 lies in the range
0.06  to  0.15  m. The  variation  is  due  to  three  factors.  First, the
global  average  temperature  change  varies  between  models.  A
larger temperature rise tends to give more melting, but they are
not  linearly  related, since  the  total  melt  depends  on  the  time-
integrated temperature change. Second, the global mass balance
sensitivity  to  temperature  change  varies  among  AOGCMs
because  of  their  different  seasonal  and  regional  distribution  of
temperature change. Third, the glaciers are already adjusting to
climate change during the 20th century, and any such imbalance
will  persist  during  the  21st  century, in  addition  to  the  further
imbalance  due  to  future  climate  change.  The  global  average
temperature change and glacier mass balance sensitivity may not
be  independent  factors, since  both  are  affected  by  regional
climate feedbacks. The sensitivity and the present imbalance are
related  factors, because  a  larger  sensitivity  implies  a  greater
present imbalance.

With  glacier  area  contracting  as  the  volume  reduces, the
estimated sea level rise contribution is in the range 0.05 to 0.11 m,
about 25% less than if constant area is assumed, similar to the
findings  of  Oerlemans  et  al. (1998)  and Van  de Wal  and Wild
(2001). The  time-dependence  of  glacier  area  means  the  results
can  no  longer  be  represented  by  a  global  glacier  mass  balance
sensitivity. 

Glaciers and ice caps on the margins of the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets are omitted from these calculations, because
they  are  included  in  the  ice  sheet  projections  below. These  ice
masses  have  a  large  area  (Table  11.3), but  experience  little
ablation on account of being in very cold climates. Van de Wal

and  Wild  (2001)  find  that  the  Greenland  marginal  glaciers
contribute an additional 6% to glacier melt in a scenario of CO2
doubling over 70 years. Similar calculations using the AOGCM
IS92a results give a maximum contribution of 14 mm for 1990 to
2100. For the Antarctic marginal glaciers, the ambient tempera-
tures are too low for there to be any significant surface runoff.
Increasing temperatures will increase the runoff and enlarge the
area experiencing ablation, but their contribution is very likely to
remain small. For instance, Drewry and Morris (1992) calculate
a  contribution  of  0.012  mm/yr/°C  to  the  global  glacier  mass
balance  sensitivity  from  the  glacier  area  of  20,000  km2 which
currently experiences some melting on the Antarctic Peninsula.
Lack of information concerning glacier areas and precipita-
tion  over  glaciers, together  with  uncertainty  over  the  projected
changes in glacier area, lead to uncertainty in the results. This is
assessed  as  ±  40%, matching  the  uncertainty  of  the  observed
mass balance estimate of Dyurgerov and Meier (1997b).

Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
To make projections of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass
changes  consistent  with  the  IS92a  AOGCM  experiments
including  sulphate  aerosols, we  have  integrated  the  ice-sheet
model  of  Huybrechts  and  De  Wolde  (1999)  using  boundary
conditions of temperature and precipitation derived by perturbing
present  day  climatology  according  to  the  geographically  and
seasonally  dependent  pattern  changes  predicted  by  the  T106
ECHAM4  model  (Wild  and  Ohmura, 2000)  for  a  doubling  of
CO2.  To  generate  time-dependent  boundary  conditions, these
patterns were scaled with the area average changes over the ice
sheets as a function of time for each AOGCM experiment using
a method similar to that described by Huybrechts et al. (1999).

ending at earlier dates. The uncertainties shown in the land ice terms are those discussed in this section. For comparison the projection of Warrick
et al. (1996) (in the SAR) is also included. Note that the minimum of the sum of the components is not identical with the sum of the minima because
the smallest values of the components do not all come from the same AOGCM, and because for each model the land ice uncertainties have been
combined in quadrature; similarly for the maxima, which also include non-zero contributions from smaller terms.

b Including contributions from permafrost, sedimentation, and adjustment of ice sheets to past climate change.

The marginal glaciers and ice caps on Greenland and Antarctica
were included in the ice sheet area. The calculated contributions
from these small ice masses have some uncertainty resulting from
the limited spatial resolution of the ice sheet model.

For  1990  to  2090  in  the  AOGCM  GS  experiments,
Greenland  contributes  0.01  to  0.03  m  and Antarctica  –0.07  to
–0.01 m to global average sea level (Table 11.13). Note that these
sea  level  contributions  result  solely  from  recent  and  projected
future climate change; they do not include the response to past
climate change (discussed in Sections 11.2.3.3 and 11.3.1).

Mass balance sensitivities are derived by regressing rate of
change of mass against global or local temperature change (note
that  they  include  the  effect  of  precipitation  changes)  (Table
11.13). The Greenland local sensitivities are smaller than some of
the  values  reported  previously  from  other  methods  (Section
11.2.3.4 and Table 11.7) and by Warrick et al. (1996) because of
the larger precipitation increases and the seasonality of tempera-
ture changes (less increase in summer) predicted by AOGCMs,
and  the  smaller  temperature  rise  in  the  ablation  zone  (as
compared  to  the  ice-sheet  average)  projected  by  the  T106
ECHAM4 time slice results. The Antarctic sensitivities are less
negative than those in Table 11.7 because the AOGCMs predict
smaller precipitation increases.

The use of a range of AOGCMs represents the uncertainty
in modelling changing circulation patterns, which lead to both
changes in temperature and precipitation, as noted by Kapsner et
al.  (1995)  and  Cuffey  and  Clow  (1997)  from  the  results  from
Greenland ice cores. The range of AOGCM thermodynamic and
circulation responses gives a range of 4 to 8%/°C for Greenland
precipitation increases, generally less than indicated by ice-cores

for the glacial-interglacial transition, but more than for Holocene
variability (Section 11.2.3.4). If precipitation did not increase at
all  with  greenhouse  warming, Greenland  local  sensitivities
would be larger, by 0.05 to 0.1 mm/yr/°C (see also Table 11.7).
Given that all AOGCMs agree on an increase, but differ on the
strength of the relationship, we include an uncertainty of ±0.02
mm/yr/°C  in  Table  11.13  on  the  Greenland  local  sensitivities,
being  the  product  of  the  standard  deviation  of  precipitation
increase (1.5%/°C) and the current Greenland accumulation (1.4
mm/yr sea level equivalent, Table 11.5).

Estimates of Greenland runoff (Table 11.5) have a standard
error of about ± 10%. This reflects uncertainty in the degree-day
method  (Braithwaite, 1995)  and  refreezing  parametrization
(Janssens  and  Huybrechts, 2000)  used  to  calculate  Greenland
ablation. Given that a typical size of the sensitivity of ablation to
temperature change is 0.3 mm/yr/°C (Table 11.7), we adopt an
additional  uncertainty  of  ±  0.03  mm/yr/°C  for  the  local
Greenland  sensitivities  in  Table  11.13.  We  include  a  separate
uncertainty of the same size to reflect the possible sensitivity to
use of different high-resolution geographical patterns of temper-
ature and precipitation change (the T106 ECHAM4 pattern was
the only one available). As an estimate of the uncertainty related
to changes in iceberg discharge and area-elevation distribution,
we ascribe an uncertainty of ± 10% to the net mass change, on
the basis of the magnitude of the dynamic response for Greenland
described in Section 11.2.3.4.

For Antarctica, uncertainty  introduced  by  ablation  model
parameters  need  not  be  considered  because  melting  remains
very small for the temperature scenarios considered for the 21st
century. Ice-dynamical uncertainties are much more difficult to

Figure 11.11: Global average sea level rise 1990 to 2100 for the IS92a scenario, including the direct effect of sulphate aerosols. Thermal
expansion and land ice changes were calculated from AOGCM experiments, and contributions from changes in permafrost, the effect of
sediment deposition and the long-term adjustment of the ice sheets to past climate change were added. For the models that project the largest
(CGCM1) and the smallest (MRI2) sea level change, the shaded region shows the bounds of uncertainty associated with land ice changes,
permafrost changes and sediment deposition. Uncertainties are not shown for the other models, but can be found in Table 11.14. The outermost
limits of the shaded regions indicate our range of uncertainty in projecting sea level change for the IS92a scenario.

determine.  See  Section  11.5.4.3  for  a  detailed  discussion. We
include an uncertainty of 0.08 mm/yr/°C on the local sensitivity,
which is its inter-model standard deviation, to reflect the spread
of precipitation changes as a function of temperature.

Total
To obtain predictions of global average sea level rise for 1990-
2100 for the IS92a scenario with sulphate aerosols, we calculate
the  sum  of  the  contributions  from  thermal  expansion, glaciers
and  ice  sheets  for  each AOGCM, and  add  the  0  to  0.5  mm/yr
from  the  continuing  evolution  of  the  ice  sheets  in  response  to
past climate change (Section 11.2.3.1) and smaller terms from
thawing  of  permafrost  (Section  11.2.5)  and  the  effect  of
sedimentation (Section 11.2.6). The range of our results is 0.11
to  0.77  m  (Table  11.14, Figure  11.11), which  should  be
compared with the range of 0.20 to 0.86 m given by Warrick et
al. (1996)  (SAR  Section  7.5.2.4, Figure  7.7)  for  the  same
scenario.  The  AOGCMs  have  a  range  of  effective  climate
sensitivities from 1.4 to 4.2°C (Table 9.1), similar to the range of
1.5  to  4.5°C  used  by  Warrick  et  al. The  AOGCM  thermal
expansion values are generally larger than those of Warrick et al.
(SAR Section 7.5.2.4, Figure 7.8), but the other terms are mostly
smaller (i.e., more negative in the case of Antarctica).

Warrick  et  al. included  a  positive  term  to  allow  for  the
possible instability of the WAIS. We have omitted this because
it  is  now  widely  agreed  that  major  loss  of  grounded  ice  and
accelerated  sea  level  rise  are  very  unlikely  during  the  21st
century (Section 11.5.4.3). The size of our range is an indica-
tion  of  the  systematic  uncertainty  in  modelling  radiative
forcing, climate  and  sea  level  changes.  Uncertainties  in
modelling the carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry are not
covered  by  this  range, because  the  AOGCMs  are  all  given
similar atmospheric concentrations as input.

11.5.1.2 Projections for SRES scenarios
Few  AOGCM  experiments  have  been  done  with  any  of  the
SRES emissions scenarios. Therefore to establish the range of
sea  level  rise  resulting  from  the  choice  of  different  SRES
scenarios, we  use  results  for  thermal  expansion  and  global-
average  temperature  change  from  a  simple  climate  model
based on that of Raper et al. (1996) and calibrated individually
for  seven  AOGCMs  (CSIRO  Mk2, CSM  1.3, ECHAM4/

Figure 11.12: Global average sea level rise 1990 to 2100 for the SRES scenarios. Thermal expansion and land ice changes were calculated using a
simple climate model calibrated separately for each of seven AOGCMs, and contributions from changes in permafrost, the effect of sediment
deposition and the long-term adjustment of the ice sheets to past climate change were added. Each of the six lines appearing in the key is the
average of AOGCMs for one of the six illustrative scenarios. The region in dark shading shows the range of the average of AOGCMs for all 35
SRES scenarios. The region in light shading shows the range of all AOGCMs for all 35 scenarios. The region delimited by the outermost lines
shows the range of all AOGCMs and scenarios including uncertainty in land-ice changes, permafrost changes and sediment deposition. Note that
this range does not allow for uncertainty relating to ice-dynamical changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet. See 11.5.4.3 for a full discussion. The
bars show the range in 2100 of all AOGCMs for the six illustrative scenarios.

calculate land-ice changes using the global average temperature
change  from  the  simple  model  and  the  global  average  mass
balance sensitivities estimated from the AOGCM IS92a experi-
ments  in  Section  11.5.1.1  (Tables  11.12  and  11.13).  We  add
contributions from the continuing evolution of the ice sheets in
response to past climate change, thawing of permafrost, and the
effect of sedimentation (the same as in Section 11.5.1.1). The
methods used to make the sea level projections are documented
in detail in the Appendix to this chapter.

For the  complete range of AOGCMs and  SRES  scenarios
and  including  uncertainties  in  land-ice  changes, permafrost
changes  and  sediment  deposition, global  average  sea  level  is
projected to rise by 0.09 to 0.88 m over 1990 to 2100, with a
central value of 0.48 m (Figure 11.12). The central value gives
an average rate of 2.2 to 4.4 times the rate over the 20th century.
The corresponding range reported by Warrick et al. (1996)
(representing  scenario  uncertainty  by  using  all  the  IS92
scenarios  with  time-dependent  sulphate  aerosol)  was  0.13  to
0.94 m, obtained using a simple model with climate sensitivities

of 1.5 to 4.5°C. Their upper bound is larger than ours. Ice sheet
mass balance sensitivities derived from AOGCMs (see Section
11.5.1.1) are smaller (less positive or more negative) than those
used by Warrick et al., while the method we have employed for
calculating  glacier  mass  loss  (Sections  11.2.2  and  11.5.1.1)
gives a smaller sea level contribution for similar scenarios than
the  heuristic  model  of Wigley  and  Raper  (1995)  employed  by
Warrick et al. 

In  addition, Warrick et  al.  included  an  allowance  for  ice-
dynamical changes in the WAIS. The range we have given does
not  include  such  changes.  The  contribution  of  the  WAIS  is
potentially  important  on  the  longer  term, but  it  is  now  widely
agreed  that  major  loss  of  grounded  ice  from  the  WAIS  and
consequent  accelerated  sea-level  rise  are  very  unlikely  during
the 21st century. Allowing for the possible effects of processes
not adequately represented in present models, two risk assess-
ment  studies  involving  panels  of  experts  concluded  that  there
was a 5% chance that by 2100 the WAIS could make a substan-
tial  contribution  to  sea  level  rise, of  0.16  m  (Titus  and

Narayanan, 1996) or 0.5 m (Vaughan and Spouge, 2001). These
studies also noted a 5% chance of WAIS contributing a sea level
fall of 0.18 m or 0.4 m respectively. (See Section 11.5.4.3 for a
full discussion.) 

The  range  we  have  given  also  does  not  take  account  of
uncertainty in modelling of radiative forcing, the carbon cycle,
atmospheric  chemistry, or  storage  of  water  in  the  terrestrial
environment. The recent publications by Gornitz et al. (1997)
and Sahagian (2000) indicate that this last term could be signif-
icant  (Section  11.2.5).  Future  changes  in  terrestrial  storage
depend  on  societal  decisions  on  the  use  of  ground  water, the
building of reservoirs and other factors. We are not currently in
a position to make projections incorporating future changes in
these factors, although we note that the assumptions behind the
construction  of  the  SRES  scenarios  imply  increasing  water
consumption, which may entail both more ground water extrac-
tion  and  more  reservoir  capacity.  Continued  anthropogenic
water  storage  on  land  at  its  current  rate  could  change  the
projected  sea  level  rise  1990  to  2100  by  between  –0.21  and
+0.11 m. We emphasise that estimates of the relevant factors are
highly uncertain (see Sections 11.2.5 and 11.4).

The evolution of sea level rise for the average of the seven
AOGCMs  for  each  of  the  six  illustrative  SRES  scenarios  is
shown in Figure 11.12, and the shading shows the range for all
35 SRES scenarios. It is apparent that the variation due to the
choice  of  scenario  alone  is  relatively  small  over  the  next  few
decades. The range spanned by the SRES scenarios by 2040 is
only 0.02 m or less. By 2100, the scenario range has increased
to  0.18  m, about  50%  of  the  central  value. All  the AOGCMs
have  a  similar  range  at  2100  expressed  as  a  fraction  of  their
central value. Of the six illustrative scenarios, A1FI gives the
largest sea level rise and B1 the smallest.

The  average-AOGCM  range  for  all  35  scenarios  (dark
shading  in  Figure  11.12)  covers  about  one  third  of  the  all-
AOGCM range (light shading). That is, for sea level rise 1990
to 2100, the uncertainty in climate sensitivity and heat uptake,
represented by the spread of AOGCMs, is more important than
the  uncertainty  from  choice  of  emissions  scenario.  This  is

different  for  three  reasons  from  the  case  of  global  average
temperature  change  (Section  9.3.2.1), where  the  scenario  and
modelling  uncertainties  are  comparable.  First, the  compensa-
tion between climate sensitivity and heat uptake does not apply
to  thermal  expansion.  Second, models  with  large  climate
sensitivity  and  temperature  change  consequently  have  a  large
land-ice  melt  contribution  to  sea  level.  Third, both  thermal
expansion  and  land-ice  melt  depend  on  past  climate  change,
being  approximately  proportional  to  the  time-integral  of
temperature  change;  the  SRES  scenarios  differ  by  less  in
respect  of  the  time-integral  of  temperature  change  over  the
interval 1990 to 2100 than they do in respect of the temperature
change at 2100.

11.5.2 Regional Sea Level Change

The  geographical  distribution  of  sea  level  change  caused  by
ocean  processes  can  be  calculated  from  AOGCM  results  (see
Gregory et al., 2001, for methods). This was not possible with the
simple climate models used by Warrick et al. (1996). Results for
sea  level  change  from  ocean  processes  in  the  21st  century  are
shown in Figure 11.13 for AOGCM experiments used in Section
11.5.1.1. Some regions show a sea level rise substantially more
than the global average (in many cases of more than twice the
average), and others a sea level fall (Table 11.15) (note that these
figures do not include sea level rise due to land ice changes). The
standard deviation of sea level change is 15 to 35% of the global
average sea level rise from thermal expansion.

In each of these experiments, a non-uniform pattern of sea
level rise emerges above the background of temporal variability
in the latter part of the 21st century. However, the patterns given
by the different models (Figure 11.13) are not similar in detail.
The largest correlations are between models which are similar in
formulation: 0.65 between CGCM1 and CGCM2, 0.63 between
GFDL_R15_b  and  GFDL_R30_c.  The  largest  correlations
between models from different centres are 0.60 between CSIRO
Mk2 and HadCM2, 0.58 between CGCM2 and GFDL_R30_c.
The  majority  of  correlations  are  less  than  0.4, indicating  no

674

Changes in Sea Level

significant  similarity  (Gregory  et  al., 2001).  The  disagreement
between models is partly a reflection of the differences in ocean
model formulation that are also responsible for the spread in the
global  average  heat  uptake  and  thermal  expansion  (Sections
11.2.1.2, 11.5.1.1).  In  addition, the  models  predict  different
changes in surface windstress, with consequences for changes in
ocean  circulation  and  subduction.  More  detailed  analysis  is
needed  to  elucidate  the  reasons  for  the  differences  in  patterns.
The lack of similarity means that our confidence in predictions of
local sea level changes is low. However, we can identify a few
common  features  on  the  regional  and  basin  scale  (see  also
Gregory et al., 2001).

Seven of the nine models in Table 11.14 (also Bryan, 1996;
Russell et al., 2000) exhibit a maximum sea level rise in the Arctic
Ocean. A possible reason for this is a freshening of the Arctic due
to increased river runoff or precipitation over the ocean (Bryan,
1996;  Miller  and  Russell, 2000).  The  fall  in  salinity  leads  to  a
reduction of density, which requires a compensating sea level rise
in order to maintain the pressure gradient at depth. 

Seven of the models (also Gregory, 1993; Bryan, 1996) show
a minimum of sea level rise in the circumpolar Southern Ocean
south  of  60°S.  This  occurs  despite  the  fact  that  the  Southern
Ocean is a region of pronounced heat uptake (e.g., Murphy and
Mitchell, 1995;  Hirst  et  al., 1996). The  low  thermal  expansion
coefficient at the cold temperatures of the high southern latitudes,
changes  in  wind  patterns  and  transport  of  the  heat  taken  up  to
lower latitudes are all possible explanations.

Bryan (1996) draws attention to a dipole pattern in sea level
change in the north-west Atlantic; there is a reduced rise south of
the Gulf Stream extension and enhanced rise to the north, which
corresponds to a weakening of the sea surface gradient across the
current. This would be consistent with a weakening of the upper

branch of the North Atlantic circulation, which is a response to
greenhouse  warming  observed  in  many  AOGCM  experiments
(e.g., Manabe and Stouffer, 1993, 1994; Hirst, 1998). This can be
seen in all the models considered here except ECHAM4/OPYC3,
in which the Atlantic thermohaline circulation does not weaken
(Latif and Roeckner, 2000).

Local land movements, both isostatic and tectonic (Sections
11.2.4.1, 11.2.6), will continue in the 21st century at rates which
are  unaffected  by  climate  change, and  should  be  added  to  the
regional  variation  described  in  this  section.  On  account  of  the
increased eustatic rate of rise in the 21st century (Section 11.5.1)
it can be expected that by 2100 many regions currently experi-
encing  relative  sea  level  fall  owing  to  isostatic  rebound  will
instead have a rising relative sea level.

All the global models discussed here have a spatial resolu-
tion  of  1  to  3°.  To  obtain  information  about  mean  sea  level
changes at higher resolution is currently not practical; a regional
model such as that of Kauker (1998) would be needed.

11.5.3 Implications for Coastal Regions

To determine the practical consequences of projections of global
sea  level  rise  in  particular  coastal  regions, it  is  necessary  to
understand the various components leading to relative sea level
changes.  These  components  include  local  land  movements,
global  eustatic  sea  level  rise, any  spatial  variability  from  that
global average, local meteorological changes and changes in the
frequency of extreme events. 

11.5.3.1 Mean sea level
Titus  and  Narayanan  (1996)  propose  a  simple  method  for
computing local projections of mean sea level rise given histor-
ical observations at a site and projections of global average sea
level (such as Figure 11.12). To allow for local land movements
and  our  current  inability  to  model  sea  level  change  accurately
(Section 11.4), they propose linearly extrapolating the historical
record  and  adding  to  this  a  globally  averaged  projection.
However, they  point  out  that  to  avoid  double  counting, it  is
necessary to correct the global projection for the corresponding
modelled trend of sea level rise during the period of the histor-
ical  observations.  Caution  is  required  in  applying  this  method
directly  to  the  projections  of  this  chapter  for  several  reasons.
First, current  model  projections  indicate  substantial  spatial
variability  in  sea  level  rise.  This  variability  has  a  standard
deviation of up to 0.1 m by 2100; some locations experience a
sea  level  rise  of  more  than  twice  the  global-average  thermal
expansion, while  others  may  have  a  fall  in  sea  level  (Section
11.5.2;  Table  11.15).  Second, there  are  uncertainties  in  the
accuracy of the trend from the historical record and in modelling
of past sea level changes (Sections 11.3.2.1 and 11.4). Third, as
well as changes in mean sea level there may be changes in the
local  meteorological  regime  resulting  in  modified  storm  surge
statistics  (Section  11.5.3.2).  If  the  method  of  Titus  and
Narayanan  is  not  applied, it  is  nonetheless  important  to
recognise that in all models and scenarios the rate of local sea
level rise in the 21st century is projected to be greater than in the
20th century at the great majority of coastal locations.

11.5.3.2 Extremes of sea level: storm surges and waves 
The  probability  of  flood  risk  in  coastal  areas  is  generally
expressed in terms of extreme sea level distributions. Such distri-
butions  are  usually  computed  from  observed  annual  maximum
sea  levels  from  several  decades  of  tide  gauge  data, or  from
numerical models. While such distributions are readily available
for many locations, a worldwide set has never been computed to
common  standards  for  studies  of  impacts  of  global  sea  level
change. 

Changes in the highest sea levels at a given locality could
result mainly from two effects. First, if mean sea level rises, the
present extreme levels will be attained more frequently, all else
being equal. This may imply a significant increase in the area
threatened with inundation (e.g., Hubbert and McInnes, 1999)
and an increased risk within the existing flood plain. The effect
can  be  estimated  from  a  knowledge  of  the  present  day
frequency  of  occurrence  of  extreme  levels  (e.g., Flather  and
Khandker, 1993; Lowe et al., 2001; Figure 11.14). 

Second, changes in storm surge heights would result from
alterations  to  the  occurrence  of  strong  winds  and  low
pressures. At low-latitude locations, such as the Bay of Bengal,
northern Australia and the southern USA, tropical cyclones are
the primary cause of storm surges. Changes in frequency and
intensity  of  tropical  cyclones  could  result  from  alterations  to
sea  surface  temperature, large-scale  atmospheric  circulation
and the characteristics of ENSO (Pittock et al., 1996) but no
consensus  has  yet  emerged  (see  Box  10.2).  In  other  places,
such  as  southern  Australia  and  north-west  Europe, storm
surges are associated with mid-latitude low-pressure systems.
For  instance, Hubbert  and  McInnes  (1999)  showed  that
increasing  the  wind  speeds  in  historical  storm  surge  events
associated with the passage of cold fronts could lead to greater
flooding  in  Port  Phillip  Bay, Victoria, Australia.  Changes  in
extratropical storms also cannot be predicted with confidence
(Section 9.3.6.3).

Several  studies  have  attempted  to  quantify  the
consequences of changes in storm climatology for the north-

west European continental shelf using regional models of the
atmosphere  and  ocean.  Using  five-year  integrations  of  the
ECHAM T106 model for present and doubled CO2, Von Storch
and Reichardt (1997) and Flather and Smith (1998) did not find
any significant changes in extreme events compared with the
variability  of  the  control  climate  (see  also  WASA  Group,
1998).  However, Langenberg  et  al. (1999)  reported  increases
of 0.05 to 0.10 m in five-winter-mean high-water levels around
all  North  Sea  coasts, judged  to  be  significant  compared  with
observed  natural  variability.  Lowe  et  al. (2001)  undertook  a
similar  study  using  multi-decadal  integrations  of  the  Hadley
Centre regional climate model for the present climate and the
end  of  the  21st  century  (Figure  11.14), finding  statistically
significant changes of up to 0.2 m in five-year extremes in the
English  Channel.  Differences  between  these  various  results
relate  to  the  length  of  model  integration  and  to  systematic
uncertainty  in  the  modelling  of  both  the  atmospheric  forcing
and the ocean response.

Changes in wind forcing could result in changes to wave
heights, but  with  the  short  integrations  available, the  WASA
Group (Rider et al., 1996) were not able to identify any signif-
icant  changes  for  the  North  Atlantic  and  North  Sea  for  a
doubling of CO2. Günther et al. (1998) noted that changes in
future wave climate were similar to patterns of past variation.

11.5.4 Longer Term Changes

Anthropogenic  emissions  beyond  2100  are  very  uncertain, and
we can only indicate a range of possibilities for sea level change.
On the time-scale of centuries, thermal expansion and ice sheet
changes are likely to be the most important processes.

11.5.4.1 Thermal expansion
The  most  important  conclusion  for  thermal  expansion  is  that  it
would continue to raise sea level for many centuries after stabili-
sation  of  greenhouse  gas  concentrations, so  that  its  eventual
contribution would be much larger than at the time of stabilisation.

A number of investigations have aimed to quantify this delayed
but  inevitable  consequence  of  the  enhanced  greenhouse  effect,
using a simple scenario in which carbon dioxide concentration
increases rapidly (at 1%/yr, not intended as a realistic historical
scenario) up to double or four times its initial value (referred to
as 2×CO2 and 4×CO2), and thereafter remains constant. (2×CO2
is about 540 ppm by volume, and 4×CO2 about 1080 ppm.) Long
experiments  of  this  kind  have  been  run  with  three  AOGCMs
(Chapter  8, Table  8.1): GFDL  (Manabe  and  Stouffer, 1994;
Stouffer  and  Manabe, 1999), ECHAM3/LSG  (Voss  and
Mikolajewicz, 2001) and HadCM2 (Senior and Mitchell, 2000),
but owing to the computational requirement, only one of these
(GFDL)  has  been  continued  until  a  steady  state  is  reached.
Models of intermediate complexity (Chapter 8, Table 8.1) have
also  been  employed: CLIMBER, BERN2D  and  UVic.  These
models  have  a  less  detailed  representation  of  some  important
processes, but are less expensive to run for millennia. 

Thermal  expansion  could  be  greater  in  one  model  than
another either because the surface warming is larger, or because
the warming penetrates more deeply (Figure 11.15, Table 11.16;
the  suffixes  to  the  BERN2D  and  UVic  model  names  indicate
versions  of  the  models  with  different  parametrizations  of  heat
transport processes). For instance, UVic H and UVic GM show
markedly different expansion, although they have similar surface
warming  (Weaver  and  Wiebe, 1999).  The  4×CO2 experiment
with each model generally has around twice the expansion of the
2×CO2 experiment, but  the  BERN2D  HOR  4×CO2 experiment
has  more  than  three  times, because  the  Atlantic  thermohaline
circulation  collapses, permitting  greater  warming  and  adding
about  0.5  m  to  thermal  expansion  (Knutti  and  Stocker, 2000).

Figure 11.16: Response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to three climatic
warming scenarios during the third millennium expressed in equivalent
changes of global sea level. The curve labels refer to the mean annual
temperature rise over Greenland by 3000 AD as predicted by a two-
dimensional climate and ocean model forced by greenhouse gas
concentration rises until 2130 AD and kept constant after that. (From
Huybrechts and De Wolde, 1999.) Note that projected temperatures
over Greenland are generally greater than globally averaged tempera-
tures (by a factor of 1.2 to 3.1 for the range of AOGCMs used in this
chapter). See Table 11.13 and Chapter 9, Fig 9.10c.

vertical  temperature  gradient  is  maintained, although  in  some
cases  weakened.  If  the  whole  depth  of  the  ocean  warmed  to
match  the  surface  temperature, thermal  expansion  would  be
considerably larger.

The long time-scale (of the order of 1,000 years) on which
thermal expansion approaches its eventual level is characteristic
of  the  weak  diffusion  and  slow  circulation  processes  that
transport heat to the deep ocean. On account of the time-scale,
the thermal expansion in the 2×CO2 experiments after 500 years
of constant CO2 is 4 to 9 times greater than at the time when the
concentration  stabilises.  Even  by  this  time, it  may  only  have
reached half of its eventual level, which models suggest may lie
within a range of 0.5 to 2.0 m for 2×CO2 and 1 to 4 m for 4×CO2.
For the first 1,000 years, the 4×CO2 models give 1 to 3 m.

11.5.4.2 Glaciers and ice caps
Melting of all existing glaciers and ice caps would raise sea level
by 0.5 m (Table 11.3). For 1990 to 2100 in IS92a, the projected
loss from land-ice outside Greenland and Antarctica is 0.05 to
0.11  m  (Table  11.12).  Further  contraction  of  glacier  area  and
retreat to high altitude will restrict ablation, so we cannot use the
21st  century  rates  to  deduce  that  there  is  a  time  by  which  all
glacier  mass  will  have  disappeared.  However, the  loss  of  a
substantial  fraction  of  the  total  glacier  mass  is  likely.  The
viability  of  any  particular  glacier  or  ice  cap  will  depend  on
whether  there  remains  any  part  of  it, at  high  altitude, where
ablation  does  not  exceed  accumulation  over  the  annual  cycle.
Areas which are currently marginally glaciated are most likely to
become ice-free.

11.5.4.3 Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
Several modelling studies have been conducted for time periods
of  several  centuries  to  millennia  (Van  de  Wal  and  Oerlemans,
1997; Warner and Budd, 1998; Huybrechts and De Wolde, 1999;
Greve, 2000). A  main  conclusion  is  that  the  ice  sheets  would
continue to react to the imposed climatic change during the next
millennium, even  if  the  warming  stabilised  early  in  the  22nd
century.  Whereas  Greenland  and  Antarctica  may  largely
counteract  one  another  for  most  of  the  21st  century  (Section
11.2.3.4), this situation would no longer hold after that and their
combined contribution would be a rise in sea level.

Greenland ice sheet
The  Greenland  ice  sheet  is  the  most  vulnerable  to  climatic
warming. As  the  temperature  rises, ablation  will  increase.  For
moderate  warming, the  ice  sheet  can  be  retained  with  reduced
extent and modified shape if this results in less ablation and/or a
decrease in the rate of ice discharge into the sea, each of which
currently  account  for  about  half  the  accumulation  (Section
11.2.3). The discharge can be reduced by thinning of the ice sheet
near the grounding line. Ablation can be reduced by a change in
the  area-elevation  distribution.  However, once  ablation  has
increased  enough  to  equal  accumulation, the  ice  sheet  cannot
survive, since discharge cannot be less than zero. This situation
occurs for an annual-average warming of 2.7°C for the present
ice-sheet  topography, and  for  a  slightly  larger  warming  for  a
retreating ice sheet (Huybrechts et al., 1991; see also Oerlemans,

678

Changes in Sea Level

1991; Van de Wal and Oerlemans, 1994). Models show that under
these  circumstances  the  Greenland  ice  sheet  eventually
disappears, except for residual glaciers at high altitudes. By using
the AOGCM  ratios  of  the  Greenland  temperature  to  the  global
average  (Table  11.13)  with  the  results  of  the  calibrated  simple
model (Section 11.5.1.2 and Chapter 9, Section 9.3.3) we project
increases in Greenland temperatures by 2100 of more than 2.7°C
for  nearly  all  combinations  of  SRES  scenarios  and AOGCMs.
The maximum by 2100 is 9°C.

Huybrechts and De Wolde (1999) (Figure 11.16) (see also
Letreguilly et al., 1991) find the Greenland ice sheet contributes
about 3 m of sea level rise equivalent over a thousand years under
their  mid-range  scenario, in  which  the  Greenland  temperature
change  passes  through  4°C  in  2100  before  stabilising  at  5.5°C
after 2130. Taking into account the high-latitude amplification of
warming, this temperature change is consistent with mid-range
stabilisation  scenarios  (Chapter  9, Section  9.3.3.1  and  Figure
9.17(b)). For a warming of 8°C, they calculate a contribution of
about  6  m.  Their  experiments  take  into  account  the  effect  of
concomitant increases in precipitation (which reduces sensitivity)
but  also  of  the  precipitation  fraction  falling  as  rain  (which
strongly  enhances  sensitivity  for  the  larger  temperature
increases). Disregarding the effects of accumulation changes and
rainfall, Greve (2000) reports that loss of mass would occur at a
rate giving a sea level rise of between 1 mm/yr for a year-round
temperature  perturbation  of  3°C  to  as  much  as  7  mm/yr  for  a
sustained warming of 12°C, the latter being an extreme scenario
in which the ice sheet would be largely eliminated within 1,000
years. 

West Antarctic ice sheet
The WAIS contains enough ice to raise sea level by 6 m. It has
received  particular  attention  because  it  has  been  the  most
dynamic part of the Antarctic ice sheet in the recent geological
past, and  because  most  of  it  is  grounded  below  sea  level  –  a
situation that according to models proposed in the 1970s could
lead to flow instabilities and rapid ice discharge into the ocean
when the surrounding ice shelves are weakened (Thomas, 1973;
Weertman, 1974;  Thomas  et  al., 1979).  Geological  evidence
suggests  that WAIS  may  have  been  smaller  than  today  at  least
once  during  the  last  million  years  (Scherer  et  al., 1998).  The
potential  of  WAIS  to  collapse  in  response  to  future  climate
change is still a subject of debate and controversy. 

The discharge of the WAIS is dominated by fast-flowing ice
streams, dynamically constrained at four boundaries: the transi-
tion zone where grounded ice joins the floating ice shelf (Van der
Veen, 1985; Herterich, 1987), the interface of ice with bedrock
that  is  lubricated  by  sediment  and  water  (Blankenship  et  al.,
1986; Anandakrishnan et al., 1998; Bell et al., 1998), the shear
zone  where  fast-moving  ice  meets  relatively  static  ice  at  the
transverse  margins  of  ice  streams  (Echelmeyer  et  al., 1994;
Jacobson and Raymond, 1998), and the ice-stream onset regions
where slowly flowing inland ice accelerates into the ice streams.
Mechanisms have been proposed for dynamic changes at each of
these boundaries.

Early studies emphasised the role of the ice shelf boundary
in  ice  discharge  by  introducing  the  concept  of  a  “back-stress”

believed to buttress the grounded ice sheet and prevent it from
collapsing. Recent work, however, both modelling and measure-
ment, places  greater  emphasis  on  the  other  ice  stream
boundaries.  Force  balance  studies  on  Ice  Stream  B  show  no
evidence  of  stresses  generated  by  the  Ross  ice  shelf, and
mechanical  control  emanates  almost  entirely  from  the  lateral
margins (Whillans and Van der Veen, 1997). If confirmed for the
other Siple Coast ice streams, this suggests ice stream flow fields
to be little influenced by conditions in the ice shelf, similar to the
situation  elsewhere  at  the  Antarctic  margin  (Mayer  and
Huybrechts, 1999).

Nonetheless, there is a considerable body of evidence for ice
stream  variability, and  the  above  analyses  may  not  apply  to
dynamic  situations  involving  large  thinning  or  grounding  line
change.  Ice  Stream  C  largely  stopped  about  a  century  ago
(Retzlaff  and  Bentley, 1993)  and  Ice  Stream  B  decelerated  by
20% within a decade (Stephenson and Bindschadler, 1988). The
mechanisms  for  these  oscillations  are  not  well  understood  and
have been ascribed to processes such as basal water diversion to
a neighbouring ice stream (Anandakrishnan and Alley, 1997) or
thermomechanical  interactions  between  competing  catchment
areas (Payne, 1998). Despite ice stream variability in the latter
model  on  the  millenial  time-scale, the  overall  volume  of  the
WAIS hardly changed, supporting the suggestion that ice streams
may act to remove the imbalance of individual drainage basins
and to stabilise rather than destabilise WAIS (Hindmarsh, 1993).
The  WAIS  was  much  larger  during  the  LGM  and  has
probably  lost  up  to  two  thirds  of  its  volume  since  then
(Bindschadler, 1998).  The  largest  losses  have  been  from
grounding line retreat below the present WAIS ice shelves (Ross
and Filchner-Ronne), most likely as a gradual response to rising
sea levels subsequent to melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice
sheets (Ingolfsson et al., 1998). Local imbalances, both positive
and  negative, are  presently  occurring  (Shabtaie  and  Bentley,
1987;  Whillans  and  Bindschadler, 1988;  Bindschadler  and
Vornberger, 1998;  Hamilton  et  al., 1998;  Rignot, 1998a,b;
Wingham, et al., 1998), but there is no conclusive observational
evidence  (from  monitoring  of  surface  elevation, see  Section
11.2.3.2) that WAIS overall is making a significant contribution
to  global  average  sea  level  change  (Bentley, 1997, 1998a,b;
Bindschadler, 1998; Oppenheimer, 1998; Wingham et al. 1998).
Conway et al. (1999) suggest that grounding line retreat since the
LGM may still be ongoing, giving an average rate of recession
corresponding  to  a  rate  of  sea  level  rise  of  0.9  mm/yr
(Bindschadler, 1998).  If  projected  into  the  future, this  would
imply  disappearance  of  WAIS  in  4,000  to  7,000  years
(Bindschadler, 1998).  However, geological  estimates  of  ocean
volume increase over the last 6,000 years place an upper limit of
about half this amount on global sea level rise (Section 11.3.1).
Recent spectacular break-ups of the Larsen ice shelves in the
Antarctic  Peninsula  (Vaughan  and  Doake, 1996;  Doake  et  al.,
1998) demonstrate the existence of an abrupt thermal limit on ice
shelf  viability  associated  with  regional  atmospheric  warming
(Skvarca  et  al., 1998).  However, the WAIS  ice  shelves  are  not
immediately threatened by this mechanism, which would require
a further warming of 10°C before the −5°C mean annual isotherm
reached  their  ice  fronts  (Vaughan  and  Doake, 1996). Although

Changes in Sea Level

679

atmospheric warming would increase the rate of deformation of
the ice, causing the ice shelf to thin, response time-scales are of
the order of several hundred years (Rommelaere and MacAyeal,
1997; Huybrechts and de Wolde, 1999).

In view of these considerations, it is now widely agreed that
major loss of grounded ice, and accelerated sea level rise, is very
unlikely  during  the  21st  century. An  interdisciplinary  panel  of
international experts applying the techniques of risk assessment
to the future evolution of WAIS concluded that there is a 98%
chance that WAIS will not collapse in the next 100 years, defined
as a change that contributes at least 10 mm/yr to global sea level
change (Vaughan and Spouge, 2001). The probability of a contri-
bution to sea level (exceeding 0.5 m) by the year 2100 was 5%.
These results are broadly consistent with an earlier assessment by
Titus  and  Narayanan  (1996)  based  on  a  US-only  panel, who
found a 5% chance of a 0.16 m contribution and 1% chance of a
0.3 m contribution to sea level rise from WAIS by 2100. We note
that  Vaughan  and  Spouge  also  report  a  probability  of  5%  for
WAIS  giving  a  sea  level  fall  exceeding  0.4  m  within  the  same
time frame, while Titus and Narayanan give 0.18 m.

Nonetheless, on a longer time-scale, changes in ice dynamics
could result in significantly increased outflow of ice into the ice
shelves  and  a  grounding  line  retreat.  Large-scale  models  show
both of these phenomena to be sensitive to basal melting below the
ice shelves (Warner and Budd, 1998; Huybrechts and De Wolde,
1999). Model studies do not agree on the sensitivity of the basal
melting to an oceanic warming: for instance, one shows a quad-
rupling of the basal melting rate below the Amery ice shelf in East
Antarctica for an adjacent sea warming of 1°C (Williams et al.,
1998), while another claims that warmer sea temperatures would
reduce  melting  rates  below  the  Ronne-Filchner  ice  shelves
through  alteration  to  sea-ice  formation  and  the  thermohaline
circulation  (Nicholls, 1997).  Changes  in  open  ocean  circulation
may also play a role. Warner and Budd (1998) suggest that even
for moderate climatic warmings of a few degrees, a large increase
in bottom melting of 5 m/yr becomes the dominant factor in the
longer-term response of the Antarctic ice sheet. In their model, this
causes the demise of WAIS ice shelves in a few hundred years and
would float a large part of the WAIS (and marine portions of East
Antarctica) after 1,000 years. Predicted rates of sea level rise are
between 1.5 and 3.0 mm/yr depending on whether accumulation
rates increase together with the warming. Allowing for runoff in
addition  to  increased  accumulation, Huybrechts  and  De  Wolde
(1999) find a maximum Antarctic contribution to global sea level
rise of 2.5 mm/yr for an extreme scenario involving a warming of
8°C and a bottom melting rate of 10 m/yr. These figures are upper
limits based on results currently available from numerical models,
which  do  not  resolve  ice  streams  explicitly  and  which  may  not
adequately predict the effect of ice shelf thinning on grounding
line retreat owing to physical uncertainties.

Based  on  a  wide-ranging  review, Oppenheimer  (1998)
argues that WAIS could disintegrate within five to seven centuries
following  a  warming  of  only  a  few  degrees.  Such  a  collapse
implies a rate of sea level rise of 10 mm/yr and an average speed-
up of the total outflow by at least a factor of 10 (Bentley, 1997,
1998a,b). However, the majority opinion of a recent expert panel
reported  by  Vaughan  and  Spouge  (2001)  is  that  such  outflow

rates are not attainable. It is, therefore, also plausible that WAIS
may  not  make  a  significant  contribution  to  sea  level  rise  over
time-scales less than a millennium. Vaughan and Spouge (2001)
attribute a 50% probability to the latter scenario, but retained an
equally large probability that the sea level rise will be larger than
2  mm/yr  after  1,000  years, emphasising  the  inadequacy  of  our
current understanding of the dynamics of WAIS, especially for
predictions on the longer time-scales.

Independent of bottom melting below the ice shelves and the
possibility of an ice-dynamic instability, surface melting sets an
upper temperature limit on the viability of the Antarctic ice sheet,
because runoff would eventually become the dominant wastage
mechanism  (as  would  be  the  case  for  Greenland  in  a  climate
several degrees warmer than today). For warmings of more than
10°C, simple runoff models predict that an ablation zone would
develop around the Antarctic coast, making the mass balance at
sea  level  sufficiently  negative  that  the  grounded  ice  would  no
longer be able to feed an ice shelf. Also the WAIS ice shelves
would  disintegrate  to  near  to  their  inland  limits  as  summer
temperatures  rise  above  the  thermal  limit  of  ice  shelf  viability
believed to be responsible for the recent collapse of ice shelves at
the  northern  tip  of  the  Antarctic  Peninsula.  Disintegration  of
WAIS would in that case result, because the WAIS cannot retreat
to  higher  ground  once  its  margins  are  subjected  to  surface
melting and begin to recede (Huybrechts, 1994). Depending on
the strength of the warming, such a disintegration would take at
least a few millennia.

East Antarctic ice sheet
Thresholds for disintegration of the East Antarctic ice sheet by
surface  melting  involve  warmings  above  20°C, a  situation  that
has not occurred for at least the last 15 million years (Barker et
al., 1999), and which is far more than thought possible under any
scenario of climatic change currently under consideration. In that
case, the ice sheet would decay over a period of at least 10,000
years. However, the recent inference of complex flow patterns in
the  interior  of  the  East  Antarctic  ice  sheet  demonstrates  the
existence of ice-streaming features penetrating far inland, which
may be indicative of a more dynamic regime than believed so far
(Bamber et al., 2000; Huybrechts et al., 2000).

11.6 Reducing the Uncertainties in Future Estimates of Sea 

Level Change

It  is  valuable  to  note  that  the  reduction  in  the  uncertainty  of
estimation  of  the  long-term  ice  sheet  imbalance  reported  in
Sections 11.3.1 and 11.4 came from indirect constraints and the
synthesis of information of different types. Such syntheses offer
promise for further progress.

11.6.1 Observations of Current Rates of Global-averaged and 

Regional Sea Level Change

Sections  11.3.2.1  and  11.4  reveal  significant  uncertainty  in  the
analysis  of  20th  century  sea  level  change. Also, we  have  little
knowledge  of  the  regional  pattern  of  sea  level  change.
Observational  determination  of  such  a  pattern  would  be  a

680

Changes in Sea Level

powerful test of the coupled models required for projections of
globally averaged and regional sea level rise. Requirements for
reducing uncertainties include:
•  A  global  tide  gauge  network  (the  ‘GLOSS  Core  Network’)

(IOC, 1997) for measuring relative change. 

• A programme of measurements of vertical land movements at
gauge  sites  by  means  of  GPS  (Global  Positioning  System),
DORIS Beacons and/or absolute gravity meters (Neilan et al.,
1998).

• Improved models of postglacial rebound.
• A reanalysis of the historical record, including allowing for the

impact of variable atmospheric forcing. 

• A subset of mostly island tide gauge stations devoted to ongoing
calibration  of  altimetric  sea  level  measurements  (Mitchum,
1998). 

• An ongoing high-quality (TOPEX/POSEIDON class) satellite
radar  altimeter  mission  (Koblinsky  et  al., 1992)  and  careful
control of biases within a mission and between missions.

•  Space  gravity  missions  to  estimate  the  absolute  sea  surface
topography  (Balmino  et  al., 1996, 1999)  and  its  temporal
changes, to  separate  thermal  expansion  from  an  increase  in
ocean  mass  from  melting  of  glaciers  and  ice  sheets  (NASA,
1996, NRC, 1997) and changes in terrestrial storage. 

For  assessment  of  possible  changes  to  the  severity  of  storm
surges, analyses of historical storm surge data in conjunction with
meteorological  analyses  are  needed  for  the  world’s  coastlines,
including especially vulnerable regions. 

11.6.2 Ocean Processes

Requirements  for  improved  projections  of  ocean  thermal
expansion include:
• Global estimates of ocean thermal expansion through analysis
of  the  historical  data  archive  of  ocean  observations  and  a
programme  of  new  observations, including  profiling  floats
measuring  temperature  and  salinity  and  limited  sets  of  full-
depth repeat oceanographic sections and time-series stations.

• Testing of the ability of AOGCMs to reproduce the observed
three-dimensional and time-varying patterns of ocean thermal
expansion. 

• An active programme of ocean and atmosphere model improve-
ment, with a particular focus on the representation of processes
which transport heat into and within the interior of the ocean.

11.6.3 Glaciers and Ice Caps

Requirements for improved projections of glacier contributions
include (see also Haeberli et al., 1998):
•  A  strategy  of  worldwide  glacier  monitoring, including  the
application of remote sensing techniques (laser altimetry, aerial
photography, high-resolution  satellite  visible  and  infrared
imagery e.g. from ASTER and Landsat).

•  A  limited  number  of  detailed  and  long-term  mass  balance
measurements  on  glaciers  in  different  climatic  regions  of  the
world, with  an  emphasis  on  winter  and  summer  balances  in
order  to  provide  a  more  direct  link  with  meteorological
observations.

• Development of energy balance and dynamical models for more
detailed quantitative analysis of glacier geometry changes with
respect to mass balance and climate change.

• Glacier inventory data to determine the distribution of glacier
parameters such as area and area-altitude relations, so that mass
balance, glacier dynamics and runoff/sea level rise models can
be more realistically framed. 

11.6.4 Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets

• Continued observations with satellite altimeters, including the
upcoming  satellite  laser  altimeter  on  ICESat  and  the  radar
interferometer  on  CRYOSAT.  Measurements  should  be
continued for at least 15 years (with intercalibration between
missions)  to  establish  the  climate  sensitivities  of  the  mass
balance and decadal-scale trends. 

• Satellite  radar  altimetry  and  synthetic  aperture  radar  interfer-
ometry (ERS-1, ERS-2 and Radarsat) for detailed topography,
changes  in  ice  sheet  volume  and  surface  velocity  of  the  ice
sheets  (Mohr  et  al., 1998;  Joughin  et  al., 1999), as  well  as
short-term variability in their flow (Joughin et al., 1996a,b) and
grounding line position (Rignot, 1998a,b,c).

• Determination of the Earth’s time-variant gravity field by the
Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite
flown  concurrently  with  ICESat  to  provide  an  additional
constraint on the contemporary mass imbalances (Bentley and
Wahr, 1998). This could provide estimates of sea level change
to an accuracy of ±0.35 mm/yr.
• Geological  observations  of  sea  level  change  during  recent
millennia combined with improved postglacial rebound models
and  palaeoclimatic  and  palaeoglaciological  studies  to  learn
what changes have occurred in the past.

• Further analysis of Earth rotational parameters in combination

with sea level measurements. 

• Improved  estimates  of  surface  mass  balance  (including  its
spatial  and  temporal  variability)  from  in  situ observations,
accumulation rates inferred from atmospheric moisture budgets
and improved estimates of the rate of iceberg calving and the
melt-water flux.

• Improved  calculation  of  the  surface  mass  balance  within  ice
sheet  models  or  by  atmospheric  models, with  attention  to
modelling of changes in sea-ice concentration because of the
consequent effect on moisture transports and accumulation.

• Improved understanding and modelling of the dynamics of ice
sheets, ice streams and ice shelves (requiring combined studies
using glaciological, oceanographic and satellite observations),
including the physics of iceberg calving.

11.6.5 Surface and Ground Water Storage

Surface and ground water storage changes are thought to be having
a  significant  impact  on  sea  level, but  their  contribution  is  very
uncertain (Table 11.10, Figure 11.9), and could be either positive
or negative. They may become more important in the future, as a
result of changes related not only to climate, but also to societal
decisions that are beyond the scope of this scientific assessment.
There are several general issues in climate-related aspects:

Changes in Sea Level

681

• A more thorough investigative search of historical records could
provide  addition  information  on  ground  water  mining, and
storage in reservoirs. 

•  Accurate  satellite  measurements  of  variations  in  the  Earth’s
gravity (Herring, 1998) to detect changes in land water storage
due to water-table variations and impoundments.

• A better understanding of seepage losses beneath reservoirs and

in irrigation is required.

• A unified systems approach is needed to trace the path of water
more  accurately  through  the  atmosphere, hydrologic, and
biosphere  sub-systems, and  to  account  for  various  feedbacks
(including the use of GCMs and improved hydrologic models).
• Satellite remote sensing offers useful technology for monitoring
the  global  hydrologic  budget. A  cumulative  volume  estimate
for  the  many  small  reservoirs  might  be  possible  using  high-
resolution radar data, targeted ground studies and a classifica-
tion of land use classes from satellite data and also of changes
in deforestation and other land-use transformations (Koster et
al., 1999). 

11.6.6 Summary

Sea  level  change  involves  many  components  of  the  climate
system and thus requires a broad range of research activities. A
more  detailed  discussion  of  the  requirements  is  given  in  the
report of the recent IGBP/GAIM Workshop on sea level changes
(Sahagian and Zerbini, 1999). We recognise that it is important to
assign  probabilities  to  projections, but  this  requires  a  more
critical and quantitative assessment of model uncertainties than is
possible at present.

Changes in Sea Level

Appendix 11.1: Methods for projections of global-average sea level rise

This Appendix describes the methods used in this report to make sea level rise projections for the SRES scenarios for the 21st
century. The results are discussed in Section 11.5.1.2 and shown in Figure 11.12 and Appendix II.
Global-average sea-level rise ∆h(t) is a function of time t and is expressed relative to the level in 1990. It comprises several
components, which are all zero at 1990:

∆h(t) = X(t) + g(t) + G(t) + A(t) + I(t) + p(t) + s(t)

The components are sea-level rise due to:
X thermal expansion.
g loss of mass of glaciers and ice caps.
G loss of mass of the Greenland ice sheet due to projected and recent climate change.
A loss of mass of the Antarctic ice sheet due to projected and recent climate change.
I loss of mass of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets due to the ongoing adjustment to past climate change.
p runoff from thawing of permafrost.
s deposition of sediment on the ocean floor.
The components X, g, G and A are estimated for each of 35 SRES scenarios using the projections of an upwelling-diffusion
energy-balance (UD/EB) model calibrated separately for each of seven AOGCMs (Appendix 9.1).
Thermal expansion X is obtained directly from the thermal expansion Xm(t) projected by the UD/EB model:

X(t) = Xm(t) − Xm(1990)

No uncertainty is included in this term, because the uncertainty is sufficiently represented by the use of a range of AOGCMs.
The term g from glaciers and ice caps is estimated using the global average temperature change Tm(t) projected by the UD/EB
model. First, we obtain the loss of mass gu with respect to the glacier steady state without taking contraction of glacier area into
account.

gu(t) = g1990 +        (T1990 + ∆Tb

+ Tm(t') − Tm(1990))         dt'

t

1990

∂Bg
∂Tg

where g1990 is the sea-level rise from glaciers and ice caps up to 1990 calculated from AOGCM results without contraction of
glacier area, T1990 is the AOGCM global average temperature change at 1990 with respect to the climate of the late 19th century,
∆Tb = 0.15 K the difference in the global average temperature between the late 19th century and the glacier steady state (see
11.5.1.1) and ∂Bg/∂Tg is the sensivity of global glacier mass balance for constant glacier area to global-average temperature
change, expressed as sea level equivalent (from Table 11.11). Second, we estimate the loss of mass  gs with respect to the glacier
steady state taking into account contraction of glacier area. This is done by using an empirical relationship between the loss of
mass for changing and for constant area. The relationship was obtained by a quadratic fit to the AOGCM IS92a results of Section
11.5.1.1.

gs(t) = 0.934gu (t) − 1.165gu (t)

2

for gu and gs in metres. Third, we calculate the change since 1990.

g(t) = gs (t) − gs (1990)

The uncertainty  g(t) on this term is calculated assuming an uncertainty of ±40% (standard deviation) in the mass balance
sensitivities, as discussed in Section 11.5.1.1.

 g(t) = 0.40g(t)

The term G from the Greenland ice sheet is calculated according to

G(t) =        (T1990 + Tm(t') − Tm(1990))          dt'

t

1990

dBG
dTg

where dBG/dTg is the sensitivity of the Greenland mass balance to global-average temperature change, expressed as sea level
equivalent (from Table 11.12). The uncertainty on this term comprises two components, as discussed in Section 11.5.1.1. The
first uncertainty is a mass balance uncertainty

G1(t) =        (T1990 + Tm(t') − Tm(1990))            mG dt'

t ∆TG
∆Tg

1990

where  mG = 0.05 mm/yr/°C and ∆TG/∆Tg is the ratio of Greenland average temperature change to global average temperature
change (from Table 11.12). The first uncertainty is the combination in quadrature of 0.03 mm/yr/°C from ablation parametrization, 

Changes in Sea Level

683

0.03 mm/yr/°C from high-resolution patterns, and 0.02 mm/yr/°C from precipitation changes, as discussed in section 11.5.1.1. 
The second uncertainty is an ice-dynamic uncertainty.

 G2(t) = 0.1G(t)

The term A from the Antarctic ice sheet is calculated according to

A(t) =        (T1990 + Tm(t') − Tm(1990))          dt'

dBA
dTg

t

1990

where dBA/dTg is the sensitivity of the Antarctic mass balance to global-average temperature change, expressed as sea level
equivalent (from Table 11.12). Ice-dynamical uncertainty for the Antarctic is not included and is discussed in Section 11.5.4.3.
There is  no uncertainty for ablation. Precipitation change uncertainty is calculated as discussed in Section 11.5.1.1 according to

A(t) =        (T1990 + Tm(t') − Tm(1990))             mA dt'

t ∆TA
∆Tg

1990

where  mA = 0.08 mm/yr/˚C and ∆TA/∆Tg is the ratio of Antarctic average temperature change to global average temperature
change (from Table 11.12).
The uncertainties on the above terms are combined in quadrature:

hv =    ( g)2 + ( G1)2 + ( G1)2 + ( A)2  

The remaining terms are calculated assuming they contribute to sea-level rise at a constant rate, independent of  AOGCM and
scenario, thus:

I(t) =                 dt'

t dI
dt'

1990

p(t) =                 dt'

t dp
dt'

1990

s(t) =                 dt'

t ds
dt'

1990

The rates each have a range of uncertainty. For dI/dt, this is 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr (Section 11.3.1, Table 11.9), for dp/dt 0 to 0.23 mm/yr
(the upper bound is more precisely 25 mm divided by 110 years, section 11.2.5), for ds/dt 0 to 0.05 mm/yr (Section 11.2.6, Table
11.9). The central rates are 0.25, 0.11 and 0.025 mm/yr for the three terms. We denote I calculated at the minimum rate by Imin
and at the maximum rate by Imax; similarly for p and s. The minimum projected sea-level rise ∆hmin(t) for a given AOGCM and
SRES scenario is given by

and the maximum is

∆hmin(t) = X(t) + g(t) + G(t) + A(t) − 2 hv(t) + Imin(t) + Pmin(t) + smin(t)
∆hmax(t) = X(t) + g(t) + G(t) + A(t) + 2 hv(t) + Imax(t) + Pmax(t) + smax(t)

In these formulae,  hv has been doubled to convert from an uncertainty to a range, following Box 11.1.

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

Executive Summary

The  IPCC  WG1  Second  Assessment  Report  (IPCC, 1996)
(hereafter  SAR)  concluded, “the  balance  of  evidence  suggests
that there is a discernible human influence on global climate”. It
noted that the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate
change  signals  can  only  be  accomplished  through  a  gradual
accumulation  of  evidence.  The  SAR  authors  also  noted
uncertainties in a number of factors, including the magnitude and
patterns  of  internal  climate  variability, external  forcing  and
climate system response, which prevented them from drawing a
stronger conclusion. The results of the research carried out since
1995  on  these  uncertainties  and  other  aspects  of  detection  and
attribution are summarised below. 

A longer and more closely scrutinised observational record
Three of the five years (1995, 1996 and 1998) added to the instru-
mental record since the SAR are the warmest in the instrumental
record of global temperatures, consistent with the expectation that
increases  in  greenhouse  gases  will  lead  to  continued  long-term
warming. The  impact  of  observational  sampling  errors  has  been
estimated for the global and hemispheric mean surface temperature
record and found to be small relative to the warming observed over
the 20th century. Some sources of error and uncertainty in both the
Microwave  Sounding  Unit  (MSU)  and  radiosonde  observations
have been identified that largely resolve discrepancies between the
two  data  sets.  However, current  climate  models  cannot  fully
account  for  the  observed  difference  in  the  trend  between  the
surface and lower-tropospheric temperatures over the last twenty
years even when all known external influences are included. New
reconstructions of the surface temperature record of the last 1,000
years indicate that the temperature changes over the last 100 years
are  unlikely  to  be  entirely  natural  in  origin, even  taking  into
account the large uncertainties in palaeo-reconstructions. 

New model estimates of internal variability
Since  the  SAR, more  models  have  been  used  to  estimate  the
magnitude  of  internal  climate  variability.  Several  of  the  models
used for detection show similar or larger variability than observed
on  interannual  to  decadal  time-scales, even  in  the  absence  of
external  forcing.  The  warming  over  the  past  100  years  is  very
unlikely  to  be  due  to  internal  variability  alone  as  estimated  by
current models. Estimates of variability on the longer time-scales
relevant  to  detection  and  attribution  studies  are  uncertain.
Nonetheless, conclusions  on  the  detection  of  an  anthropogenic
signal  are  insensitive  to  the  model  used  to  estimate  internal
variability  and  recent  changes  cannot  be  accounted  for  as  pure
internal  variability  even  if  the  amplitude  of  simulated  internal
variations is increased by a factor of two or more. In most recent
studies, the  residual  variability  that  remains  in  the  observations
after removal of the estimated anthropogenic signals is consistent
with  model-simulated  variability  on  the  space-  and  time-scales
used for detection and attribution. Note, however, that the power
of the consistency test is limited. Detection studies to date have
shown that the observed large-scale changes in surface tempera-
ture in recent decades are unlikely (bordering on very unlikely) to
be entirely the result of internal variability. 

New estimates of responses to natural forcing
Fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models have used reconstruc-
tions of solar and volcanic forcings over the last one to three
centuries  to  estimate  the  contribution  of  natural  forcing  to
climate variability and change. Including their effects produces
an increase in variance on all time-scales and brings the low-
frequency  variability  simulated  by  models  closer  to  that
deduced  from  palaeo-reconstructions.  Assessments  based  on
physical principles and model simulations indicate that natural
forcing alone is unlikely to explain the increased rate of global
warming  since  the  middle  of  the  20th  century  or  changes  in
vertical temperature structure. The reasons are that the trend in
natural  forcing  has  likely  been  negative  over  the  last  two
decades and natural forcing alone is unlikely to account for the
observed  cooling  of  the  stratosphere.  However, there  is
evidence  for  a  detectable  volcanic  influence  on  climate.  The
available  evidence  also  suggests  a  solar  influence  in  proxy
records  of  the  last  few  hundred  years  and  also  in  the  instru-
mental record of the early 20th century. Statistical assessments
confirm that natural variability (the combination of internal and
naturally forced) is unlikely to explain the warming in the latter
half of the 20th century. 

Improved representation of anthropogenic forcing
Several  studies  since  the  SAR  have  included  an  explicit
representation of greenhouse gases (as opposed to an equivalent
increase  in  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)).  Some  have  also  included
tropospheric  ozone  changes, an  interactive  sulphur  cycle, an
explicit  radiative  treatment  of  the  scattering  of  sulphate
aerosols, and  improved  estimates  of  the  changes  in  stratos-
pheric ozone. While detection of the climate response to these
other anthropogenic factors is often ambiguous, detection of the
influence of greenhouse gas increases on the surface tempera-
ture changes over the past 50 years is robust.

Sensitivity to estimates of climate change signals
Since the SAR, more simulations with increases in greenhouse
gases and some representation of aerosol effects have become
available. In some cases, ensembles of simulations have been
run  to  reduce  noise  in  the  estimates  of  the  time-dependent
response.  Some  studies  have  evaluated  seasonal  variation  of
the  response.  Uncertainties  in  the  estimated  climate  change
signals have made it difficult to attribute the observed climate
change  to  one  specific  combination  of  anthropogenic  and
natural  influences.  Nevertheless, all  studies  since  the  SAR
have found a significant anthropogenic contribution is required
to account for surface and tropospheric trends over at least the
last 30 years.

Qualitative  consistencies  between  observed  and  modelled
climate changes
There  is  a  wide  range  of  evidence  of  qualitative  consisten-
cies between observed climate changes and model responses
to  anthropogenic  forcing, including  global  warming,
increasing  land-ocean  temperature  contrast, diminishing
Arctic sea-ice extent, glacial retreat and increases in precip-
itation in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. Some qualita-

698

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

tive  inconsistencies  remain, including  the  fact  that  models
predict  a  faster  rate  of  warming  in  the  mid-  to  upper
troposphere  which  is  not  observed  in  either  satellite  or
radiosonde tropospheric temperature records. 

A wider range of detection techniques
A major advance since the SAR is the increase in the range
of techniques used, and the evaluation of the degree to which
the  results  are  independent  of  the  assumptions  made  in
applying  those  techniques.  There  have  been  studies  using
pattern  correlations, optimal  detection  studies  using  one  or
more fixed patterns and time-varying patterns, and a number
of  other  techniques.  Evidence  of  a  human  influence  on
climate is obtained using all these techniques. 

Results are sensitive to the range of temporal and spatial
scales  that  are  considered.  Several  decades  of  data  are
necessary  to  separate  the  forced  response  from  internal
variability. Idealised studies have demonstrated that surface
temperature  changes  are  detectable  only  on  scales  greater
than 5,000 km. Studies also show that the level of agreement
found  between  simulations  and  observations  in  pattern
correlation  studies  is  close  to  what  one  would  expect  in
theory.

Attribution studies have applied multi-signal techniques
to  address  whether  or  not  the  magnitude  of  the  observed
response to a particular forcing agent is consistent with the
modelled response and separable from the influence of other
forcing agents. The inclusion of time-dependent signals has
helped  to  distinguish  between  natural  and  anthropogenic
forcing agents. As more response patterns are included, the
problem  of  degeneracy  (different  combinations  of  patterns
yielding  near  identical  fits  to  the  observations)  inevitably
arises. Nevertheless, even with the responses to all the major
forcing  factors  included  in  the  analysis, a  distinct
greenhouse  gas  signal  remains  detectable.  Overall, the
magnitude  of  the  model-simulated  temperature  response  to
greenhouse gases is found to be consistent with the observed
greenhouse  response  on  the  scales  considered.  However,
there  remain  discrepancies  between  the  modelled  and
observed  responses  to  other  natural  and  anthropogenic
factors, and  estimates  of  signal  amplitudes  are  model-
dependent. Most studies find that, over the last 50 years, the
estimated rate and magnitude of warming due to increasing
concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases  alone  are  comparable
with, or  larger  than, the  observed  warming.  Furthermore,
most model estimates that take into account both greenhouse
gases and sulphate aerosols are consistent with observations
over this period.

The  increase  in  the  number  of  studies, the  breadth  of
techniques, increased rigour in the assessment of the role of
anthropogenic forcing in climate, the robustness of results to
the  assumptions  made  using  those  techniques, and  consis-
tency of results lead to increased confidence in these results.
Moreover, to be consistent with the signal observed to date,
the rate of anthropogenic warming is likely to lie in the range
0.1  to  0.2°C/decade  over  the  first  half  of  the  21st  century
under the IS92a (IPCC, 1992) emission scenario.

Remaining uncertainties
A number of important uncertainties remain. These include:

• Discrepancies  between  the  vertical  profile  of  temperature
change  in  the  troposphere  seen  in  observations  and  models.
These  have  been  reduced  as  more  realistic  forcing  histories
have been used in models, although not fully resolved. Also,
the  difference  between  observed  surface  and  lower-tropos-
pheric  trends  over  the  last  two  decades  cannot  be  fully
reproduced by model simulations.

• Large  uncertainties  in  estimates  of  internal  climate  variability
from models and observations, though as noted above, these are
unlikely  (bordering  on  very  unlikely)  to  be  large  enough  to
nullify the claim that a detectable climate change has taken place. 

• Considerable  uncertainty  in  the  reconstructions  of  solar  and
volcanic forcing which are based on proxy or limited observa-
tional  data  for  all  but  the  last  two  decades.  Detection  of  the
influence of greenhouse gases on climate appears to be robust
to possible amplification of the solar forcing by ozone/solar or
solar/cloud interactions, provided these do not alter the pattern
or  time  dependence  of  the  response  to  solar  forcing.
Amplification of the solar signal by these processes, which are
not yet included in models, remains speculative. 

• Large  uncertainties  in  anthropogenic  forcing  are  associated
with the effects of aerosols. The effects of some anthropogenic
factors, including  organic  carbon, black  carbon, biomass
aerosols, and changes in land use, have not been included in
detection  and  attribution  studies.  Estimates  of  the  size  and
geographic pattern of the effects of these forcings vary consid-
erably, although individually their global effects are estimated
to be relatively small.

• Large differences in the response of different models to the same
forcing. These differences, which are often greater than the differ-
ence  in  response  in  the  same  model  with  and  without  aerosol
effects, highlight the large uncertainties in climate change predic-
tion and the need to quantify uncertainty and reduce it through
better observational data sets and model improvement. 

Synopsis
The  SAR  concluded: “The  balance  of  evidence  suggests  a
discernible human influence on global climate”. That report also
noted that the anthropogenic signal was still emerging from the
background  of  natural  climate  variability.  Since  the  SAR,
progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, particularly with
respect  to  distinguishing  and  quantifying  the  magnitude  of
responses to different external influences. Although many of the
sources of uncertainty identified in the SAR still remain to some
degree, new  evidence  and  improved  understanding  support  an
updated conclusion.

• There  is  a  longer  and  more  closely  scrutinised  temperature
record  and  new  model  estimates  of  variability. The  warming
over the past 100 years is very unlikely to be due to internal

variability  alone, as  estimated  by  current  models.
Reconstructions  of  climate  data  for  the  past  1,000  years  also
indicate  that  this  warming  was  unusual  and  is  unlikely  to  be
entirely natural in origin. 

• There are new estimates of the climate response to natural and
anthropogenic forcing, and new detection techniques have been
applied.  Detection  and  attribution  studies  consistently  find
evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate record of the
last 35 to 50 years. 

• Simulations of the response to natural forcings alone (i.e., the
response  to  variability  in  solar  irradiance  and  volcanic
eruptions) do not explain the warming in the second half of the
20th century. However, they indicate that natural forcings may
have contributed to the observed warming in the first half of the
20th century. 

• The  warming  over  the  last  50  years  due  to  anthropogenic
greenhouse  gases  can  be  identified  despite  uncertainties  in
forcing  due  to  anthropogenic  sulphate  aerosol  and  natural
factors  (volcanoes  and  solar  irradiance).  The  anthropogenic
sulphate aerosol forcing, while uncertain, is negative over this
period and therefore cannot explain the warming. Changes in
natural forcing during most of this period are also estimated to
be negative and are unlikely to explain the warming.

• Detection  and  attribution  studies  comparing  model  simulated
changes  with  the  observed  record  can  now  take  into  account

uncertainty in the magnitude of modelled response to external
forcing, in  particular  that  due  to  uncertainty  in  climate
sensitivity.

• Most  of  these  studies  find  that, over  the  last  50  years, the
estimated  rate  and  magnitude  of  warming  due  to  increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases alone are comparable with,
or larger than, the observed warming. Furthermore, most model
estimates  that  take  into  account  both  greenhouse  gases  and
sulphate  aerosols  are  consistent  with  observations  over  this
period.

• The  best  agreement  between  model  simulations  and  observa-
tions over the last 140 years has been found when all the above
anthropogenic and natural forcing factors are combined. These
results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain
the  observed  changes, but  do  not  exclude  the  possibility  that
other forcings may also have contributed.

In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining
uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years
is  likely  to  have  been  due  to  the  increase  in  greenhouse  gas
concentrations.

Furthermore, it is very likely that the 20th century warming
has contributed significantly to the observed sea level rise, through
thermal expansion of sea water and widespread loss of land ice.
Within  present  uncertainties, observations  and  models  are  both
consistent with a lack of significant acceleration of sea level rise
during the 20th century.

12.1 Introduction

12.1.1 The Meaning of Detection and Attribution

The response to anthropogenic changes in climate forcing occurs
against  a  backdrop  of  natural  internal  and  externally  forced
climate variability that can occur on similar temporal and spatial
scales.  Internal  climate  variability, by  which  we  mean  climate
variability not forced by external agents, occurs on all time-scales
from  weeks  to  centuries  and  millennia.  Slow  climate
components, such as the ocean, have particularly important roles
on decadal and century time-scales because they integrate high-
frequency  weather  variability  (Hasselmann, 1976)  and  interact
with faster components. Thus the climate is capable of producing
long  time-scale  internal  variations  of  considerable  magnitude
without  any  external  influences.  Externally  forced  climate
variations may be due to changes in natural forcing factors, such
as solar radiation or volcanic aerosols, or to changes in anthro-
pogenic  forcing  factors, such  as  increasing  concentrations  of
greenhouse gases or sulphate aerosols. 

Definitions
The  presence  of  this  natural  climate  variability  means  that  the
detection  and  attribution  of  anthropogenic  climate  change  is  a
statistical “signal-in-noise” problem. Detection is the process of
demonstrating that an observed change is significantly different
(in a statistical sense) than can be explained by natural internal
variability. However, the detection of a change in climate does
not necessarily imply that its causes are understood. As noted in
the SAR, the unequivocal attribution of climate change to anthro-
pogenic  causes  (i.e., the  isolation  of  cause  and  effect)  would
require  controlled  experimentation  with  the  climate  system  in
which  the  hypothesised  agents  of  change  are  systematically
varied  in  order  to  determine  the  climate’s  sensitivity  to  these
agents.  Such  an  approach  to  attribution  is  clearly  not  possible.
Thus, from  a  practical  perspective, attribution  of  observed
climate  change  to  a  given  combination  of  human  activity  and
natural influences requires another approach. This involves statis-
tical  analysis  and  the  careful  assessment  of  multiple  lines  of
evidence to demonstrate, within a pre-specified margin of error,
that the observed changes are:

• unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;

• consistent with the estimated responses to the given combina-

tion of anthropogenic and natural forcing; and 

• not  consistent  with  alternative, physically  plausible  explana-
tions of recent climate change that exclude important elements
of the given combination of forcings.

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

tial  impact  on  near-surface  temperature  changes  over  the  20th
century. Any statement that a model simulation is consistent with
observed changes can only apply to a subset of model-simulated
variables, such as large-scale near-surface temperature trends: no
numerical model will ever be perfect in every respect. To attribute
all or part of recent climate change to human activity, therefore,
we  need  to  demonstrate  that  alternative  explanations, such  as
pure  internal  variability  or  purely  naturally  forced  climate
change, are unlikely to account for a set of observed changes that
can be accounted for by human influence. Detection (ruling out
that observed changes are only an instance of internal variability)
is  thus  one  component  of  the  more  complex  and  demanding
process of attribution. In addition to this general usage of the term
detection (that some climate change has taken place), we shall
also discuss the detection of the influence of individual forcings
(see Section 12.4). 

Detection and estimation
The basic elements of this approach to detection and attribution
were recognised in the SAR. However, detection and attribution
studies  have  advanced  beyond  addressing  the  simple  question
“have  we  detected  a  human  influence  on  climate?” to  such
questions as “how large is the anthropogenic change?” and “is the
magnitude of the response to greenhouse gas forcing as estimated
in the observed record consistent with the response simulated by
climate models?” The task of detection and attribution can thus be
rephrased  as  an  estimation  problem, with  the  quantities  to  be
estimated being the factor(s) by which we have to scale the model-
simulated response(s) to external forcing to be consistent with the
observed  change.  The  estimation  approach  uses  essentially  the
same tools as earlier studies that considered the problem as one of
hypothesis  testing, but  is  potentially  more  informative  in  that  it
allows  us  to  quantify, with  associated  estimates  of  uncertainty,
how  much  different  factors  have  contributed  to  recent  observed
climate changes. This interpretation only makes sense, however, if
it can be assumed that important sources of model error, such as
missing or incorrectly represented atmospheric feedbacks, affect
primarily the amplitude and not the structure of the response to
external forcing. The majority of relevant studies suggest that this
is the case for the relatively small-amplitude changes observed to
date, but  the  possibility  of  model  errors  changing  both  the
amplitude  and  structure  of  the  response  remains  an  important
caveat.  Sampling  error  in  model-derived  signals  that  originates
from the model’s own internal variability also becomes an issue if
detection and attribution is considered as an estimation problem –
some investigations have begun to allow for this, and one study
has estimated the contribution to uncertainty from observational
sampling and instrumental error. The robustness of detection and
attribution  findings  obtained  with  different  climate  models  has
been assessed. 

Limitations
It  is  impossible, even  in  principle, to  distinguish  formally
between  all  conceivable  explanations  with  a  finite  amount  of
data. Nevertheless, studies have now been performed that include
all  the  main  natural  and  anthropogenic  forcing  agents  that  are
generally accepted (on physical grounds) to have had a substan-

Extensions
It is important to stress that the attribution process is inherently
open-ended, since we have no way of predicting what alternative
explanations for observed climate change may be proposed, and
be accepted as plausible, in the future. This problem is not unique
to  the  climate  change  issue, but  applies  to  any  problem  of

establishing cause and effect given a limited sample of observa-
tions. The possibility of a confounding explanation can never be
ruled out completely, but as successive alternatives are tested and
found to be inadequate, it can be seen to become progressively
more unlikely. There is growing interest in the use of Bayesian
methods (Dempster, 1998; Hasselmann, 1998; Leroy, 1998; Tol
and de Vos, 1998; Barnett et al., 1999; Levine and Berliner, 1999;
Berliner et al., 2000). These provide a means of formalising the
process of incorporating additional information and evaluating a
range  of  alternative  explanations  in  detection  and  attribution
studies.  Existing  studies  can  be  rephrased  in  a  Bayesian
formalism  without  any  change  in  their  conclusions, as
demonstrated  by  Leroy  (1998).  However, a  number  of  statisti-
cians  (e.g., Berliner  et  al., 2000)  argue  that  a  more  explicitly
Bayesian approach would allow greater flexibility and rigour in
the treatment of different sources of uncertainty. 

12.1.2 Summary of the First and Second Assessment Reports

The  first  IPCC  Scientific  Assessment  in  1990  (IPCC, 1990)
concluded  that  the  global  mean  surface  temperature  had
increased by 0.3 to 0.6°C over the previous 100 years and that the
magnitude  of  this  warming  was  broadly  consistent  with  the
predictions  of  climate  models  forced  by  increasing  concentra-
tions of greenhouse gases. However, it remained to be established
that the observed warming (or part of it) could be attributed to the
enhanced greenhouse effect. Some of the reasons for this were
that there was only limited agreement between model predictions
and observations, because climate models were still in the early
stages  of  development;  there  was  inadequate  knowledge  of
natural  variability  and  other  possible  anthropogenic  effects  on
climate and there was a scarcity of suitable observational data,
particularly long, reliable time-series. 

By the time of the SAR in 1995, considerable progress had
been  made  in  attempts  to  identify  an  anthropogenic  effect  on
climate.  The  first  area  of  significant  advance  was  that  climate
models  were  beginning  to  incorporate  the  possible  climatic
effects  of  human-induced  changes  in  sulphate  aerosols  and
stratospheric  ozone. The  second  area  of  progress  was  in  better
defining the background variability of the climate system through
multi-century  model  experiments  that  assumed  no  changes  in
forcing. These provided important information about the possible
characteristics  of  the  internal  component  of  natural  climate
variability. The third area of progress was in the application of
pattern-based  methods  that  attempted  to  attribute  some  part  of
the  observed  changes  in  climate  to  human  activities, although
these studies were still in their infancy at that time. 

The  SAR  judged  that  the  observed  trend  in  global  climate
over the previous 100 years was unlikely to be entirely natural in
origin. This led to the following, now well-known, conclusion:
“Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is
currently  limited  because  the  expected  signal  is  still  emerging
from  the  noise  of  natural  variability, and  because  there  are
uncertainties  in  key  factors.  Nevertheless, the  balance  of
evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on
global climate”. It also noted that the magnitude of the influence
was uncertain.

12.1.3 Developments since the Second Assessment Report

In the following sections, we assess research developments since
the SAR in areas crucial to the detection of climate change and the
attribution of its causes. First, in Section 12.2, we review advances
in  the  different  elements  that  are  needed  in  any  detection  and
attribution study, including observational data, estimates of internal
climate variability, natural and anthropogenic climate forcings and
their simulated responses, and statistical methods for comparing
observed and modelled climate change. We draw heavily on the
assessments in earlier chapters of this report, particularly Chapter
2  − Observed  Climate  Variability  and  Change, Chapter  6  −
Radiative  Forcing  of  Climate  Change, Chapter  8  − Model
Evaluation, and Chapter 9 − Projections of Future Climate Change. 
In Section 12.3, a qualitative assessment is made of observed
and  modelled  climate  change, identifying  general  areas  of
agreement and difference. This is based on the observed climate
changes  identified  with  most  confidence  in  Chapter  2  and  the
model projections of climate change from Chapter 9. 

Next, in  Section  12.4, advances  obtained  with  quantitative
methods for climate change detection and attribution are assessed.
These  include  results  obtained  with  time-series  methods, pattern
correlation  methods, and  optimal  fingerprint  methods.  The
interpretation of optimal fingerprinting as an estimation problem,
finding  the  scaling  factors  required  to  bring  the  amplitude  of
model-simulated changes into agreement with observed changes, is
discussed. Some remaining uncertainties are discussed in Section
12.5 and the key findings are drawn together in Section 12.6.

12.2 The Elements of Detection and Attribution

12.2.1 Observed Data

Ideally, a detection and attribution study requires long records of
observed data for climate elements that have the potential to show
large  climate  change  signals  relative  to  natural  variability.  It  is
also necessary that the observing system has sufficient coverage
so that the main features of natural variability and climate change
can  be  identified  and  monitored.  A  thorough  assessment  of
observed climate change, climate variability and data quality was
presented  in  Chapter  2.  Most  detection  and  attribution  studies
have used near-surface air temperature, sea surface temperature
or upper air temperature data, as these best fit the requirement
above. 

The quality of observed data is a vital factor. Homogeneous
data series are required with careful adjustments to account for
changes  in  observing  system  technologies  and  observing
practices. Estimates of observed data uncertainties due to instru-
ment errors or variations in data coverage (assessed in Chapter 2)
are included in some recent detection and attribution studies. 

There  have  been  five  more  years  of  observations  since  the
SAR. Improvements in historical data coverage and processing
are described in Chapter 2. Confidence limits for observational
sampling  error  have  been  estimated  for  the  global  and
hemispheric mean temperature record. Applications of improved
pre-instrumental proxy data reconstructions are described in the
next two sections.

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

12.2.2 Internal Climate Variability

Detection  and  attribution  of  climate  change  is  a  statistical
“signal-in-noise” problem, it requires an accurate knowledge of
the properties of the “noise”. Ideally, internal climate variability
would be estimated from instrumental observations, but a number
of problems make this difficult. The instrumental record is short
relative to the 30 to 50 year time-scales that are of interest for
detection  and  attribution  of  climate  change, particularly  for
variables  in  the  free  atmosphere.  The  longest  records  that  are
available  are  those  for  surface  air  temperature  and  sea  surface
temperature. Relatively long records are also available for precip-
itation  and  surface  pressure, but  coverage  is  incomplete  and
varies  in  time  (see  Chapter  2).  The  instrumental  record  also
contains  the  influences  of  external  anthropogenic  and  natural
forcing.  A  record  of  natural  internal  variability  can  be
reconstructed by removing estimates of the response to external
forcing  (for  example, Jones  and  Hegerl, 1998;  Wigley  et  al.,
1998a).  However, the  accuracy  of  this  record  is  limited  by
incomplete knowledge of the forcings and by the accuracy of the
climate model used to estimate the response.

Estimates using palaeoclimatic data
Palaeo-reconstructions provide an additional source of informa-
tion on climate variability that strengthens our qualitative assess-
ment  of  recent  climate  change.  There  has  been  considerable
progress  in  the  reconstruction  of  past  temperatures.  New
reconstructions with annual or seasonal resolution, back to 1000
AD, and some spatial resolution have become available (Briffa et
al., 1998; Jones et al., 1998; Mann et al., 1998, 2000; Briffa et
al., 2000; Crowley and Lowery, 2000; see also Chapter 2, Figure
2.21).  However, a  number  of  difficulties, including  limited
coverage, temporal  inhomogeneity, possible  biases  due  to  the
palaeo-reconstruction process, uncertainty regarding the strength
of the relationships between climatic and proxy indices, and the
likely  but  unknown  influence  of  external  forcings  inhibit  the
estimation  of  internal  climate  variability  directly  from  palaeo-
climate  data. We  expect, however, that  the  reconstructions  will
continue  to  improve  and  that  palaeo-data  will  become  increas-
ingly  important  for  assessing  natural  variability  of  the  climate
system. One of the most important applications of this palaeo-
climate data is as a check on the estimates of internal variability
from  coupled  climate  models, to  ensure  that  the  latter  are  not
underestimating the level of internal variability on 50 to 100 year
time-scales (see below). The limitations of the instrumental and
palaeo-records  leave  few  alternatives  to  using  long  “control”
simulations with coupled models (see Figure 12.1) to estimate the
detailed structure of internal climate variability.

Estimates of the variability of global mean surface temperature
Stouffer et al. (2000) assess variability simulated in three 1,000-
year control simulations (see Figure 12.1). The models are found
to simulate reasonably well the spatial distribution of variability
and  the  spatial  correlation  between  regional  and  global  mean
variability, although there is more disagreement between models
at long time-scales (>50 years) than at short time-scales. None of
the  long  model  simulations  produces  a  secular  trend  which  is

comparable to that observed. Chapter 8, Section 8.6.2. assesses
model-simulated variability in detail. Here we assess the aspects
that  are  particularly  relevant  to  climate  change  detection.  The
power  spectrum  of  global  mean  temperatures  simulated  by  the
most  recent  coupled  climate  models  (shown  in  Figure  12.2)
compares  reasonably  well  with  that  of  detrended  observations
(solid black line) on interannual to decadal time-scales. However,
uncertainty of the spectral estimates is large and some models are
clearly  underestimating  variability  (indicated  by  the  asterisks).
Detailed  comparison  on  inter-decadal  time-scales  is  difficult
because observations are likely to contain a response to external
forcings  that  will  not  be  entirely  removed  by  a  simple  linear
trend.  At  the  same  time, the  detrending  procedure  itself
introduces  a  negative  bias  in  the  observed  low-frequency
spectrum. 

Both  of  these  problems  can  be  avoided  by  removing  an
independent estimate of the externally forced response from the
observations  before  computing  the  power  spectrum.  This
independent  estimate  is  provided  by  the  ensemble  mean  of  a
coupled model simulation of the response to the combination of
natural  and  anthropogenic  forcing  (see  Figure  12.7c).  The
resulting spectrum of observed variability (dotted line in Figure
12.2) will not be subject to a negative bias because the observed
data  have  not  been  used  in  estimating  the  forced  response.  It
will, however, be inflated by uncertainty in the model-simulated
forced response and by noise due to observation error and due to
incomplete  coverage  (particularly  the  bias  towards  relatively
noisy Northern Hemisphere land temperatures in the early part
of the observed series). This estimate of the observed spectrum
is therefore likely to overestimate power at all frequencies. Even
so, the  more  variable  models  display  similar  variance  on  the
decadal to inter-decadal time-scales important for detection and
attribution.

Estimates of spatial patterns of variability
Several  studies  have  used  common  empirical  orthogonal
function  (EOF)  analysis  to  compare  the  spatial  modes  of
climate  variability  between  different  models.  Stouffer  et  al.
(2000)  analysed  the  variability  of  5-year  means  of  surface
temperature  in  500-year  or  longer  simulations  of  the  three
models most commonly used to estimate internal variability in
formal  detection  studies.  The  distribution  of  the  variance
between  the  EOFs  was  similar  between  the  models  and  the
observations. HadCM2 tended to overestimate the variability in
the main modes, whereas GFDL and ECHAM3 underestimated
the variability of the first mode. The standard deviations of the
dominant modes of variability in the three models differ from
observations  by  less  than  a  factor  of  two, and  one  model
(HadCM2) has similar or more variability than the observations
in  all  leading  modes.  In  general, one  would  expect  to  obtain
conservative  detection  and  attribution  results  when  natural
variability  is  estimated  with  such  a  model.  One  should  also
expect control simulations to be less variable than observations
because they do not contain externally forced variability. Hegerl
et  al. (2000)  used  common  EOFS  to  compare  50-year  June-
July-August  (JJA)  trends  of  surface  temperature  in  ECHAM3
and HadCM2. Standard deviation differences between models

were  marginally  larger  on  the  50-year  time-scale  (less  than  a
factor of 2.5). Comparison with direct observations cannot be
made on this time-scale because the instrumental record is too
short.

Variability of the free atmosphere
Gillett et al. (2000a) compared model-simulated variability in the
free  atmosphere  with  that  of  detrended  radiosonde  data.  They
found  general  agreement  except  in  the  stratosphere, where
present  climate  models  tend  to  underestimate  variability  on  all
time-scales  and, in  particular, do  not  reproduce  modes  of
variability  such  as  the  quasi-biennial  oscillation  (QBO).  On
decadal  time-scales, the  model  simulated  less  variability  than
observed in some aspects of the vertical patterns important for the
detection  of  anthropogenic  climate  change.  The  discrepancy  is
partially resolved by the inclusion of anthropogenic (greenhouse
gas, sulphate  and  stratospheric  ozone)  forcing  in  the  model.
However, the authors also find evidence that solar forcing plays a
significant role on decadal time-scales, indicating that this should
be taken into account in future detection studies based on changes
in  the  free  atmosphere  (see  also  discussion  in  Chapter  6  and
Section 12.2.3.1 below).

Comparison of model and palaeoclimatic estimates of variability
Comparisons  between  the  variability  in  palaeo-reconstruc-
tions  and  climate  model  data  have  shown  mixed  results  to
date. Barnett et al. (1996) compared the spatial structure of
climate variability of coupled climate models and proxy time-
series for (mostly summer) decadal temperature (Jones et al.,
1998). They found that the model-simulated amplitude of the
dominant  proxy  mode  of  variation  is  substantially  less  than
that  estimated  from  the  proxy  data.  However, choosing  the
EOFs  of  the  palaeo-data  as  the  basis  for  comparison  will
maximise the variance in the palaeo-data and not the models,
and so bias the model amplitudes downwards. The neglect of
naturally forced climate variability in the models might also
be responsible for part of the discrepancy noted in Barnett et
al. (1996) (see also Jones et al., 1998). The limitations of the
temperature  reconstructions  (see  Chapter  2, Figure  2.21),
including for example the issue of how to relate site-specific
palaeo-data  to  large-scale  variations, may  also  contribute  to
this discrepancy. Collins et al. (2000) compared the standard
deviation  of  large-scale  Northern  Hemisphere  averages  in  a
model  control  simulation  and  in  tree-ring-based  proxy  data
for  the  last  600  years  on  decadal  time-scales. They  found  a

Figure 12.2: Coloured lines: power spectra of global mean temperatures in the unforced control integrations that are used to provide estimates of
internal climate variability in Figure 12.12. All series were linearly detrended prior to analysis, and spectra computed using a standard Tukey
window with the window width (maximum lag used in the estimate) set to one-fifth of the series length, giving each spectral estimate the same
uncertainty range, as shown (see, e.g., Priestley, 1981). The first 300 years were omitted from ECHAM3-LSG, CGCM1 and CGCM2 models as
potentially trend-contaminated. Solid black line: spectrum of observed global mean temperatures (Jones et al., 2001) over the period 1861 to 1998
after removing a best-fit linear trend. This estimate is unreliable on inter-decadal time-scales because of the likely impact of external forcing on
the observed series and the negative bias introduced by the detrending. Dotted black line: spectrum of observed global mean temperatures after
removing an independent estimate of the externally forced response provided by the ensemble mean of a coupled model simulation (Stott et al.,
2000b, and Figure 12.7c). This estimate will be contaminated by uncertainty in the model-simulated forced response, together with observation
noise and sampling error. However, unlike the detrending procedure, all of these introduce a positive (upward) bias in the resulting estimate of the
observed spectrum. The dotted line therefore provides a conservative (high) estimate of observed internal variability at all frequencies. Asterisks
indicate models whose variability is significantly less than observed variability on 10 to 60 year time-scales after removing either a best-fit linear
trend or an independent estimate of the forced response from the observed series. Significance is based on an F-test on the ratio observed/model
mean power over this frequency interval and quoted at the 5% level. Power spectral density (PSD) is defined such that unit-variance uncorrelated
noise would have an expected PSD of unity (see Allen et al., 2000a, for details). Note that different normalisation conventions can lead to different
values, which appear as a constant offset up or down on the logarithmic vertical scale used here. Differences between the spectra shown here and
the corresponding figure in Stouffer et al. (2000) shown in Chapter 8, Figure 8.18 are due to the use here of a longer (1861 to 2000) observational
record, as opposed to 1881 to 1991 in Figure 8.18. That figure also shows 2.5 to 97.5% uncertainty ranges, while for consistency with other
figures in this chapter, the 5 to 95% range is displayed here.

factor of less than two difference between model and data if
the  tree-ring  data  are  calibrated  such  that  low-frequency
variability is better retained than in standard methods (Briffa
et al., 2000). It is likely that at least part of this discrepancy
can be resolved if natural forcings are included in the model
simulation.  Crowley  (2000)  found  that  41  to  69%  of  the
variance in decadally smoothed Northern Hemisphere mean
surface  temperature  reconstructions  could  be  externally
forced (using data from Mann et al. (1998) and Crowley and

Lowery  (2000)).  The  residual  variability  in  the  reconstruc-
tions, after subtracting estimates of volcanic and solar-forced
signals, showed  no  significant  difference  in  variability  on
decadal  and  multi-decadal  time-scales  from  three  long
coupled model control simulations. In summary, while there
is substantial uncertainty in comparisons between long-term
palaeo-records of surface temperature and model estimates of
multi-decadal  variability, there  is  no  clear  evidence  of  a
serious discrepancy.

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

Summary
These  findings  emphasise  that  there  is  still  considerable
uncertainty  in  the  magnitude  of  internal  climate  variability.
Various approaches are used in detection and attribution studies
to  account  for  this  uncertainty.  Some  studies  use  data  from  a
number of coupled climate model control simulations (Santer et
al., 1995; Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, North and Stevens, 1998) and
choose the most conservative result. In other studies, the estimate
of  internal  variance  is  inflated  to  assess  the  sensitivity  of
detection and attribution results to the level of internal variance
(Santer et al., 1996a, Tett et al., 1999; Stott et al., 2001). Some
authors  also  augment  model-derived  estimates  of  natural
variability with estimates from observations (Hegerl et al., 1996).
A  method  for  checking  the  consistency  between  the  residual
variability in the observations after removal of externally forced
signals  (see  equation A12.1.1, Appendix  12.1)  and  the  natural
internal  variability  estimated  from  control  simulations  is  also
available (e.g., Allen and Tett, 1999). Results indicate that, on the
scales considered, there is no evidence for a serious inconsistency
between  the  variability  in  models  used  for  optimal  fingerprint
studies and observations (Allen and Tett, 1999; Tett et al., 1999;
Hegerl et al., 2000, 2001; Stott et al., 2001). The use of this test
and  the  use  of  internal  variability  from  the  models  with  the
greatest  variability  increases  confidence  in  conclusions  derived
from optimal detection studies.

12.2.3 Climate Forcings and Responses

The global mean change in radiative forcing (see Chapter 6) since
the  pre-industrial  period  may  give  an  indication  of  the  relative
importance of the different external factors influencing climate
over the last century. The temporal and spatial variation of the
forcing from different sources may help to identify the effects of
individual factors that have contributed to recent climate change. 

The need for climate models
To detect the response to anthropogenic or natural climate forcing
in observations, we require estimates of the expected space-time
pattern  of  the  response.  The  influences  of  natural  and  anthro-
pogenic forcing on the observed climate can be separated only if
the spatial and temporal variation of each component is known.
These patterns cannot be determined from the observed instru-
mental  record  because  variations  due  to  different  external
forcings are superimposed on each other and on internal climate
variations. Hence climate models are usually used to estimate the
contribution  from  each  factor.  The  models  range  from  simpler
energy balance models to the most complex coupled atmosphere-
ocean  general  circulation  models  that  simulate  the  spatial  and
temporal variations of many climatic parameters (Chapter 8). 

The models used
Energy balance models (EBMs) simulate the effect of radiative
climate  forcing  on  surface  temperature.  Climate  sensitivity  is
included as an adjustable parameter. These models are computa-
tionally  inexpensive  and  produce  noise-free  estimates  of  the
climate  signal.  However, EBMs  cannot  represent  dynamical
components  of  the  climate  signal, generally  cannot  simulate

computed  from  model  output  will  necessarily  contain  at  least
some noise from this source, although this can be reduced by the
use  of  ensemble  simulations.  Note  that  different  models  can
produce quite different patterns of response to a given forcing due
to  differences  in  the  representation  of  feedbacks  arising  from
changes  in  cloud  (in  particular), sea  ice  and  land  surface
processes.

The relationship between patterns of forcing and response
There  are  several  reasons  why  one  should  not  expect  a  simple
relationship between the patterns of radiative forcing and temper-
ature response. First, strong feedbacks such as those due to water
vapour and sea ice tend to reduce the difference in the tempera-
ture response due to different forcings. This is illustrated graphi-
cally  by  the  response  to  the  simplified  aerosol  forcing  used  in
early  studies.  The  magnitude  of  the  model  response  is  largest
over the Arctic in winter even though the forcing is small, largely
due  to  ice-albedo  feedback. The  large-scale  patterns  of  change
and their temporal variations are similar, but of opposite sign, to
that  obtained  in  greenhouse  gas  experiments  (Figure  12.3, see
also  Mitchell  et  al., 1995a).  Second, atmospheric  circulation
tends to smooth out temperature gradients and reduce the differ-
ences in response patterns. Similarly, the thermal inertia of the
climate  system  tends  to  reduce  the  amplitude  of  short-term
fluctuations  in  forcing.  Third, changes  in  radiative  forcing  are
more effective if they act near the surface, where cooling to space
is  restricted, than  at  upper  levels, and  in  high  latitudes, where
there  are  stronger  positive  feedbacks  than  at  low  latitudes
(Hansen et al., 1997a). 

In practice, the response of a given model to different forcing
patterns  can  be  quite  similar  (Hegerl  et  al., 1997;  North  and
Stevens, 1998;  Tett  et  al., 1999).  Similar  signal  patterns  (a
condition  often  referred  to  as  “degeneracy”)  can  be  difficult  to
distinguish  from  one  another. Tett  et  al. (1999)  find  substantial
degeneracy between greenhouse gas, sulphate, volcanic and solar
patterns they used in their detection study using HadCM2. On the
other hand, the greenhouse gas and aerosol patterns generated by
ECHAM3 LSG (Hegerl et al., 2000) are more clearly separable,
in part because the patterns are more distinct, and in part because
the aerosol response pattern correlates less well with ECHAM3
LSG’s  patterns  of  internal  variability.  The  vertical  patterns  of
temperature  change  due  to  greenhouse  gas  and  stratospheric
ozone forcing are less degenerate than the horizontal patterns.

Summary
Different models may give quite different patterns of response for
the same forcing, but an individual model may give a surprisingly
similar response for different forcings. The first point means that
attribution studies may give different results when using signals
generated from different models. The second point means that it
may  be  more  difficult  to  distinguish  between  the  response  to
different factors than one might expect, given the differences in
radiative forcing. 

12.2.3.1 Natural climate forcing
Since the SAR, there has been much progress in attempting to
understand  the  climate  response  to  fluctuations  in  solar

luminosity  and  to  volcanism.  These  appear  to  be  the  most
important  among  a  broad  range  of  natural  external  climate
forcings at decadal and centennial time-scales. The mechanisms
of these forcings, their reconstruction and associated uncertain-
ties  are  described  in  Chapter  6, and  further  details  of  the
simulated responses are given in Chapter 8, Section 8.6.3. 

Volcanic forcing
The radiative forcing due to volcanic aerosols from the recent El
Chichon  and  Mt.  Pinatubo  eruptions  has  been  estimated  from
satellite  and  other  data  to  be  −3  Wm−2 (peak  forcing;  after
Hansen  et  al., 1998).  The  forcing  associated  with  historic
eruptions  before  the  satellite  era  is  more  uncertain.  Sato  et  al.
(1993)  estimated  aerosol  optical  depth  from  ground-based
observations  over  the  last  century  (see  also  Stothers, 1996;
Grieser  and  Schoenwiese, 1999).  Prior  to  that, reconstructions
have been based on various sources of data (ice cores, historic
documents  etc.;  see  Lamb, 1970;  Simkin  et  al., 1981;  Robock
and  Free, 1995;  Crowley  and  Kim, 1999;  Free  and  Robock,
1999). There is uncertainty of about a factor of two in the peak
forcing in reconstructions of historic volcanic forcing in the pre-
satellite era (see Chapter 6). 

Solar forcing
The variation of solar irradiance with the 11-year sunspot cycle
has been assessed with some accuracy over more than 20 years,
although measurements of the magnitude of modulations of solar
irradiance between solar cycles are less certain (see Chapter 6).
The estimation of earlier solar irradiance fluctuations, although
based on physical mechanisms, is indirect. Hence our confidence
in the range of solar radiation on century time-scales is low, and
confidence  in  the  details  of  the  time-history  is  even  lower
(Harrison and Shine, 1999; Chapter 6). Several recent reconstruc-
tions  estimate  that  variations  in  solar  irradiance  give  rise  to  a
forcing at the Earth’s surface of about 0.6 to 0.7 Wm−2 since the
Maunder Minimum and about half this over the 20th century (see
Chapter  6, Figure  6.5;  Hoyt  and  Schatten, 1993;  Lean  et  al.,
1995;  Lean, 1997;  Froehlich  and  Lean, 1998;  Lockwood  and
Stamper, 1999). This is larger than the 0.2 Wm−2 modulation of
the 11-year solar cycle measured from satellites. (Note that we
discuss here the forcing at the Earth’s surface, which is smaller
than that at the top of the atmosphere, due to the Earth’s geometry
and albedo.) The reconstructions of Lean et al. (1995) and Hoyt
and  Schatten  (1993), which  have  been  used  in  GCM  detection
studies, vary in amplitude and phase. Chapter 6, Figure 6.8 shows
time-series of reconstructed solar and volcanic forcing since the
late  18th  century.  All  reconstructions  indicate  that  the  direct
effect  of  variations  in  solar  forcing  over  the  20th  century  was
about 20 to 25% of the change in forcing due to increases in the
well-mixed greenhouse gases (see Chapter 6). 

Reconstructions  of  climate  forcing  in  the  20th  century
indicate that the net natural climate forcing probably increased
during the first half of the 20th century, due to a period of low
volcanism  coinciding  with  a  small  increase  in  solar  forcing.
Recent decades show negative natural forcing due to increasing
volcanism, which overwhelms the direct effect, if real, of a small
increase in solar radiation (see Chapter 6, Table 6.13).

warming then. (b) As for (a) but for simulations with volcanic, solar and anthropogenic forcing (greenhouse gases and direct and indirect effects of

effects.

12.2.3.2 Climatic response to natural forcing
Response to volcanic forcing
The  climate  response  to  several  recent  volcanic  eruptions  has
been  studied  in  observations  and  simulations  with  atmospheric
GCMs  (e.g., Robock  and  Mao, 1992, 1995;  Graf  et  al., 1996;
Hansen et al., 1996; Kelly et al., 1996; Mao and Robock, 1998;
Kirchner  et  al., 1999). The  stratosphere  warms  and  the  annual
mean surface and tropospheric temperature decreases during the
two to three years following a major volcanic eruption. A simula-
tion  incorporating  the  effects  of  the  Mt.  Pinatubo  eruption  and
observed  changes  in  stratospheric  ozone  in  addition  to  anthro-
pogenic forcing approximately reproduces the observed stratos-
pheric variations (Figure 12.4; Bengtsson et al., 1999). It shows
stratospheric warming after the volcanic eruption, superimposed
on a long-term cooling trend. Although the surface temperature
response in the Northern Hemisphere warm season following a
volcanic eruption is dominated by global scale radiative cooling,
some  models  simulate  local  warming  over  Eurasia  and  North
America in the cold season due to changes in circulation (e.g.,
Graf et al., 1996; Kirchner et al., 1999). Variability from other
sources  makes  assessment  of  the  observed  climate  response
difficult, particularly as the two most recent volcanic eruptions
(Mt.  Pinatubo  and  El  Chichon)  occurred  in  El  Niño-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) warm years. Simulations with simple models
(Bertrand  et  al., 1999;  Crowley  and  Kim, 1999;  Grieser  and
Schoenwiese, 2001) and AOGCMs (Tett et al., 1999; Stott et al.,
2001)  produce  a  small  decadal  mean  cooling  in  the  1980s  and
1990s due to several volcanic eruptions in those decades. Some
simulations  also  produce  global  warming  in  the  early  20th
century as a recovery from a series of strong eruptions around the
turn of the 20th century. It is unclear whether such a long-term
response is realistic. 

Response to solar forcing
Since the SAR, there have been new modelling and observational
studies on the climate effects of variations in solar irradiance. The
surface temperature response to the 11-year cycle is found to be
small (e.g., Cubasch et al., 1997; White et al., 1997; North and
Stevens, 1998; Crowley and Kim, 1999; Free and Robock, 1999).
Low-frequency solar variability over the last few hundred years
gives  a  stronger  surface  temperature  response  (Cubasch  et  al.,
1997; Drijfhout et al., 1999; Rind et al., 1999; Tett et al., 1999;
Stott et al., 2001). Model results show cooling circa 1800 due to
the hypothesised solar forcing minimum and some warming in the
20th  century, particularly  in  the  early  20th  century.  Time-
dependent experiments produce a global mean warming of 0.2 to
0.5°C  in  response  to  the  estimated  0.7  Wm−2 change  of  solar
radiative forcing from the Maunder Minimum to the present (e.g.,
Lean and Rind, 1998, Crowley and Kim, 1999). 

Ozone changes in the Earth’s atmosphere caused by the 11-
year solar cycle could affect the temperature response in the free
atmosphere. A relation between 30 hPa geopotential and a solar
index has been shown over nearly four solar cycles by Labitzke
and van Loon (1997). Van Loon and Shea (1999, 2000) found a
related  connection  between  upper  to  middle  tropospheric
temperature  and  a  solar  index  over  the  last  40  years, which  is
particularly  strong  in  July  and  August.  Variations  in  ozone
forcing related to the solar cycle may also affect surface temper-
ature  via  radiative  and  dynamical  processes  (see  discussion  in
Chapter 6; Haigh, 1999; Shindell et al., 1999, 2001), but observa-
tional  evidence  remains  ambiguous  (e.g., van  Loon  and  Shea,
2000). The assessment of ozone-related Sun-climate interactions
is uncertain as a result of the lack of long-term, reliable observa-
tions.  This  makes  it  difficult  to  separate  effects  of  volcanic
eruptions  and  solar  forcing  on  ozone.  There  has  also  been

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

709

speculation that the solar cycle might influence cloudiness and
hence surface temperature through cosmic rays (e.g., Svensmark
and Friis-Christensen, 1997; Svensmark, 1998). The latter effect
is difficult to assess due to limitations in observed data and the
shortness of the correlated time-series.

As  discussed  earlier  in  Section  12.2.3, differences  between
the response to solar and greenhouse gas forcings would make it
easier  to  distinguish  the  climate  response  to  either  forcing.
However, the spatial response pattern of surface air temperature
to an increase in solar forcing was found to be quite similar to that
in response to increases in greenhouse gas forcing (e.g., Cubasch
et al., 1997). The vertical response to solar forcing (Figure 12.5)
includes  warming  throughout  most  of  the  troposphere.  The
response  in  the  stratosphere  is  small  and  possibly  locally
negative, but  less  so  than  with  greenhouse  gas  forcing, which
gives tropospheric warming and strong stratospheric cooling. The
dependence of solar forcing on wavelength and the effect of solar
fluctuations  on  ozone  were  generally  omitted  in  these  simula-
tions. Hence, the conclusion that changes in solar forcing have
little  effect  on  large-scale  stratospheric  temperatures  remains
tentative.

The  different  time-histories  of  the  solar  and  anthropogenic
forcing  should  help  to  distinguish  between  the  responses.  All
reconstructions  suggest  a  rise  in  solar  forcing  during  the  early
decades of the 20th century with little change on inter-decadal
time-scales in the second half. Such a forcing history is unlikely
to  explain  the  recent  acceleration  in  surface  warming, even  if
amplified by some unknown feedback mechanism. 

Studies linking forcing and response through correlation
techniques
A number of authors have correlated solar forcing and volcanic
forcing  with  hemispheric  and  global  mean  temperature  time-
series  from  instrumental  and  palaeo-data  (Lean  et  al., 1995;
Briffa et al., 1998; Lean and Rind, 1998; Mann et al., 1998) and
found statistically significant correlations. Others have compared
the simulated response, rather than the forcing, with observations
and found qualitative evidence for the influence of natural forcing
on climate (e.g., Crowley and Kim, 1996; Overpeck et al., 1997;
Wigley et al., 1997; Bertrand et al., 1999) or significant correla-
tions  (e.g., Schönwiese  et  al., 1997;  Free  and  Robock, 1999;
Grieser and Schönwiese, 2001). Such a comparison is preferable
as the climate response may differ substantially from the forcing.
The results suggest that global scale low-frequency temperature
variations are influenced by variations in known natural forcings.
However, these  results  show  that  the  late  20th  century  surface
warming cannot be well represented by natural forcing (solar and
volcanic  individually  or  in  combination)  alone  (for  example
Figures 12.6, 12.7; Lean and Rind, 1998; Free and Robock, 1999;
Crowley, 2000; Tett et al., 2000; Thejll and Lassen, 2000). 

Mann et al. (1998, 2000) used a multi-correlation technique
and found significant correlations with solar and, less so, with the
volcanic  forcing  over  parts  of  the  palaeo-record.  The  authors
concluded that natural forcings have been important on decadal-
to-century time-scales, but that the dramatic warming of the 20th
century  correlates  best  and  very  significantly  with  greenhouse
gas  forcing.  The  use  of  multiple  correlations  avoids  the

possibility  of  spuriously  high  correlations  due  to  the  common
trend  in  the  solar  and  temperature  time-series  (Laut  and
Gunderman, 1998).  Attempts  to  estimate  the  contributions  of
natural  and  anthropogenic  forcing  to  20th  century  temperature
evolution simultaneously are discussed in Section 12.4.

Summary
We conclude that climate forcing by changes in solar irradiance
and  volcanism  have  likely  caused  fluctuations  in  global  and
hemispheric  mean  temperatures.  Qualitative  comparisons
suggest that natural forcings produce too little warming to fully
explain the 20th century warming (see Figure 12.7). The indica-
tion  that  the  trend  in  net  solar  plus  volcanic  forcing  has  been
negative in recent decades (see Chapter 6) makes it unlikely that
natural forcing can explain the increased rate of global warming
since  the  middle  of  the  20th  century.  This  question  will  be
revisited in a more quantitative manner in Section 12.4. 

12.2.3.3  Anthropogenic forcing 
In the SAR (Santer et al., 1996c), pattern-based detection studies
took into account changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases (often
represented by an equivalent increase in CO2), the direct effect of
sulphate aerosols (usually represented by a seasonally constant
change in surface albedo) and the influence of changes in strato-
spheric  ozone.  Recent  studies  have  also  included  the  effect  of
increases  in  tropospheric  ozone  and  a  representation  of  the
indirect  effect  of  sulphate  aerosols  on  cloud  albedo.  Many
models now include the individual greenhouse gases (as opposed
to a CO2 equivalent) and include an interactive sulphur cycle and
an  explicit  treatment  of  scattering  by  aerosols  (as  opposed  to
using prescribed changes in surface albedo). Note that represen-
tation of the sulphur cycle in climate models is not as detailed as
in  the  offline  sulphur  cycle  models  reported  in  Chapter  5.
Detection  and  attribution  studies  to  date  have  not  taken  into
account  other  forcing  agents  discussed  in  Chapter  6, including
biogenic aerosols, black carbon, mineral dust and changes in land
use.  Estimates  of  the  spatial  and  temporal  variation  of  these
factors  have  not  been  available  long  enough  to  have  been
included in model simulations suitable for detection studies. In
general, the neglected forcings are estimated to be small globally
and there may be a large degree of cancellation in their global
mean effect (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.8). It is less clear that the
individual forcings will cancel regionally. As discussed in Section
12.4, this  will  add  further  uncertainty  in  the  attribution  of  the
response to individual forcing agents, although we believe it is
unlikely to affect our conclusions about the effects of increases in
well-mixed greenhouse gases on very large spatial scales. 

Global mean anthropogenic forcing
The largest and most certain change in radiative forcing since the
pre-industrial period is an increase of about 2.3 Wm−2 due to an
increase in well-mixed greenhouse gases (Chapter 6, Figure 6.8
and  Table  6.1).  Radiative  forcing  here  is  taken  to  be  the  net
downward  radiative  flux  at  the  tropopause  (see  Chapter  6).
Smaller, less  certain  contributions  have  come  from  increases  in
tropospheric  ozone  (about  0.3  Wm−2), the  direct  effect  of
increases in sulphate aerosols (about −0.4 Wm−2) and decreases in

Note that the data are annual mean values. The model data are only

in sulphate aerosol are calculated interactively, and changes in
tropospheric ozone were calculated offline using a chemical transport
model. Changes in cloud brightness (the first indirect effect of
sulphate aerosols) were calculated by an offline simulation (Jones et
al., 1999) and included in the model. The changes in stratospheric
ozone were based on observations. The volcanic forcing was based
on the data of Sato et al. (1993) and the solar forcing on Lean et al.
(1995), updated to 1997. The net anthropogenic forcing at 1990 was
1.0 Wm−2 including a net cooling of 1.0 Wm−2 due to sulphate
aerosols. The net natural forcing for 1990 relative to 1860 was 0.5
Wm−2, and for 1992 was a net cooling of 2.0 Wm−2 due to Mt.
Pinatubo. Other models forced with anthropogenic forcing give
similar results to those shown in b (see Chapter 8, Section 8.6.1,
Figure 8.15; Hasselmann et al., 1995; Mitchell et al., 1995b;

stratospheric ozone (about −0.2 Wm−2). There is a very uncertain
and possibly large negative contribution from the indirect effects
of aerosols. Other factors such as that due to increases in fossil
fuel organic carbon, aviation, changes in land use and mineral dust
are very poorly known and not yet incorporated into simulations
used in formal detection studies. Their contribution is generally
believed  to  be  small  relative  to  well-mixed  greenhouse  gases,
though they could be of importance on regional scales.

In  order  to  assess  temperature  changes  over  the  last  two
decades, Hansen et al. (1997b) estimated the net radiative forcing
due  to  changes  in  greenhouse  gases  (including  ozone), solar
variations and stratospheric aerosols from 1979 to 1995 from the
best available measurements of the forcing agents. The negative
forcing  due  to  volcanoes  and  decreases  in  stratospheric  ozone
compensated  for  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  increase  in
greenhouse gas forcing in this period (see Chapter 6, Table 6.13). 

Patterns of anthropogenic forcing
Many of the new detection studies take into account the spatial
variation of climate response, which will depend to some extent
on the pattern of forcing (see also Section 12.2.3). The patterns of
forcing  vary  considerably  (see  Chapter  6, Figure  6.7).  The
magnitude of the overall forcing due to increases in well-mixed
greenhouse gases varies from almost 3 Wm−2 in the sub-tropics
to about 1 Wm−2 around the poles. The warming due to increases
in tropospheric ozone is mainly in the tropics and northern sub-
tropics. Decreases in stratospheric ozone observed over the last
couple of decades have produced negative forcing of up to about
0.5  Wm−2 around  Antarctica.  The  direct  effect  of  sulphate
aerosols  predominates  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  industrial
regions where the negative forcing may exceed 2 Wm−2 locally.

Temporal variations in forcing
Some of the new detection studies take into account the temporal
as  well  as  spatial  variations  in  climate  response  (see  Section
12.4.3.3).  Hence  the  temporal  variation  of  forcing  is  also
important. The forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases (and
tropospheric ozone) has increased slowly in the first half of the
century, and  much  more  rapidly  in  recent  decades  (Chapter  6,
Figure  6.8).  Contributions  from  other  factors  are  smaller  and
more uncertain. Sulphur emissions increased steadily until World
War I, then levelled off, and increased more rapidly in the 1950s,
though not as fast as greenhouse gas emissions. This is reflected
in estimates of the direct radiative effect of increases in sulphate
aerosols. Given the almost monotonic increase in greenhouse gas
forcing  in  recent  decades, this  means  the  ratio  of  sulphate  to
greenhouse gas forcing has probably been decreasing since about
1960 (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.8). This should be borne in mind
when  considering  studies  that  attempt  to  detect  a  response  to
sulphate aerosols. The decreases in stratospheric ozone have been
confined to the last two to three decades.

Uncertainties in aerosol forcing
Some  recent  studies  have  incorporated  the  indirect  effect  of
increases in tropospheric aerosols. This is very poorly understood
(see Chapter 6), but contributes a negative forcing which could be
negligible or exceed 2 Wm−2. The upper limit would imply very

little change in net global mean anthropogenic forcing over the
last  century  although  there  would  still  be  a  quite  strong  spatial
pattern of heating and cooling which may be incompatible with
recent observed changes (see, for example, Mitchell et al., 1995a).
A negligible indirect sulphate effect would imply a large increase
in anthropogenic forcing in the last few decades. There is also a
large  range  in  the  inter-hemispheric  asymmetry  in  the  different
estimates of forcing (see Chapter 6, Table 6.4). Given this high
level of uncertainty, studies using simulations including estimates
of indirect sulphate forcing should be regarded as preliminary. 

Summary
Well-mixed greenhouse gases make the largest and best-known
contribution to changes in radiative forcing over the last century
or  so.  There  remains  a  large  uncertainty  in  the  magnitude  and
patterns  of  other  factors, particularly  those  associated  with  the
indirect effects of sulphate aerosol.

12.2.3.4 Climatic response to anthropogenic forcing
We  now  consider  the  simulated  response  to  anthropogenic
forcing.  Models  run  with  increases  in  greenhouse  gases  alone
give a warming which accelerates in the latter half of the century.
When  a  simple  representation  of  aerosol  effects  is  included
(Mitchell  et  al., 1995b;  Cubasch  et  al., 1996;  Haywood  et  al.,
1997; Boer et al., 2000a,b) the rate of warming is reduced (see
also  Chapter  8, Section  8.6.1).  The  global  mean  response  is
similar  when  additional  forcings  due  to  ozone  and  the  indirect
effect  of  sulphates  are  included.  GCM  simulations  (Tett  et  al.,
1996; Hansen et al., 1997b) indicate that changes in stratospheric
ozone  observed  over  the  last  two  decades  yield  a  global  mean
surface temperature cooling of about 0.1 to 0.2°C. This may be
too  small  to  be  distinguishable  from  the  model’s  internal
variability and is also smaller than the warming effects due to the
changes in the well-mixed greenhouse gases over the same time
period (about 0.2 to 0.3°C). The lack of a statistically significant
surface  temperature  change  is  in  contrast  to  the  large  ozone-
induced  cooling  in  the  lower  stratosphere  (WMO, 1999;
Bengtsson et al. 1999).

The response of the vertical distribution of temperature to
anthropogenic forcing
Increases  in  greenhouse  gases  lead  to  a  warming  of  the
troposphere and a cooling of the stratosphere due to CO2 (IPCC,
1996). Reductions in stratospheric ozone lead to a further cooling,
particularly  in  the  stratosphere  at  high  latitudes. Anthropogenic
sulphate  aerosols  cool  the  troposphere  with  little  effect  on  the
stratosphere. When these three forcings are included in a climate
model (e.g., Tett et al., 1996, 2000) albeit in a simplified way, the
simulated changes show tropospheric warming and stratospheric
cooling, as  observed  and  as  expected  on  physical  principles
(Figure 12.8). Note that this structure is distinct from that expected
from natural (internal and external) influences. 

The response of surface temperature to anthropogenic forcing
The spatial pattern of the simulated surface temperature response
to a steady increase in greenhouse gases is well documented (e.g.,
Kattenberg et al., 1996; Chapter 10). The warming is greater over

land than over ocean and generally small during the 20th century
over  the  Southern  Ocean  and  northern  North  Atlantic  where
mixing extends to considerable depth. The warming is amplified
in high latitudes in winter by the recession of sea ice and snow,
and is close to zero over sea ice in summer. 

Despite the qualitative consistency of these general features,
there is considerable variation from model to model. In Chapter
9, it was noted that the spatial correlation between the transient
response to increasing CO2 in different models in scenarios to the
middle  of  the  21st  century  was  typically  0.65.  In  contrast, the
spatial  correlation  between  the  temperature  response  to
greenhouses gases only, and greenhouse gases and aerosols in the
same model was typically 0.85 (see Chapter 9, Table 9.2). Hence,
attempts to detect separate greenhouse gas and aerosol patterns in
different  models  may  not  give  consistent  results  (see  Section
12.4.3.2).

12.2.4  Some Important Statistical Considerations

Most recent studies (Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, 2000, 2001; North
and Stevens, 1998; Allen and Tett, 1999; Tett et al., 1999, 2000;
Berliner et al., 2000; North and Wu, 2001; Stott et al., 2001) have
used a regression approach in which it is assumed that observa-

tions  can  be  represented  as  a  linear  combination  of  candidate
signals  plus  noise  (see  Appendices  12.1  and  12.2).  Other
approaches, such  as  pattern  correlation  (Santer  et  al., 1995,
1996a;  see  also  Appendix  12.3), complement  the  regression
approach, being  particularly  valuable  in  cases  where  model-
simulated  response  patterns  are  particularly  uncertain.  In  all
cases, the signal patterns are obtained from climate models. In the
regression  approach, the  unknown  signal  amplitudes  are
estimated from observations. The uncertainty of these estimates
that  is  caused  by  natural  variability  in  the  observations  is
expressed with confidence intervals. Detection of an individual
signal is achieved when the confidence interval for its amplitude
does  not  include  zero.  Overall  detection  (that  some  climate
change  has  taken  place)  is  achieved  when  the  joint  confidence
interval on the signals considered does not encompass the origin.

Attribution and consistency
Detecting  that  some  climate  change  has  taken  place  does  not
immediately  imply  that  we  know  the  cause  of  the  detected
change. The practical approach to attribution that has been taken
by climatologists includes a demand for consistency between the
signal  amplitudes  projected  by  climate  models  and  estimated
from  observations  (Hasselmann, 1997).  Consequently, several

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

713

studies, including Hegerl et al. (1997, 2000) and Tett et al. (1999,
2000)  have  performed  an  “attribution” consistency  test  that  is
designed  to  detect  inconsistency  between  observed  and  model
projected  signal  amplitudes.  This  test  is  a  useful  adjunct  to
detection because it provides an objective means of identifying
model-simulated signal amplitudes that are significantly different
from those estimated from observations. However, the test does
not give the final word on attribution because it is designed to
identify  evidence  of  inconsistency  rather  than  evidence  for
consistency between modelled and observed estimates of signal
strength.  A  further  refinement  (e.g., Stott  et  al., 2001)  is  to
consider the full range of signals believed, on physical grounds,
to  be  likely  to  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  recent  climate
change  and  to  identify  those  subsets  of  these  signals  that  are
consistent with recent observations. If all these subsets contain an
anthropogenic component, for example, then at least part of the
observed  change  can  be  attributed  to  anthropogenic  influence.
Levine and Berliner (1999) point out that a test that searches for
consistency is available (Brown et al., 1995), but it has not yet
been used in attribution studies. Bayesian statisticians approach
the problem more directly by estimating the posterior probability
that the signal amplitudes projected by climate models are close
to those in the observed climate. Berliner et al. (2000) provides a
demonstration.

The use of climate models to estimate natural internal variability
Climate models play a critical role in these studies because they
provide  estimates  of  natural  internal  variability  as  well  as  the
signals. In most studies an estimate of natural internal variability
is needed to optimise the search for the signal and this is usually
obtained from a long control simulation. In addition, a separate
estimate  of  natural  variability  is  required  to  determine  the
uncertainty of the amplitude estimates. Unfortunately, the short
instrumental record gives only uncertain estimates of variability
on the 30 to 50 year time-scales that are important for detection
and  attribution  and  palaeo-data  presently  lacks  the  necessary
spatial  coverage  (see  Section  12.2.2).  Thus  a  second  control
integration  is  generally  used  to  estimate  the  uncertainty  of  the
amplitude  estimates  that  arises  from  natural  climate  variability
(e.g., Hegerl et al., 1996; Tett et al., 1999). 

Fixed and temporally-varying response patterns
Detection and attribution studies performed up to the SAR used
fixed signal patterns that did not evolve with time. These studies
were hampered because the mean large-scale response of climate
to different types of anomalous forcing tends to be similar (e.g.,
Mitchell et al., 1995a; Reader and Boer, 1998; see also Figure
12.3). Recent studies have been able to distinguish more clearly
between  signals  from  anthropogenic  and  other  sources  by
including information from climate models about their temporal
evolution. Tett et al. (1999, 2000) and Stott et al. (2001) in related
studies  have  used  a  space-time approach  in  which  the  signal
pattern evolves on the decadal time-scale over a 50-year period.
North and Wu (2001) also use a space-time approach. North and
Stevens  (1998)  used  a  related  space-frequency approach  (see
Appendix 12.2). 

Allowance for noise in signal patterns
Most  studies  have  assumed  that  signal  patterns  are  noise  free.
This  is  a  reasonable  assumption  for  fixed  pattern  studies  (see
Appendix  12.2)  but  space-time  estimates  of  the  20th  century
climate change obtained from small ensembles of forced climate
simulations are contaminated by the model’s internal variability.
Allen and Tett (1999) point out that noise in the signal patterns
will  tend  to  make  the  standard  detection  algorithm  (e.g.,
Hasselmann, 1993, 1997)  somewhat  conservative.  Methods  for
accommodating this source of noise have been available for more
than a century (Adcock, 1878; see also Ripley and Thompson,
1987). Allen and Stott (2000) recently applied such a method and
found that, while the question of which signals could be detected
was generally unaffected, the estimated amplitude of individual
signals  was  sensitive  to  this  modification  of  the  procedure.
Another  source  of  uncertainty  concerns  differences  in  signal
patterns between different models. Recent studies (Allen et al.,
2000a,b; Barnett et al., 2000; Hegerl et al., 2000) consider the
sensitivity of detection and attribution results to these differences. 

12.3 Qualitative Comparison of Observed and Modelled 

Climate Change 

12.3.1 Introduction

Temporal and spatial scales used in detection studies
While  a  growing  number  of  long  control  simulations  are
becoming available, there remain limitations on the spatial scales
that  can  be  included  in  global  scale  detection  and  attribution
studies. Present day control simulations, which range from 300 to
about 2,000 years in length, are not long enough to simultane-
ously estimate internal variability on the 30 to 50 year time-scale
over a broad range of spatial scales.  Consequently, detection and
attribution studies are conducted in a reduced space that includes
only  large  spatial  scales.  This  space  is  selected  so  that  it
represents  the  signals  well  and  allows  reliable  estimation  of
internal  variability  on  the  scales  retained  (see Appendix  12.4).
Recently, the scale selection process has been augmented with a
statistical procedure that checks for consistency between model
simulated and observed variability on the scales that are retained
(Allen and Tett, 1999).

This  section  presents  a  qualitative  assessment  of  consistencies
and inconsistencies between the observed climate changes identi-
fied in Chapter 2 and model projections of anthropogenic climate
change described in Chapter 9. 

Most formal detection and attribution studies concentrate on
variables  with  high  climate  change  signal-to-noise  ratios, good
observational data coverage, and consistent signals from different
model simulations, mainly using mean surface air temperatures
or zonal mean upper-air temperatures. To enhance the signal-to-
noise  ratio, they  generally  consider  variations  on  large  spatial
scales and time-scales of several decades or longer.

There are many studies that have identified areas of qualita-
tive  consistency  and  inconsistency  between  observed  and
modelled  climate  change.  While  the  evidence  for  an  anthro-
pogenic influence on climate from such studies is less compelling
than from formal attribution studies, a broad range of evidence of

714

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

qualitative consistency between observed and modelled climate
change is also required. In addition, areas of qualitative consis-
tency may suggest the possibility for further formal detection and
attribution study. 

12.3.2 Thermal Indicators

Surface temperature
Global  mean  surface  air  temperature  has  been  used  in  many
climate  change  detection  studies.  The  warming  shown  in  the
instrumental observations over the last 140 years is larger than that
over  a  comparable  period  in  any  of  the  multi-century  control
simulations carried out to date (e.g., Figure 12.1; Stouffer et al.,
2000). If the real world internal variability on this time-scale is no
greater than that of the models, then the temperature change over
the  last  140  years  has  been  unusual  and  therefore  likely  to  be
externally forced. This is supported by palaeo-reconstructions of
the last six centuries (Mann et al., 1998) and the last 1,000 years
(Briffa  et  al., 1998;  2000;  Jones  et  al., 1998;  Crowley, 2000;
Crowley and Lowery, 2000; Mann et al., 2000), which show that
the  20th  century  warming  is  highly  unusual.  Three  of  the  five
years  (1995, 1996  and  1998)  added  to  the  instrumental  record
since the SAR are the warmest globally in the instrumental record,
consistent with the expectation that increases in greenhouse gases
will lead to sustained long-term warming.

When anthropogenic factors are included, models provide a
plausible explanation of the changes in global mean temperature
over the last hundred years (Figure 12.7). It is conceivable that
this agreement between models and observations is spurious. For
example, if a model’s response to greenhouse gas increases is too
large (small) and the sulphate aerosol forcing too large (small),
these errors could compensate. Differences in the spatio-temporal
patterns  of  response  to  greenhouse  gases  and  sulphate  forcing
nevertheless  allow  some  discrimination  between  them, so  this
compensation is not complete. On the other hand, when forced
with known natural forcings, models produce a cooling over the
second half of the 20th century (see Figure 12.7) rather than the
warming trend shown in the observed record. The discrepancy is
too  large  to  be  explained  through  model  estimates  of  internal
variability  and  unlikely  to  be  explained  through  uncertainty  in
forcing  history  (Tett  et  al., 2000).  Schneider  and  Held  (2001)
applied  a  technique  to  isolate  those  spatial  patterns  of  decadal
climate  change  in  observed  surface  temperature  data  over  the
20th century which are most distinct from interannual variability.
They find a spatial pattern which is similar to model-simulated
greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol fingerprints in both July and
December.  The  time  evolution  of  this  pattern  shows  a  strong
trend  with  little  influence  of  interannual  variability.  (Note  that
this technique is related to optimal fingerprinting, but does not
use prior information on the pattern of expected climate change.)

Other thermal indicators
While most attention in formal detection and attribution studies
has been paid to mean surface air temperatures, a number of other
thermal  indicators  of  climate  variations  are  also  discussed  in
Chapter 2. Many of these, including warming in sub-surface land
temperatures measured in bore holes, warming indicators in ice

cores  and  corresponding  bore  holes, warming  in  sub-surface
ocean temperatures, retreat of glaciers, and reductions in Arctic
sea-ice extent and in snow cover, are consistent with the recent
observed  warming  in  surface  air  temperatures  and  with  model
projections of the response to increasing greenhouse gases. Other
observed changes in thermal indicators include a reduction in the
mean annual cycle (winters warming faster than summers) and in
the mean diurnal temperature range (nights warming faster than
days)  over  land  (see  Chapter  2).  While  the  changes  in  annual
cycle are consistent with most model projections, the observed
changes in diurnal temperature range are larger than simulated in
most models for forcings due to increasing greenhouse gases and
sulphate aerosols this century (see Chapters 2 and 8). However,
the spatial and temporal coverage of data for changes in observed
diurnal  temperature  range  is  less  than  for  changes  in  mean
temperatures, leading  to  greater  uncertainty  in  the  observed
global  changes  (Karoly  and  Braganza, 2001;  Schnur, 2001).
Also, the  observed  reductions  in  diurnal  temperature  range  are
associated with increases in cloudiness (see Chapter 2), which are
not simulated well by models. Few models include the indirect
effects of sulphate aerosols on clouds. 

Changes  in  sea-ice  cover  and  snow  cover  in  the  transition
seasons  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  are  consistent  with  the
observed  and  simulated  high  latitude  warming.  The  observed
trends  in  Northern  Hemisphere  sea-ice  cover  (Parkinson  et  al.,
1999) are consistent with those found in climate model simula-
tions  of  the  last  century  including  anthropogenic  forcing
(Vinnikov  et  al., 1999).  Sea-ice  extent  in  the  Southern
Hemisphere does not show any consistent trends.

Compatibility of surface and free atmosphere temperature trends
There  is  an  overall  consistency  in  the  patterns  of  upper  air
temperature  changes  with  those  expected  from  increasing
greenhouse  gases  and  decreasing  stratospheric  ozone  (tropo-
spheric warming and stratospheric cooling). It is hard to explain
the observed changes in the vertical in terms of natural forcings
alone, as  discussed  in  Section  12.2.3.2  (see  Figure  12.8).
However, there are some inconsistencies between the observed
and  modelled  vertical  patterns  of  temperature  change.
Observations indicate that, over the last three to four decades, the
tropical atmosphere has warmed in the layer up to about 300 hPa
and cooled above (Parker et al., 1997; Gaffen et al., 2000). Model
simulations of the recent past produce a warming of the tropical
atmosphere to about 200 hPa, with a maximum at around 300 hPa
not  seen  in  the  observations.  This  discrepancy  is  less  evident
when co-located model and radiosonde data are used (Santer et
al., 2000), or if volcanic forcing is taken into account, but does
not  go  away  entirely  (Bengtsson  et  al., 1999;  Brown  et  al.,
2000b). The MSU satellite temperature record is too short and
too poorly resolved in the vertical to be of use here.

Comparison  of  upper  air  and  surface  temperature  data  in
Chapter 2 shows that the lower to mid-troposphere has warmed
less than the surface since 1979. The satellite-measured tempera-
ture over a broad layer in the lower troposphere around 750 hPa
since 1979 shows no significant trend, in contrast to the warming
trend  measured  over  the  same  time  period  at  the  surface.  This
disparity  has  been  assessed  recently  by  a  panel  of  experts

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

715

(National Academy of Sciences, 2000). They concluded that “the
troposphere actually may have warmed much less rapidly than the
surface from 1979 to the late 1990s, due both to natural causes
(e.g., the sequence of volcanic eruptions that occurred within this
particular 20-year period) and human activities (e.g., the cooling
in  the  upper  troposphere  resulting  from  ozone  depletion  in  the
stratosphere)” (see also Santer et al., 2000). They also concluded
that “it is not currently possible to determine whether or not there
exists a fundamental discrepancy between modelled and observed
atmospheric temperature changes since the advent of satellite data
in 1979”. Over the last 40 years, observed warming trends in the
lower troposphere and at the surface are similar, indicating that the
lower troposphere warmed faster than the surface for about two
decades prior to 1979 (Brown et al., 2000a; Gaffen et al., 2000).
However, in  the  extra-tropical  Eurasian  winter  some  additional
warming of the surface relative to the lower or mid-troposphere
might  be  expected  since  1979.  This  is  due  to  an  overall  trend
towards  an  enhanced  positive  phase  of  the  Arctic  Oscillation
(Thompson et al., 2000) which has this signature.

Model simulations of large-scale changes in tropospheric and
surface temperatures are generally statistically consistent with the
observed changes (see Section 12.4). However, models generally
predict  an  enhanced  rate  of  warming  in  the  mid-  to  upper
troposphere  over  that  at  the  surface  (i.e., a  negative  lapse-rate
feedback  on  the  surface  temperature  change)  whereas  observa-
tions  show  mid-tropospheric  temperatures  warming  no  faster
than surface temperatures. It is not clear whether this discrepancy
arises  because  the  lapse-rate  feedback  is  consistently  over-
represented in climate models or because of other factors such as
observational  error  or  neglected  forcings  (Santer  et  al., 2000).
Note  that  if  models  do  simulate  too  large  a  negative  lapse-rate
feedback, they  will  tend  to  underestimate  the  sensitivity  of
climate to a global radiative forcing perturbation. 

Stratospheric trends
A  recent  assessment  of  temperature  trends  in  the  stratosphere
(Chanin and Ramaswamy, 1999) discussed the cooling trends in
the lower stratosphere described in Chapter 2. It also identified
large cooling trends in the middle and upper stratosphere, which
are  consistent  with  anthropogenic  forcing  due  to  stratospheric
ozone  depletion  and  increasing  greenhouse  gas  concentrations.
An increase in water vapour, possibly due to increasing methane
oxidation, is another plausible explanation for the lower strato-
spheric cooling (Forster and Shine, 1999) but global stratospheric
water vapour trends are poorly understood.

12.3.3 Hydrological Indicators

As discussed in Chapter 2, there is less confidence in observed
variations in hydrological indicators than for surface temperature,
because of the difficulties in taking such measurements and the
small-scale  variations  of  precipitation. There  is  general  consis-
tency between the changes in mean precipitation in the tropics
over  the  last  few  decades  and  changes  in  ENSO.  There  is  no
general consistency between observed changes in mean tropical
precipitation and model simulations. In middle and high latitudes
in the Northern Hemisphere, the observed increase in precipita-

tion  is  consistent  with  most  model  simulations.  Observed
changes  in  ocean  salinity  in  the  Southern  Ocean  appear  to  be
consistent  with  increased  precipitation  there, as  expected  from
model simulations (Wong et al., 1999; Banks et al., 2000).

The observed increases in the intensity of heavy precipitation
in  the  tropics  and  in  convective  weather  systems  described  in
Chapter 2 are consistent with moist thermodynamics in a warmer
atmosphere and model simulations. Observed increases of water
vapour in the lower troposphere in regions where there is adequate
data  coverage  are  also  consistent  with  model  simulations.  As
discussed  in  Chapter  7, different  theories  suggest  opposite
variations  of  water  vapour  in  the  upper  troposphere  associated
with  an  increased  greenhouse  effect  and  surface  warming.  The
quality, amount and coverage of water vapour data in the upper
troposphere do not appear to be sufficient to resolve this issue.

12.3.4  Circulation

In middle and high latitudes of both hemispheres, there has been
a trend over the last few decades towards one phase of the North
Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation and of the Antarctic high
latitude  mode, sometimes  also  referred  to  as  “annular  modes”,
(Chapter  2;  Thompson  et  al., 2000).  These  are  approximately
zonally  symmetric  modes  of  variability  of  the  atmospheric
circulation.  Both  trends  have  been  associated  with  reduced
surface  pressure  at  high  latitudes, stronger  high  latitude  jets, a
stronger polar vortex in the winter lower stratosphere and, in the
Northern Hemisphere, winter warming over the western parts of
the  continents  associated  with  increased  warm  advection  from
ocean regions. The trend is significant and cannot be explained
by  internal  variability  in  some  models  (Gillett  et  al., 2000b).
These  dynamical  changes  explain  only  part  of  the  observed
Northern Hemisphere warming (Gillett et al., 2000b; Thompson
et  al., 2000).  Modelling  studies  suggest  a  number  of  possible
causes  of  these  circulation  changes, including  greenhouse  gas
increases (Fyfe  et  al., 1999; Paeth  et  al., 1999; Shindell  et  al.,
1999)  and  stratospheric  ozone  decreases  (Graf  et  al., 1998;
Volodin  and  Galin, 1999).  Some  studies  have  also  shown  that
volcanic  eruptions  (Graf  et  al., 1998;  Mao  and  Robock, 1998;
Kirchner et al., 1999) can induce such changes in circulation on
interannual  time-scales.  Shindell  et  al. (2001)  show  that  both
solar  and  volcanic  forcing  are  unlikely  to  explain  the  recent
trends in the annular modes. 

The  majority  of  models  simulate  the  correct  sign  of  the
observed  trend  in  the  North Atlantic  or Arctic  Oscillation  when
forced  with  anthropogenic  increases  in  greenhouse  gases  and
sulphate aerosols, but almost all underestimate the magnitude of
the trend (e.g., Osborn et al., 1999; Gillett et al., 2000b; Shindell et
al., 1999). Some studies suggest that a better resolved stratosphere
is  necessary  to  simulate  the  correct  magnitude  of  changes  in
dynamics involving the annular modes (e.g., Shindell et al., 2001).

12.3.5 Combined Evidence

The combination of independent but consistent evidence should
strengthen  our  confidence  in  identifying  a  human  influence  on
climate. The physical and dynamical consistency of most of the

716

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

thermal and hydrological changes described above supports this
conclusion. However, it is important to bear in mind that much of
this evidence is associated with a global and regional pattern of
warming  and  therefore  cannot  be  considered  to  be  completely
independent evidence. 

An elicitation of individual experts’ subjective assessment
of  evidence  for  climate  change  detection  and  attribution  is
being carried out (Risbey et al., 2000). This will help to better
understand the nature of the consensus amongst experts on the
subject of climate change attribution. 

12.4 Quantitative Comparison of Observed and Modelled 

Climate Change

A major advance since the SAR has been the increase in the
range of techniques used to assess the quantitative agreement
between  observed  and  modelled  climate  change, and  the
evaluation of the degree to which the results are independent
of the assumptions made in applying those techniques (Table
12.1).  Also, some  studies  have  based  their  conclusions  on
estimates  of  the  amplitude  of  anthropogenic  signals  in  the
observations  and  consideration  of  their  consistency  with
model projections. Estimates of the changes in forcing up to
1990 used in these studies, where available, are given in Table
12.2. In this section we assess new studies using a number of
techniques, ranging  from  descriptive  analyses  of  simple
indices  to  sophisticated  optimal  detection  techniques  that
incorporate the time and space-dependence of signals over the
20th century. 

We  begin  in  Section  12.4.1  with  a  brief  discussion  of
detection  studies  that  use  simple  indices  and  time-series
analyses. In Section 12.4.2 we discuss recent pattern correla-
tion studies (see Table 12.1) that assess the similarity between
observed  and  modelled  climate  changes.  Pattern  correlation
studies  were  discussed  extensively  in  the  SAR, although
subsequently they received some criticism. We therefore also
consider  the  criticism  and  studies  that  have  evaluated  the
performance  of  pattern  correlation  techniques.  Optimal
detection  studies  of  various  kinds  are  assessed  in  Section
12.4.3. We consider first studies that use a single fixed spatial
signal pattern (Section 12.4.3.1) and then studies that simul-
taneously  incorporate  more  than  one  fixed  signal  pattern
(Section 12.4.3.2). Finally, optimal detection studies that take
into account temporal as well as spatial variations (so-called
space-time techniques) are assessed in Section 12.4.3.3. 

We provide various aids to the reader to clarify the distinc-
tion between the various detection and attribution techniques
that  have  been  used.  Box  12.1  in  Section  12.4.3  provides  a
simple  intuitive  description  of  optimal  detection.  Appendix
12.1 provides a more technical description and relates optimal
detection  to  general  linear  regression.  The  differences
between  fixed  pattern, space-time  and  space-frequency
optimal detection methods are detailed in Appendix 12.2 and
the  relationship  between  pattern  correlation  and  optimal
detection methods is discussed in Appendix 12.3. Dimension
reduction, a  necessary  part  of  optimal  detection  studies, is
discussed in Appendix 12.4.

12.4.1 Simple Indices and Time-series Methods

An index used in many climate change detection studies is global
mean  surface  temperature, either  as  estimated  from  the  instru-
mental record of the last 140 years, or from palaeo-reconstruc-
tions. Some studies of the characteristics of the global mean and
its relationship to forcing indices are assessed in Section 12.2.3.
Here  we  consider  briefly  some  additional  studies  that  examine
the spatial structure of observed trends or use more sophisticated
time-series analysis techniques to characterise the behaviour of
global, hemispheric and zonal mean temperatures. 

Spatial patterns of trends in surface temperature
An  extension  of  the  analysis  of  global  mean  temperature  is  to
compare the spatial structure of observed trends (see Chapter 2,
Section  2.2.2.4)  with  those  simulated  by  models  in  coupled
control  simulations.  Knutson  et  al. (2000)  examined  observed
1949  to  1997  surface  temperature  trends  and  found  that  over
about half the globe they are significantly larger than expected
from  natural  low-frequency  internal  variability  as  simulated  in
long control simulations with the GFDL model (Figure 12.9). A
similar result was obtained by Boer et al. (2000a) using 1900 to
1995  trends.  The  level  of  agreement  between  observed  and
simulated  trends  increases  substantially  in  both  studies  when
observations  are  compared  with  simulations  that  incorporate
transient greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosol forcing (compare
Figure 12.9c with Figure 12.9d, see also Chapter 8, Figure 8.18).
While there are areas, such as the extra-tropical Pacific and North
Atlantic  Ocean, where  the  GFDL  model  warms  significantly
more than has been observed, the anthropogenic climate change
simulations  do  provide  a  plausible  explanation  of  temperature
trends  over  the  last  century  over  large  areas  of  the  globe.
Delworth and Knutson (2000) find that one in five of their anthro-
pogenic climate change simulations showed a similar evolution
of global mean surface temperature over the 20th century to that
observed, with strong warming, particularly in the high latitude
North Atlantic, in the first half of the century. This would suggest
that  the  combination  of  anthropogenic  forcing  and  internal
variability may be sufficient to account for the observed early-
century  warming  (as  suggested  by, e.g., Hegerl  et  al., 1996),
although other recent studies have suggested that natural forcing
may  also  have  contributed  to  the  early  century  warming  (see
Section 12.4.3).

Correlation structures in surface temperature
Another extension is to examine the lagged and cross-correlation
structure of observed and simulated hemispheric mean tempera-
ture  as  in  Wigley  et  al., (1998a).  They  find  large  differences
between the observed and model correlation structure that can be
explained by accounting for the combined influences of anthro-
pogenic and solar forcing and internal variability in the observa-
tions.  Solar  forcing  alone  is  not  found  to  be  a  satisfactory
explanation  for  the  discrepancy  between  the  correlation
structures  of  the  observed  and  simulated  temperatures.  Karoly
and Braganza (2001) also examined the correlation structure of
surface  air  temperature  variations.  They  used  several  simple
indices, including  the  land-ocean  contrast, the  meridional

gradient, and  the  magnitude  of  the  seasonal  cycle, to  describe
global climate variations and showed that for natural variations,
they contain information independent of the global mean temper-
ature. They found that the observed trends in these indices over
the  last  40  years  are  unlikely  to  have  occurred  due  to  natural
climate variations and that they are consistent with model simula-
tions of anthropogenic climate change.

Statistical models of time-series
Further  extensions  involve  the  use  of  statistical  “models” of
global, hemispheric  and  regional  temperature  time-series.  Note
however, that  the  stochastic  models  used  in  these  time-series
studies are generally not built from physical principles and are
thus not as strongly constrained by our knowledge of the physical
climate  system  as  climate  models. All  these  studies  depend  on
inferring  the  statistical  properties  of  the  time-series  from  an
assumed  noise  model  with  parameters  estimated  from  the
residuals. As such, the conclusions depend on the appropriateness
or otherwise of the noise model.

Tol  and  de  Vos  (1998), using  a  Bayesian  approach, fit  a
hierarchy  of  time-series  models  to  global  mean  near-surface
temperature. They find that there is a robust statistical relation-
ship between atmospheric CO2 and global mean temperature and
that  natural  variability  is  unlikely  to  be  an  explanation  for  the
observed temperature change of the past century. Tol and Vellinga
(1998)  further  conclude  that  solar  variation  is  also  an  unlikely
explanation.  Zheng  and  Basher  (1999)  use  similar  time-series
models and show that deterministic trends are detectable over a
large part of the globe. Walter et al. (1998), using neural network
models, estimate that the warming during the past century due to
greenhouse  gas  increases  is  0.9  to  1.3°C  and  that  the  counter-
balancing  cooling  due  to  sulphate  aerosols  is  0.2  to  0.4°C.
Similar  results  are  obtained  with  a  multiple  regression  model
(Schönwiese et al., 1997). Kaufmann and Stern (1997) examine
the lagged-covariance structure of hemispheric mean temperature
and find it consistent with unequal anthropogenic aerosol forcing
in  the  two  hemispheres.  Smith  et  al. (2001), using  similar
bivariate time-series models, find that the evidence for causality
becomes weak when the effects of ENSO are taken into account.
Bivariate  time-series  models  of  hemispheric  mean  temperature
that  account  for  box–diffusion  estimates  of  the  response  to
anthropogenic and solar forcing are found to fit the observations

significantly better than competing statistical models. All of these
studies draw conclusions that are consistent with those of earlier
trend detection studies (as described in the SAR).

In summary, despite various caveats in each individual result,
time-series  studies  suggest  that  natural  signals  and  internal
variability alone are unlikely to explain the instrumental record,
and  that  an  anthropogenic  component  is  required  to  explain
changes in the most recent four or five decades.

12.4.2  Pattern Correlation Methods

12.4.2.1 Horizontal patterns
Results  from  studies  using  pattern  correlations  were  reported
extensively in the SAR (for example, Santer et al., 1995, 1996c;
Mitchell et al., 1995b). They found that the patterns of simulated
surface  temperature  change  due  to  the  main  anthropogenic
factors  in  recent  decades  are  significantly  closer  to  those
observed than expected by chance. Pattern correlations have been
used because they are simple and are insensitive to errors in the
amplitude of the spatial pattern of response and, if centred, to the
global mean response. They are also less sensitive than regres-
sion-based optimal detection techniques to sampling error in the
model-simulated response. The aim of pattern-correlation studies
is to use the differences in the large-scale patterns of response, or
“fingerprints”, to distinguish between different causes of climate
change. 

Strengths and weaknesses of correlation methods
Pattern  correlation  statistics  come  in  two  types  –  centred  and
uncentred (see Appendix 12.3). The centred (uncentred) statistic
measures the similarity of two patterns after (without) removal of
the global mean. Legates and Davis (1997) criticised the use of
centred correlation in detection studies. They argued that correla-
tions could increase while observed and simulated global means
diverge. This was precisely the reason centred correlations were
introduced (e.g., Santer et al., 1993): to provide an indicator that
was  statistically  independent  of  global  mean  temperature
changes. If both global mean changes and centred pattern correla-
tions point towards the same explanation of observed temperature
changes, it  provides  more  compelling  evidence  than  either  of
these indicators in isolation. An explicit analysis of the role of the
global mean in correlation-based studies can be provided by the

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

use of both centred and uncentred statistics. Pattern correlation-
based  detection  studies  account  for  spatial  auto-correlation
implicitly  by  comparing  the  observed  pattern  correlation  with
values that are realised in long control simulations (see Wigley et
al., 2000). These studies do not consider the amplitude of anthro-
pogenic  signals, and  thus  centred  correlations  alone  are  not
sufficient for the attribution of climate change. 

Wigley et al. (1998b) studied the performance of correlation
statistics  in  an  idealised  study  in  which  known  spatial  signal
patterns were combined with realistic levels of internal variability.
The statistics were found to perform well even when the signal is
contaminated with noise. They found, in agreement with Johns et
al. (2001), that  using  an  earlier  base  period  can  enhance
detectability, but  that  much  of  this  advantage  is  lost  when  the
reduced  data  coverage  of  earlier  base  periods  is  taken  into
account.  They  also  found  that  reasonable  combinations  of
greenhouse gas and aerosol patterns are more easily detected than
the greenhouse gas pattern on its own. This last result indicates the
importance of reducing the uncertainty in the estimate of aerosol
forcing, particularly the indirect effects. In summary, we have a
better understanding of the behaviour of pattern correlation statis-
tics and reasons for the discrepancies between different studies. 

12.4.2.2 Vertical patterns 
As  noted  in  Section  12.3.2, increases  in  greenhouse  gases
produce a distinctive change in the vertical profile of temperature.
Santer  et  al. (1996c)  assessed  the  significance  of  the  observed
changes  in  recent  decades  using  equilibrium  GCM  simulations
with changes in greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols and strato-
spheric  ozone. This  study  has  been  extended  to  include  results
from  the  transient  AOGCM  simulations, additional  sensitivity
studies and estimates of internal variability from three different
models (Santer et al., 1996a). Results from this study are consis-
tent with the earlier results – the 25-year trend from 1963 to 1988
in  the  centred  correlation  statistic  between  the  observed  and
simulated  patterns  for  the  full  atmosphere  was  significantly
different  from  the  population  of  25-year  trends  in  the  control
simulations. The results were robust even if the estimates of noise
levels  were  almost  doubled, or  the  aerosol  response  (assumed
linear and additive) was halved. The aerosol forcing leads to a
smaller  warming  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  than  in  the
Southern Hemisphere. 

Tett et al. (1996) refined Santer et al.’s (1996a) study by using
ensembles of transient simulations which included increases in
CO2, and  sulphate  aerosols, and  reductions  in  stratospheric
ozone, as well as using an extended record of observations (see
Figure  12.8).  They  found  that  the  best  and  most  significant
agreement  with  observations  was  found  when  all  three  factors
were  included1.  Allen  and  Tett  (1999)  find  that  the  effect  of
greenhouse gases can be detected with these signal patterns using
optimal detection (see Appendix 12.1).

Folland et al. (1998) and Sexton et al. (2001) take a comple-
mentary approach using an atmospheric model forced with sea

adding sulphate and ozone forcing was no longer significant.

surface  temperatures  (SST)  and  ice  extents  prescribed  from
observations.  The  correlation  between  the  observed  and
simulated temperature changes in the vertical relative to the base
period from 1961 to 1975 was computed. The experiments with
anthropogenic forcing (including some with tropospheric ozone
changes), give significantly higher correlations than when only
SST changes are included. 

Interpretation of results
Weber  (1996)  and  Michaels  and  Knappenburger  (1996)  both
criticised  the  Santer  et  al. (1996a)  results, quoting  upper  air
measurements analysed by Angell (1994). Weber argued that the
increasing pattern similarity over the full atmosphere (850 to 50
hPa)  resulted  mainly  from  a  Southern  Hemisphere  cooling
associated  with  stratospheric  ozone  depletion.  Santer  et  al.
(1996b) pointed out that when known biases in the radiosonde
data  are  removed  (e.g., Parker  et  al., 1997), or  satellite  or
operationally  analysed  data  are  used, the  greater  stratospheric
cooling  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  all  but  disappears.  Weber
(1996)  is  correct  that  stratospheric  cooling  due  to  ozone  will
contribute to the pattern similarity over the full atmosphere, but
decreases  in  stratospheric  ozone  alone  would  be  expected  to
produce a tropospheric cooling, not a warming as observed. This
point should be born in mind when considering a later criticism
of  the  pattern  correlation  approach.  Both  Weber  (1996)  and
Michaels  and  Knappenburger  (1996)  note  that  the  greater
warming  of  the  Southern  Hemisphere  relative  to  the  Northern
Hemisphere from 1963 to 1988 has since reversed. They attribute
the  Southern  Hemisphere  warming  from  1963  to  the  recovery
from the cooling following the eruption of Mount Agung. Santer
et  al. (1996b)  claim  that  this  change  in  asymmetry  is  to  be
expected, because  the  heating  due  to  increases  in  greenhouse
gases  over  the  most  recent  years  has  probably  been  growing
faster than the estimated cooling due to increases in aerosols (see
Section  12.2.3.3).  Calculations  of  the  difference  in  the  rate  of
warming between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres vary
between  different  climate  models  and  as  a  function  of  time,
depending on the relative forcing due to greenhouse gases and
sulphate  aerosols, and  on  the  simulated  rate  of  oceanic  heat
uptake in the Southern Hemisphere (Santer et al., 1996b; Karoly
and Braganza, 2001). 

Assessing statistical significance of changes in the vertical
patterns of temperature
There  are  some  difficulties  in  assessing  the  statistical  signifi-
cance  in  detection  studies  based  on  changes  in  the  vertical
temperature profile. First, the observational record is short, and
subject to error, particularly at upper levels (Chapter 2). Second,
the model estimates of variability may not be realistic (Section
12.2.2), particularly in the stratosphere. Third, because of data
and model limitations, the number of levels used to represent
the stratosphere in detection studies to date is small, and hence
may not be adequate to allow an accurate representation of the
stratospheric response. Fourth, all models produce a maximum
warming in the upper tropical troposphere that is not apparent
in  the  observations  and  whose  impact  on  detection  results  is
difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, all the studies indicate that

Box 12.1: Optimal detection

Optimal detection is a technique that may help to provide a clearer separation of a climate change fingerprint from natural internal
climate variations. The principle is sketched in Figure 12.B1, below (after Hasselmann, 1976).

Suppose for simplicity that most of the natural variability can be described in terms of two modes (well-defined spatial patterns) of
variability. In the absence of climate change, the amplitudes of these two modes, plotted on a 2D diagram along OX and OY will
vary with time, and for a given fraction of occasions (usually chosen as 95 %), the amplitude of each mode will lie within the shaded
ellipse. Suppose we are attempting to detect a fingerprint that can be made up of a linear combination of the two patterns such that
it lies along OB. The signal to noise ratio is given by OB/OBn. Because our signal lies close to the direction of the main component
of variability, the signal to noise ratio is small. On the other hand, we can choose a direction OC that overlaps less with the main
component of natural variability such that the signal to noise ratio OC/OCn for the component of the signal that lies in direction
OC is larger even though the projected signal OC is smaller then the full signal OB. Optimal detection techniques merely choose
the direction OC that maximises the signal to noise ratio. This is equivalent to general linear regression (see Appendix 12.1). A good
estimate of natural internal variability is required to optimise effectively.

anthropogenic  factors  account  for  a  significant  part  of  recent
observed  changes, whereas  internal  and  naturally  forced
variations alone, at least as simulated by current models, cannot
explain  the  observed  changes.  In  addition, there  are  physical
arguments for attributing the changes in the vertical profile of
temperature to anthropogenic influence (Section 12.3.2).

12.4.3.1 Single pattern studies
Since the SAR, optimal detection studies of surface temperature
have been extended (Hegerl et al., 1997, 2000; Barnett et al.,
1999) and new studies of data other than surface air temperature
have been conducted (Allen and Tett, 1999; Paeth and Hense,
2001; Tett et al., 2000).

12.4.3 Optimal Fingerprint Methods

The use of “optimal” techniques can increase the detectability
of  forced  climate  changes.  These  techniques  increase  the
signal-to-noise  ratio  by  looking  at  the  component  of  the
response away from the direction of highest internal variability
(see, e.g., Hasselmann, 1979, 1997, 1993;  North  et  al., 1995;
see  also  Box  12.1  on  optimal  detection  and Appendix  12.1).
Several  new  approaches  to  the  optimal  detection  of  anthro-
pogenic climate change have been undertaken since the SAR.
We focus on optimal detection studies that use a single pattern
of  climate  change  in  the  following  section.  Attribution  (see
Section  12.1.1), which  requires  us  to  consider  several  signals
simultaneously, will  be  considered  in  Sections  12.4.3.2  and
12.4.3.3. 

Surface temperature patterns
The Hegerl et al. (1996) optimal detection study was extended
to  include  more  recent  estimates  of  internal  variability  and
simulations with a representation of sulphate aerosols (Hegerl
et al., 1997). As in the previous study, different control simula-
tions  were  used  to  determine  the  optimal  fingerprint  and  the
significance  level  of  recent  temperature  change.  The  authors
find  significant  evidence  for  a  “greenhouse  gas  plus  sulphate
aerosol” (GS) fingerprint in the most recent observed 30-year
temperature trends regardless of whether internal variability is
estimated  from  models  or  observations.  The  30-year  trend
ending  in  the  1940s  was  found  to  be  significantly  larger  than
expected  from  internal  variability, but  less  so  than  the  more
recent  trends.  This  work  has  been  extended  to  include  other
models (Figure 12.10a; see also Barnett et al., 1999: Hegerl et

722

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

al., 2000), examining  whether  the  amplitude  of  the  50-year
summer  surface  temperature  trends  in  the  GS  simulations  is
consistent with that estimated in the observations. In eleven out
of fourteen cases (seven models each evaluated using the finger-
prints from the two original models), the model trends are consis-
tent with observations. The greenhouse gas only simulations are
generally  not  consistent  with  observations, as  their  warming
trends  are  too  large.  Berliner  et  al. (2000)  detect  a  combined
greenhouse gas and sulphate signal in a fixed pattern detection
study of temperature changes using Bayesian techniques.

Vertical patterns of temperature
Allen and Tett (1999) use optimal detection methods to study
the  change  in  the  vertical  profile  of  zonal  mean  temperature
between  1961  to  1980  and  1986  to  1995.  Estimated  signals
from ensemble AOGCM simulations with greenhouse gas alone
(G), greenhouse  gas  plus  direct  sulphate  (GS), and  also
including stratospheric ozone forcing (GSO; Tett et al., 1996)
are considered. The G and GSO signals are detected separately.
The amplitude of the GSO fingerprint estimated from observa-
tions is found to be consistent with that simulated by the model,
while the model-simulated response to greenhouse gases alone
was  found  to  be  unrealistically  strong.  The  variance  of  the
residuals that remain after the estimated signal is removed from
the observations is consistent with internal variability estimated
from a control run. 

Other climatic variables
Schnur (2001) applied the optimal detection technique to trends
in a variety of climate diagnostics. Changes in the annual mean
surface  temperature  were  found  to  be  highly  significant  (in
agreement with previous results from Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997).
The predicted change in the annual cycle of temperature as well
as  winter  means  of  diurnal  temperature  range  can  also  be
detected  in  most  recent  observations.  The  changes  are  most
consistent  with  those  expected  from  increasing  greenhouse
gases and aerosols. However, changes in the annual mean and
annual cycle of precipitation were small and not significant. 

Paeth  and  Hense  (2001)  applied  a  correlation  method
related to the optimal fingerprint method to 20-year trends of
lower tropospheric mean temperature (between 500 and 1,000
hPa)  in  the  summer  half  of  the  year  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere north of 55°N. Greenhouse gas fingerprints from
two models were detected. The combined greenhouse gas plus
(direct) sulphate (GS) fingerprints from the two models were
not detected. 

Summary
All new single-pattern studies published since the SAR detect
anthropogenic fingerprints in the global temperature observa-
tions, both  at  the  surface  and  aloft.  The  signal  amplitudes
estimated  from  observations  and  modelled  amplitudes  are
consistent at the surface if greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol
forcing  are  taken  into  account, and  in  the  free  atmosphere  if
ozone forcing is also included. Fingerprints based on smaller
areas  or  on  other  variables  yield  more  ambiguous  results  at
present.

12.4.3.2 Optimal detection studies that use multiple fixed signal 

patterns

Surface temperature patterns
Hegerl et al. (1997) applied a two-fingerprint approach, using a
greenhouse  gas  fingerprint  and  an  additional  sulphate  aerosol
fingerprint that is made spatially independent (orthogonalised) of
the  greenhouse  fingerprint.  They  analysed  50-year  trends  in
observed  northern  summer  temperatures.  The  influence  of
greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol signals were both detected
simultaneously  in  the  observed  pattern  of  50-year  temperature
trends, and  the  amplitudes  of  both  signals  were  found  to  be
consistent between model and observations. Simulations forced
with greenhouse gases alone and solar irradiance changes alone
were not consistent with observations. 

Hegerl  et  al. (2000)  repeated  this  analysis  using  parallel
simulations from a different climate model. The combined effect
of greenhouse gases and aerosols was still detectable and consis-
tent  with  observations, but  the  separate  influence  of  sulphate
aerosol  forcing, as  simulated  by  this  second  model, was  not
detectable. This was because the sulphate response was weaker in
the second model, and closely resembled one of the main modes
of  natural  variability.  Hence, the  detection  of  the  net  anthro-
pogenic signal is robust, but the detection of the sulphate aerosol
component  is  very  sensitive  to  differences  in  model-simulated
responses. 

As in the single-pattern case, this study has been extended to
include  seven  model  GS  simulations  and  to  take  into  account
observational sampling error (Figure 12.10b,c, see also Barnett et
al., 1999;  Hegerl  et  al. 2001).  A  simple  linear  transformation
allows  results  to  be  displayed  in  terms  of  individual  greenhouse
and  sulphate  signal  amplitudes, which  assists  comparison  with
other  results  (see  Figure  12.10;  Hegerl  and  Allen, 2000).  The
amplitudes  of  the  greenhouse  gas  and  sulphate  components  are
simultaneously consistent with the observed amplitudes in 10 of
the fourteen GS cases (seven models for two sets of fingerprints)
displayed.  This  contrasts  with  eleven  out  of  fourteen  in  the
combined amplitude test described in Section 12.4.3.1. If the trends
to 1995 are used (Figure 12.10c), the results are similar, though in
this  case, the  ellipse  just  includes  the  origin  and  six  out  of  the
fourteen GS cases are consistent with observations. The inconsis-
tency  can  be  seen  to  be  mainly  due  to  large  variations  in  the
amplitudes of the model-simulated responses to sulphate aerosols
(indicated  by  the  vertical  spread  of  results).  Model-simulated
responses to greenhouse gases are generally more consistent both
with  each  other  and  with  observations.  Two  of  the  cases  of
disagreement  are  based  on  a  single  simulation  rather  than  an
ensemble mean and should therefore be viewed with caution (see
Barnett et al., 2000). Barnett et al. (1999) found that the degree of
agreement between the five models and observations they consid-
ered  was  similar, whether  or  not  the  global  mean  response  was
removed  from  the  patterns.  Signal  amplitudes  from  simulations
with greenhouse gas forcing only are generally inconsistent with
those estimated from observations (Figure 12.10b,c).

In most of the cases presented here, the response to natural
forcings  was  neglected.  In  a  similar  analysis  to  that  just
described, Hegerl et al. (2000); see also Barnett et al., 1999) also
assessed  simulations  of  the  response  to  volcanic  and  solar

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

723

forcing. They find, in agreement with Tett et al. (1999), that there
is better agreement between observations and simulations when
these natural forcings are included, particularly in the early 20th
century, but  that  natural  forcings  alone  cannot  account  for  the
late-century warming. 

In summary, the estimation of the contribution of individual
factors  to  recent  climate  change  is  highly  model  dependent,
primarily due to uncertainties in the forcing and response due to
sulphate  aerosols.  However, although  the  estimated  amplitude
varies  from  study  to  study, all  studies  indicate  a  substantial
contribution from anthropogenic greenhouse gases to the changes
observed over the latter half of the 20th century.

Vertical patterns of temperature
Allen and Tett (1999) also used spatial fingerprints in the vertical
derived from simulations with greenhouse gas forcing alone and
simulations  with  greenhouse  gas, sulphate  aerosol  and  strato-
spheric  ozone  forcing.  These  authors  show  that, even  if  both
greenhouse  and  other  anthropogenic  signals  are  estimated
simultaneously in the observed record, a significant response to
greenhouse gases remains detectable. Hill et al. (2001) extended
this analysis to include model-simulated responses to both solar
and  volcanic  forcing, and  again  found  that  the  response  to
greenhouse gases remains detectable. Results with non-optimised
fingerprints  are  consistent  with  the  optimised  case, but  the
uncertainty range is larger. 

In summary, the fixed pattern studies indicate that the recent
warming  is  unlikely  (bordering  on  very  unlikely)  to  be  due  to
internal  climate  variability.  A  substantial  response  to  anthro-
pogenic greenhouse gases appears to be necessary to account for
recent temperature trends but the majority of studies indicate that
greenhouse gases alone do not appear to be able to provide a full
explanation.  Inclusion  of  the  response  to  the  direct  effect  of
sulphate aerosols usually leads to a more satisfactory explanation
of the observed changes, although the amplitude of the sulphate
signal  depends  on  the  model  used.  These  studies  also  provide
some evidence that solar variations may have contributed to the
early century warming. 

12.4.3.3 Space-time studies
Here we consider studies that incorporate the time evolution of
forced  signals  into  the  optimal  detection  formalism.  These
studies use evolving patterns of historical climate change in the
20th century that are obtained from climate models forced with
historical anthropogenic and natural forcing. Explicit representa-
tion of the time dimension of the signals yields a more powerful
approach for both detecting and attributing climate change (see
Hasselmann, 1993;  North  et  al., 1995)  since  it  helps  to  distin-
guish between responses to external forcings with similar spatial
patterns  (e.g., solar  and  greenhouse  gas  forcing).  The  time
variations of the signals can be represented either directly in the
time domain or transformed to the frequency domain. 

Surface temperature
Tett et al. (1999) and Stott et al. (2001) describe a detection and
attribution study that uses the space-time approach (see Appendix
12.2).  They  estimate  the  magnitude  of  modelled  20th  century

greenhouse  gas, aerosol, solar  and  volcanic  signals  in  decadal
mean  data.  Signals  are  fitted  by  general  linear  regression  to
moving  fifty-year  intervals  beginning  with  1906  to  1956  and
ending  1946  to  1996.  The  signals  are  obtained  from  four
ensembles of transient change simulations, each using a different
historical forcing scenario. Greenhouse gas, greenhouse gas plus
direct sulphate aerosol, low frequency solar, and volcanic forcing
scenarios were used. Each ensemble contains four independent
simulations  with  the  same  transient  forcing.  Two  estimates  of
natural variability, one used for optimisation and the other for the
estimation  of  confidence  intervals, are  obtained  from  separate
segments of a long control simulation. 

Signal amplitudes estimated with multiple regression become
uncertain when the signals are strongly correlated (“degenerate”).
Despite  the  problem  of  degeneracy, positive  and  significant
greenhouse  gas  and  sulphate  aerosol  signals  are  consistently
detected  in  the  most  recent  fifty-year  period  (Figure  12.11)
regardless of which or how many other signals are included in the
analysis  (Allen  et  al., 2000a;  Stott  et  al., 2001).  The  residual
variation that remains after removal of the signals is consistent
with the model’s internal variability. In contrast, recent decadal
temperature changes are not consistent with the model’s internal
climate  variability  alone, nor  with  any  combination  of  internal
variability  and  naturally  forced  signals, even  allowing  for  the
possibility  of  unknown  processes  amplifying  the  response  to
natural forcing.

Tett et al. (2000) have completed a study using a model with
no  flux  adjustments, an  interactive  sulphur  cycle, an  explicit
representation  of  individual  greenhouse  gases  and  an  explicit
treatment  of  scattering  by  aerosols.  Two  ensembles  of  four
simulations for the instrumental period were run, one with natural
(solar  and  volcanic)  forcing  only  and  the  other  anthropogenic
(well-mixed  greenhouse  gases, ozone  and  direct  and  indirect
sulphate  aerosol)  forcing  only  (see  Figure  12.4).  They  find  a
substantial  response  to  anthropogenic  forcing  is  needed  to
explain  observed  changes  in  recent  decades, and  that  natural
forcing may have contributed significantly to early 20th century
climate change. The best agreement between model simulations
and observations over the last 140 years has been found when all
the above anthropogenic and natural forcing factors are included
(Stott  et  al., 2000b;  Figure  12.7c). These  results  show  that  the
forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed changes,
but  do  not  exclude  the  possibility  that  other  forcings  may  also
have contributed.

The detection of a response to solar forcing in the early part
of the century (1906 to 1956) is less robust and depends on the
details of the analysis. If seasonally stratified data are used (Stott
et  al., 2001), the  detection  of  a  significant  solar  influence  on
climate in the first half of the century becomes clearer with the
solar irradiance reconstruction of Hoyt and Schatten (1993), but
weaker with that from Lean et al. (1995). Volcanism appears to
show only a small signal in recent decadal temperature trends and
could only be detected using either annual mean data or specifi-
cally chosen decades (Stott et al., 2001). The residual variability
that remains after the naturally forced signals are removed from
the observations of the most recent five decades are not consis-
tent  with  model  internal  variability, suggesting  that  natural

prints was used. The observed signal amplitude is consistent with contemporaneous GS amplitudes for most models’ GS simulations. 90%
confidence intervals are shown by solid lines for estimates using ECHAM3/LSG fingerprints and by dashed lines for estimates based on HadCM2
fingerprints. Cases where a model’s and the observed amplitude disagree are marked by a cross on the axis. (b) and (c) show an estimate of the
observed amplitude of a greenhouse gas signal (horizontal axis) and a sulphate aerosol signal (vertical axis) estimated simultaneously. Both signal
amplitudes can be estimated as positive from observations based on ECHAM3/LSG fingerprints shown in (b) while only the greenhouse gas signal
is detected based on HadCM2 fingerprints shown in panel (c). The amplitudes of both signals from the observations are compared with those from
model simulations forced with various forcing histories and using different climate models (1: HadCM2; 2: ECHAM3/LSG; 3: GFDL; 4:
ECHAM4/OPYC; 5: CCCma1; 6: CCCma2). Simulations with symbols shown in black are consistent with observations relative to the uncertainty
in observations (grey ellipse) and that of the model simulations (not shown). Simulations which are inconsistent are shown in grey. Model simula-
tions where only a single ensemble member is available are illustrated by thin symbols, those based on ensembles of simulations by fat symbols.

Results from consistency tests indicate that most greenhouse gas only simulations (G, shown by “×”) are inconsistent with observations. Ten of
the GS simulations in both panels are in agreement with observed trend patterns, discrepancies arise mostly from the magnitude of a sulphate signal
(vertical axis). The failure to detect a sulphate signal as well as a greenhouse gas signal in panel (c) is due to the two signals being very highly
correlated if only spatial patterns are used- this makes separation of the signals difficult. These results show that estimates of a sulphate aerosol
signal from observations are model dependent and quite uncertain, while a single anthropogenic signal can be estimated with more confidence.

All units are in °C/50 year, values in the upper right quadrant refer to a physically meaningful greenhouse warming and sulphate aerosol cooling
signal. The consistency test establishes whether the difference between a model’s and the observed amplitude estimate is significantly larger than the
combined uncertainty in the observations (internal variability + observational uncertainty) and the model simulation (internal variability). The figure
is derived by updating the data used by Barnett et al. (1999) (for details of the analysis see Hegerl et al., 2000) and then applying a simple linear
transformation of the multi-regression results (Hegerl and Allen, 2000).

Results for 1946 to 1995 period used by Barnett et al. (1999) are similar, except fewer of the models in b and c agree with observations and the

case of both signals being zero in c is not rejected. Simulations of natural forcing only ending before 1998 are also rejected in that case.

forcing alone cannot explain the observed 20th century tempera-
ture variations. Note that Delworth and Knutson (2000) find one
out of five of their simulations with only anthropogenic forcing
can reproduce the early century global mean warming, including
the  enhanced  warming  in  Northern  Hemisphere  high  latitudes.
Hence  a  substantial  response  to  anthropogenic  (specifically
greenhouse)  forcing  appears  necessary  to  account  for  the
warming over the past 50 years, but it remains unclear whether
natural external forcings are necessary to explain the early 20th
century warming.

Sensitivity of results
A variety of sensitivity tests confirm that the detection of anthro-
pogenic signals is insensitive to differences between solar forcing
reconstructions, the  inclusion  of  additional  forcing  through  the
specification of observed stratospheric ozone concentrations, and
to varying details of the analysis (including omitting the signal-
to-noise  optimisation).  Tett  et  al. (1999, 2000)  also  found  that
detection of an anthropogenic signal continues to hold even when
the standard deviation of the control simulation is inflated by a
factor  of  two.  Uncertainty  in  the  signals  is  unavoidable  when
ensembles are small, as is the case in Tett et al. (1999), and biases
the estimates of the signal amplitudes towards zero. Consistent
results are obtained when this source of uncertainty is taken into
account  (Allen  and  Stott, 2000;  Stott  et  al., 2000a).  However
amplitude  estimates  become  more  uncertain, particularly  if  the
underlying  signal  is  small  compared  with  internal  climate
variability.  Accounting  for  sampling  uncertainty  in  model-
simulated  signals  indicates  a  greater  degree  of  greenhouse
warming and compensating aerosol cooling in the latter part of
the century than shown by Tett et al. (1999). Gillett et al. (2000b)
find  that  discounting  the  temperature  changes  associated  with
changes in the Arctic Oscillation (Thompson and Wallace, 1998;
Thompson et al., 2000), which are not simulated by the model,
does not significantly alter the Tett et al. (1999) results.

Confidence intervals and scaling factors
Confidence intervals for the signal amplitudes that are obtained
from the regression of modelled signals onto observations can be
re-expressed as ranges of scaling factors that are required to make
modelled signal amplitudes consistent with those estimated from
observations (see, e.g., Allen and Tett, 1999). The results show
that  the  range  of  scaling  factors  includes  unity  (i.e., model  is
consistent with observations) for both the greenhouse gas and the
sulphate aerosol signal, and that the scaling factors vary only to a
reasonable (and consistent) extent between 50-year intervals. 

The scaling factors can also be used to estimate the contribu-
tion  from  anthropogenic  factors  other  than  well-mixed
greenhouse  gases.  Using  the  methodology  of  Allen  and  Stott
(2000) on the simulations described by Tett et al. (2000), the 5 to
95%  uncertainty  range  for  scaling  the  combined  response
changes  in  tropospheric  ozone  and  direct  and  indirect  sulphate
forcing  over  the  last  fifty  years  is  0.6  to  1.6.  The  simulated
indirect effect of aerosol forcing is by far the biggest contributor
to this signal. Ignoring the possible effects of neglected forcings
and assuming that the forcing can be scaled in the same way as
the  response, this  translates  to  a −0.5  to −1.5 Wm−2 change  in

forcing due to the indirect effect since pre-industrial times. This
range  lies  well  within  that  given  in  Chapter  6  but  the  limits
obtained are sensitive to the model used. Note that large values of
the  indirect  response  are  consistently  associated  with  a  greater
sensitivity to greenhouse gases. This would increase this model’s
estimate of future warming: a large indirect effect coupled with
decreases  in  sulphate  emissions  would  further  enhance  future
warming (Allen et al., 2000b). 

Allen  et  al. (2000a)  have  determined  scaling  factors  from
other  model  simulations  (Figure  12.12)  and  found  that  the
modelled  response  to  the  combination  of  greenhouse  gas  and
sulphate  aerosol  forcing  is  consistent  with  that  observed.  The
scaling  factors  ranging  from  0.8  to  1.2  and  the  corresponding
95%  confidence  intervals  cover  the  range  0.5  to  1.6.  Scaling
factors  for  50-year  JJA  trends  are  also  easily  derived  from  the
results published in Hegerl et al. (2000). The resulting range of
factors is consistent with that of Allen et al. (2000a), but wider
because the diagnostic used in Allen et al. (2000b) enhances the
signal-to-noise  ratio.  If  it  is  assumed  that  the  combination  of
greenhouse  warming  and  sulphate  cooling  simulated  by  these
AOGCMs  is  the  only  significant  external  contributor  to  inter-
decadal near-surface temperature changes over the latter half of
the  20th  century, then  Allen  et  al. (2000a)  estimate  that  the
anthropogenic  warming  over  the  last  50  years  is  0.05  to
0.11°C/decade.  Making  a  similar  assumption, Hegerl  et  al.
(2000) estimate 0.02 to 0.12°C/decade with a best guess of 0.06
to  0.08°C/decade  (model  dependent, Figure  12.10).  The
smallness of the range of uncertainty compared with the observed
change indicates that natural internal variability alone is unlikely
(bordering  on  very  unlikely)  to  account  for  the  observed
warming.

Given  the  uncertainties  in  sulphate  aerosol  and  natural
forcings and responses, these single-pattern confidence intervals
give an incomplete picture. We cannot assume that the response
to  sulphate  forcing  (relative  to  the  greenhouse  signal)  is  as
simulated in these greenhouse-plus-sulphate simulations; nor can
we assume the net response to natural forcing is negligible even
though observations of surface temperature changes over the past
30 to 50 years are generally consistent with both these assump-
tions. Hence we need also to consider uncertainty ranges based
on estimating several signals simultaneously (Figure 12.12, right
hand  panels).  These  are  generally  larger  than  the  single-signal
estimates because we are attempting to estimate more informa-
tion from the same amount of data (Tett et al., 1999; Allen and
Stott, 2000; Allen et al., 2000a). Nevertheless, the conclusion of
a  substantial  greenhouse  contribution  to  the  recent  observed
warming trend is unchanged. 

Estimation of uncertainty in predictions
The scaling factors derived from optimal detection can also be
used to constrain predictions of future climate change resulting
from  anthropogenic  emissions  (Allen  et  al., 2000b).  The  best
guess scaling and uncertainty limits for each component can be
applied to the model predictions, providing objective uncertainty
limits  that  are  based  on  observations.  These  estimates  are
independent of possible errors in the individual model’s climate
sensitivity and time-scale of oceanic adjustment, provided these

errors are persistent over time. An example based on the IS92a
(IPCC, 1992) GS scenario (whose exact forcing varies between
models, see Chapter 9, Table 9.1 for details) is shown in Figure
12.13 based on a limited number of model simulations. Note that
in each case, the original warming predicted by the model lies in
the range consistent with the observations. A rate of warming of
0.1 to 0.2°C/decade is likely over the first few decades of the 21st
century under this scenario. Allen et al. (2000b) quote a 5 to 95%
(“very likely”) uncertainty range of 0.11 to 0.24°C/decade for the
decades 1996 to 2046 under the IS92a scenario, but, given the
uncertainties  and  assumptions  behind  their  analysis, the  more
cautious  “likely” qualifier  is  used  here.  For  comparison, the
simple  model  tuned  to  the  results  of  seven AOGCMs  used  for
projections in Chapter 9 gives a range of 0.12 to 0.22°C/decade
under  the  IS92a  scenario, although  it  should  be  noted  that  this
similarity  may  reflect  some  cancellation  of  errors  and  equally
good  agreement  between  the  two  approaches  should  not  be
expected for all scenarios, nor for time-scales longer than the few

decades  for  which  the  Allen  et  al.  (2000b)  approach  is  valid.
Figure  12.13  also  shows  that  a  similar  range  of  uncertainty  is
obtained  if  the  greenhouse  gas  and  sulphate  components  are
estimated  separately, in  which  case  the  estimate  of  future
warming  for  this  particular  scenario  is  independent  of  possible
errors in the amplitude of the sulphate forcing and response. Most
of  the  recent  emission  scenarios  indicate  that  future  sulphate
emissions  will  decrease  rather  than  increase  in  the  near  future.
This would lead to a larger global warming since the greenhouse
gas component would no longer be reduced by sulphate forcing at
the same rate as in the past. The level of uncertainty also increases
(see Allen et al., 2000b). The final error bar in Figure 12.13 shows
that  including  the  model-simulated  response  to  natural  forcing
over  the  20th  century  into  the  analysis  has  little  impact  on  the
estimated anthropogenic warming in the 21st century.

It  must  be  stressed  that  the  approach  illustrated  in  Figure
12.13 only addresses the issue of uncertainty in the large-scale
climate response to a particular scenario of future greenhouse gas

Figure 12.12: (a) Estimates of the “scaling factors” by which we have to multiply the amplitude of several model-simulated signals to reproduce
the corresponding changes in the observed record. The vertical bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal variability. A range
encompassing unity implies that this combination of forcing amplitude and model-simulated response is consistent with the corresponding
observed change, while a range encompassing zero implies that this model-simulated signal is not detectable (Allen and Stott, 2000; Stott et al.,
2000a). Signals are defined as the ensemble mean response to external forcing expressed in large-scale (>5000 km) near-surface temperatures over
the 1946 to 1996 period relative to the 1896 to 1996 mean. The first entry (G) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence interval obtained
if we assume the observations consist only of a response to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. The range is significantly less than one
(consistent with results from other models), meaning that models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly overpredict the observed
warming signal. The next eight entries show scaling factors for model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing (GS), with two
cases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, one of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion (GSI and GSIO respec-
tively). All but one (CGCM1) of these ranges is consistent with unity. Hence there is little evidence that models are systematically over- or under-
predicting the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption that model-simulated GS signals and internal variability are an adequate
representation (i.e. that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). Observed residual variability is consistent with this assumption
in all but one case (ECHAM3, indicated by the asterisk). We are obliged to make this assumption to include models for which only a simulation
of the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single-signal cases are incomplete since they do not account for
uncertainty in the naturally forced response. These ranges indicate, however, the high level of confidence with which we can reject internal
variability as simulated by these various models as an explanation of recent near-surface temperature change. 

A more complete uncertainty analysis is provided by the next three entries, which show corresponding scaling factors on individual

greenhouse (G), sulphate (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only (V) signals for those cases in which the relevant simula-
tions have been performed.  In these cases, we estimate multiple factors simultaneously to account for uncertainty in the amplitude of the naturally
forced response. The uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. In one case (ECHAM3) the model appears
to be overestimating the greenhouse response (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with unity), but this result is sensitive to which
component of the control is used to define the detection space.  It is also not known how it would respond to the inclusion of a volcanic signal. In
cases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 and HadCM3), G and S signals remain detectable and consistent with unity
independent of whether natural signals are estimated jointly or separately (allowing for different errors in S and V responses). (b) Estimated
contributions to global mean warming over the 20th century, based on the results shown in (a), with 5 to 95% confidence intervals. Although the
estimates vary depending on which model’s signal and what forcing is assumed, and are less certain if more than one signal is estimated, all show
a significant contribution from anthropogenic climate change to 20th century warming (from Allen et al., 2000a).

concentrations. This is only one of many interlinked uncertainties
in  the  climate  projection  problem, as  illustrated  in  Chapter  13,
Figure  13.2.  Research  efforts  to  attach  probabilities  to  climate
projections  and  scenarios  are  explored  in  Chapter  13, Section
13.5.2.3.

Forest  et  al. (2000)  used  simulations  with  an  intermediate
complexity  climate  model  in  a  related  approach.  They  used
optimal  detection  results  following  the  procedure  of Allen  and
Tett  (1999)  to  rule  out  combinations  of  model  parameters  that
yield simulations that are not consistent with observations. They
find that low values of the climate sensitivity (<1°C) are consis-
tently ruled out, but the upper bound on climate sensitivity and
the rate of ocean heat uptake remain very uncertain. 

Other space-time approaches
North and Stevens (1998) use a space-frequency method that is
closely  related  to  the  space-time  approach  used  in  the  studies
discussed  above  (see  Appendix  12.2).  They  analyse  100-year

surface  temperature  time-series  of  grid  box  mean  surface
temperatures  in  a  global  network  of  thirty  six  large  (10°×10°)
grid  boxes  for  greenhouse  gas, sulphate  aerosol, volcanic  and
solar cycle signals in the frequency band with periods between
about  8  and  17  years.  The  signal  patterns  were  derived  from
simulations  with  an  EBM  (see  Section  12.2.3).  The  authors
found highly significant responses to greenhouse gas, sulphate
aerosol, and  volcanic  forcing  in  the  observations.  Some
uncertainty  in  their  conclusions  arises  from  model  uncertainty
(see discussion in Section 12.2.3) and from the use of control
simulations  from  older  AOGCMs, which  had  relatively  low
variability, for the estimation of internal climate variability. 

A  number  of  papers  extend  and  analyse  the  North  and
Stevens  (1998)  approach.  Kim  and  Wu  (2000)  extend  the
methodology  to  data  with  higher  (monthly)  time  resolution
and  demonstrate  that  this  may  improve  the  detectability  of
climate  change  signals.  Leroy  (1998)  casts  the  results  from
North and Stevens (1998) in a Bayesian framework. North and

original model simulations (squares) and after scaling to fit the
observed signal as in Figure 12.12(a) (diamonds), with 5 to 95%
confidence intervals. While the original projections vary (depending,
for example, on each model’s climate sensitivity), the scale should be
independent of errors in both sensitivity and rate of oceanic heat
uptake, provided these errors are persistent over time. GS indicates
combined greenhouse and sulphate forcing. G shows the impact of
setting the sulphate forcing to zero but correcting the response to be
consistent with observed 20th century climate change. G&S indicates
greenhouse and sulphate responses estimated separately (in which
case the result is also approximately independent, under this forcing
scenario, to persistent errors in the sulphate forcing and response)
and G&S&N indicates greenhouse, sulphate and natural responses
estimated separately (showing the small impact of natural forcing on
the diagnostic used for this analysis). (From Allen et al., 2000b.)

Wu (2001) modified the method to perform space-time (rather
than space-frequency) detection in the 100-year record. Their
results are broadly similar to those of Tett et al., (1999), Stott
et  al. (2001)  and  North  and  Stevens  (1998).  However, their
best guess includes a small sulphate aerosol signal countered
by  a  relatively  small, but  highly  significant, greenhouse  gas
signal.

All  of  the  space-time  and  space-frequency  optimal
detection  studies  to  date  indicate  a  discernible  human
influence  on  global  climate  and  yield  better-constrained
estimates  of  the  magnitude  of  anthropogenic  signals  than
approaches using spatial information alone. In particular, the
inclusion of temporal information can reduce the degeneracy
that may occur when more than one climate signal is included.
Thus, results  from  time-space  methods  generally  detect
anthropogenic  signals  even  if  natural  forcings  are  estimated
simultaneously  and  show  that  the  combination  of  natural
signals  and  internal  variability  is  inconsistent  with  the
observed surface temperature record.

estimate  of  the  magnitude  of  this  influence.  The  use  of  a
number of forced climate signals, and the extensive treatment
of  various  (but  not  all)  sources  of  uncertainty  increases  our
confidence that a considerable part of the recent warming can
be  attributed  to  anthropogenic  influences.  The  estimated
signals and scaling factors remain subject to the considerable
uncertainty in our knowledge of historic climate forcing from
sources  other  than  greenhouse  gases. While  estimates  of  the
amplitude of a single anthropogenic signal are quite consistent
between  different  model  signals  (see  Figures  12.10, 12.12)
and different approaches, joint estimates of the amplitude of
several  signals  vary  between  models  and  approaches.  Thus
quantitative separation of the observed warming into anthro-
pogenic  and  naturally  forced  components  requires  consider-
able  caution.  Nonetheless, all  recent  studies  reject  natural
forcing and internal variability alone as a possible explanation
of recent climate change. Analyses based on a single anthro-
pogenic  signal  focusing  on  continental  and  global  scales
indicate that:

• Changes over the past 30 to 50 years are very unlikely to be

due to internal variability as simulated by current models.

• The combined response to greenhouse and sulphate forcing
is  more  consistent  with  the  observed  record  than  the
response to greenhouse gases alone.

• Inclusion  of  the  simulated  response  to  stratospheric  ozone
depletion improves the simulation of the vertical structure of
the response.

Analyses based on multiple anthropogenic and natural signals
indicate that:

• The  combination  of  natural  external  forcing  (solar  and
volcanic) and internal variability is unlikely to account for
the spatio-temporal pattern of change over the past 30 to 50
years, even  allowing  for  possible  amplification  of  the
amplitude  of  natural  responses  by  unknown  feedback
processes.

• Anthropogenic greenhouse gases are likely to have made a
significant  and  substantial  contribution  to  the  warming
observed over the second half of the 20th century, possibly
larger than the total observed warming.

• The  contribution  from  anthropogenic  sulphate  aerosols  is
less  clear, but  appears  to  lie  in  a  range  broadly  consistent
with  the  spread  of  current  model  simulations.  A  high
sulphate  aerosol  forcing  is  consistently  associated  with  a
stronger response to greenhouse forcing.

uncertainties in the magnitude and patterns of natural variability,
and in the radiative forcing and climate response resulting from
human activity.

The SAR predicted an increase in the anthropogenic contri-
bution to global mean temperature of slightly over 0.1°C in the
five  years  following  the  SAR, which  is  consistent  with  the
observed  change  since  the  SAR  (Chapter  2).  The  predicted
increase in the anthropogenic signal (and the observed change)
are small compared to natural variability, so it is not possible to
distinguish  an  anthropogenic  signal  from  natural  variability  on
five year time-scales.

Differences in surface and free atmosphere temperature trends
There  are  unresolved  differences  between  the  observed  and
modelled  temperature  variations  in  the  free  atmosphere.  These
include apparent changes in the temperature difference between
the  surface  and  the  lower  atmosphere, and  differences  in  the
tropical  upper  troposphere.  While  model  simulations  of  large-
scale changes in free atmospheric and surface temperatures are
generally  consistent  with  the  observed  changes, simulated  and
observed trends in troposphere minus surface temperature differ-
ences  are  not  consistent.  It  is  not  clear  whether  this  is  due  to
model or observational error, or neglected forcings in the models.

Internal climate variability
The  precise  magnitude  of  natural  internal  climate  variability
remains  uncertain.  The  amplitude  of  internal  variability  in  the
models  most  often  used  in  detection  studies  differs  by  up  to  a
factor  of  two  from  that  seen  in  the  instrumental  temperature
record  on  annual  to  decadal  time-scales, with  some  models
showing similar or larger variability than observed (Section 12.2;
Chapter 8). However, the instrumental record is only marginally
useful for validating model estimates of variability on the multi-
decadal time-scales that are relevant for detection. Some palaeo-
climatic  reconstructions  of  temperature  suggest  that  multi-
decadal variability in the pre-industrial era was higher than that
generated  internally  by  models  (Section  12.2;  Chapter  8).
However, apart  from  the  difficulties  inherent  in  reconstructing
temperature  accurately  from  proxy  data, the  palaeoclimatic
record  also  includes  the  climatic  response  to  natural  forcings
arising, for example, from variations in solar output and volcanic
activity.  Including  the  estimated  forcing  due  to  natural  factors
increases the longer-term variability simulated by models, while
eliminating  the  response  to  external  forcing  from  the  palaeo-
record brings palaeo-variability estimates closer to model-based
estimates (Crowley, 2000). 

Natural forcing
Estimates of natural forcing have now been included in simula-
tions  over  the  period  of  the  instrumental  temperature  record.

Natural climate variability (forced and/or internally generated) on
its own is generally insufficient to explain the observed changes
in temperature over the last few decades. However, for all but the
most recent two decades, the accuracy of the estimates of forcing
may  be  limited, being  based  entirely  on  proxy  data  for  solar
irradiance and on limited surface data for volcanoes. There are
some indications that solar irradiance fluctuations have indirect
effects in addition to direct radiative heating, for example due to
the substantially stronger variation in the UV band and its effect
on ozone, or hypothesised changes in cloud cover (see Chapter
6).  These  mechanisms  remain  particularly  uncertain  and
currently  are  not  incorporated  in  most  efforts  to  simulate  the
climate  effect  of  solar  irradiance  variations, as  no  quantitative
estimates of their magnitude are currently available.

Anthropogenic forcing
The representation of greenhouse gases and the effect of sulphate
aerosols  has  been  improved  in  models.  However, some  of  the
smaller  forcings, including  those  due  to  biomass  burning  and
changes in land use, have not been taken into account in formal
detection studies. The major uncertainty in anthropogenic forcing
arises  from  the  indirect  effects  of  aerosols.  The  global  mean
forcing is highly uncertain (Chapter 6, Figure 6.8). The estimated
forcing patterns vary from a predominantly Northern Hemisphere
forcing  similar  to  that  due  to  direct  aerosol  effects  (Tett  et  al.,
2000)  to  a  more  globally  uniform  distribution, similar  but
opposite  in  sign  to  that  associated  with  changes  in  greenhouse
gases (Roeckner et al., 1999). If the response to indirect forcing
has a component which can be represented as a linear combina-
tion of the response to greenhouse gases and to the direct forcing
by aerosols, it will influence amplitudes of the responses to these
two factors estimated through optimal detection. 

Estimates of response patterns
Finally, there remains considerable uncertainty in the amplitude
and pattern of the climate response to changes in radiative forcing.
The  large  uncertainty  in  climate  sensitivity, 1.5  to  4.5°C  for  a
doubling  of  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide, has  not  been  reduced
since the SAR, nor is it likely to be reduced in the near future by
the evidence provided by the surface temperature signal alone. In
contrast, the  emerging  signal  provides  a  relatively  strong
constraint  on  forecast  transient  climate  change  under  some
emission scenarios. Some techniques can allow for errors in the
magnitude  of  the  simulated  global  mean  response  in  attribution
studies. As noted in Section 12.2, there is greater pattern similarity
between  simulations  of  greenhouse  gases  alone, and  of
greenhouse  gases  and  aerosols  using  the  same  model, than
between  simulations  of  the  response  to  the  same  change  in
greenhouse  gases  using  different  models.  This  leads  to  some
inconsistency in the estimation of the separate greenhouse gas and
aerosol components using different models (see Section 12.4.3).
In  summary, some  progress  has  been  made  in  reducing
uncertainty, particularly  with  respect  to  distinguishing  the
responses  to  different  external  influences  using  multi-pattern
techniques and in quantifying the magnitude of the modelled and
observed  responses.  Nevertheless, many  of  the  sources  of
uncertainty identified in the SAR still remain.

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

12.6 Concluding Remarks

In the previous sections, we have evaluated the different lines of
evidence  on  the  causes  of  recent  climate  change.  Here, we
summarise  briefly  the  arguments  that  lead  to  our  final  assess-
ment. The reader is referred to the earlier sections for more detail.

20th century climate was unusual.
Palaeoclimatic  reconstructions  for  the  last  1,000  years  (e.g.,
Chapter 2, Figure 2.21) indicate that the 20th century warming is
highly unusual, even taking into account the large uncertainties in
these reconstructions. 

The  observed  warming  is  inconsistent  with  model  estimates  of
natural internal climate variability. 
While these estimates vary substantially, on the annual to decadal
time-scale  they  are  similar, and  in  some  cases  larger, than
obtained from observations. Estimates from models and observa-
tions are uncertain on the multi-decadal and longer time-scales
required for detection. Nonetheless, conclusions on the detection
of an anthropogenic signal are insensitive to the model used to
estimate internal variability. Recent observed changes cannot be
accounted for as pure internal variability even if the amplitude of
simulated  internal  variations  is  increased  by  a  factor  of  two  or
more.  It  is  therefore  unlikely  (bordering  on  very  unlikely)  that
natural  internal  variability  alone  can  explain  the  changes  in
global climate over the 20th century (e.g., Figure 12.1).

The  observed  warming  in  the  latter  half  of  the  20th  century
appears  to  be  inconsistent  with  natural  external  (solar  and
volcanic) forcing of the climate system.
Although there are measurements of these forcings over the last
two decades, estimates prior to that are uncertain, as the volcanic
forcing is based on limited measurements, and the solar forcing
is  based  entirely  on  proxy  data.  However, the  overall  trend  in
natural forcing over the last two, and perhaps four, decades of the
20th  century  is  likely  to  have  been  small  or  negative  (Chapter
6,Table 6.13) and so is unlikely to explain the increased rate of
global warming since the middle of the 20th century.

The observed change in patterns of atmospheric temperature in
the vertical is inconsistent with natural forcing.
The  increase  in  volcanic  activity  during  the  past  two  to  four
decades  would, if  anything, produce  tropospheric  cooling  and
stratospheric warming, the reverse to what has occurred over this
period  (e.g., Figure  12.8).  Increases  in  solar  irradiance  could
account  for  some  of  the  observed  tropospheric  warming, but
mechanisms  by  which  this  could  cool  the  stratosphere  (e.g.,
through  changes  in  stratospheric  ozone)  remain  speculative.
Observed  increases  in  stratospheric  water  vapour  might  also
account  for  some  of  the  observed  stratospheric  cooling.
Estimated changes in solar radiative forcing over the 20th century
are  substantially  smaller  than  those  due  to  greenhouse  gas
forcing, unless  mechanisms  exist  which  enhance  the  effects  of
solar  radiation  changes  at  the  ground.  Palaeo-data  show  little
evidence  of  such  an  enhancement  at  the  surface  in  the  past.
Simulations based solely on the response to natural forcing (e.g.,

Figure 12.7a) are inconsistent with the observed climate record
even if the model-simulated response is allowed to scale up or
down  to  match  the  observations.  It  is  therefore  unlikely  that
natural forcing and internal variability together can explain the
instrumental temperature record.

Anthropogenic factors do provide an explanation of 20th century
temperature change.
All models produce a response pattern to combined greenhouse
gas  and  sulphate  aerosol  forcing  that  is  detectable  in  the  20th
century  surface  temperature  record  (e.g., Figures  12.10, 12.12
(one model produces an estimate of internal variability which is
not consistent with that observed)). Given that sulphate aerosol
forcing  is  negative, and  hence  tends  to  reduce  the  response,
detection of the response to the combined forcing indicates the
presence of a greenhouse gas signal that is at least as large as the
combined signal.

The effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is detected, despite
uncertainties in sulphate aerosol forcing and response.
The analysis used to derive Figures 12.10a  and 12.12, left box,
assumes that the ratio of the greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol
responses  in  each  model  is  correct.  Given  the  uncertainty  in
sulphate aerosol forcing, this may not be the case. Hence one must
also  consider  the  separate  responses  to  greenhouse  gases  and
aerosols  simultaneously. A  greenhouse  gas  signal  is  consistently
detected  in  the  observations  (e.g., Figure  12.10b,c, Figure  12.12
right  hand  boxes;  North  and  Wu, 2001;  Tett  et  al. 2000).  The
greenhouse gas responses are consistent with the observations in all
but one case. The two component studies all indicate a substantial
detectable greenhouse gas signal, despite uncertainties in aerosol
forcing. The spread of estimates of the sulphate signal emphasises
the uncertainty in sulphate aerosol forcing and response.

It is unlikely that detection studies have mistaken a natural signal
for an anthropogenic signal.
In order to demonstrate an anthropogenic contribution to climate,
it  is  necessary  to  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  detection
procedure  has  mistaken  part  or  all  of  a  natural  signal  for  an
anthropogenic  change.  On  physical  grounds, natural  forcing  is
unlikely  to  account  completely  for  the  observed  warming  over
the last three to five decades, given that it is likely that the overall
trend in natural forcing over most of the 20th century is small or
negative.  Several  studies  have  involved  three  or  more
components  − the  responses  to  greenhouse  gases, sulphate
aerosols  and  natural  (solar, volcanic  or  volcanic  and  solar)
forcing.  These  studies  all  detect  a  substantial  greenhouse  gas
contribution  over  the  last  fifty  years, though  in  one  case  the
estimated greenhouse gas amplitude is inconsistent with observa-
tions.  Thus  it  is  unlikely  that  we  have  misidentified  the  solar
signal completely as a greenhouse gas response, but uncertainty
in the amplitude of the response to natural forcing continues to
contribute to uncertainty in the size of the anthropogenic signal.

The detection methods used should not be sensitive to errors in the
amplitude of the global mean forcing or response.
Signal estimation methods (e.g., Figures 12.10, 12.11 and 12.12)

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

731

allow for errors in the amplitude of the response, so the results
should not be sensitive to errors in the magnitude of the forcing or
the  magnitude  of  the  simulated  model  response.  This  would
reduce the impact of uncertainty in indirect sulphate forcing on the
estimated greenhouse and net sulphate signal amplitudes, to the
extent  that  the  pattern  of  response  to  indirect  sulphate  forcing
resembles the pattern of response to direct sulphate forcing. Some
models  indicate  this  is  may  be  the  case, others  do  not, so  this
remains an important source of uncertainty. Note that if the spatio-
temporal pattern of response to indirect sulphate forcing were to
resemble the greenhouse response, it would lead to the amplitude
of the greenhouse response being underestimated in cases where
indirect  sulphate  forcing  has  not  been  included  in  the  model.
Detection and attribution results are also expected to be insensitive
to  all  but  the  largest  scale  details  of  radiative  forcing  patterns.
Detection is only possible at the largest spatial scales (e.g., Stott
and Tett, 1998). In addition, atmospheric motions and large-scale
feedbacks smooth out the response. All these arguments tend to
reduce the impact of the large uncertainty in the magnitude of the
forcing due to indirect sulphate aerosols. The inclusion of forcing
from additional aerosols (see Chapter 6) is unlikely to alter our
conclusion concerning the detection of a substantial greenhouse
gas signal, though it is likely to affect estimates of the sulphate
aerosol response. This is because part of the response to sulphate
aerosols can be considered as surrogate for other aerosols, even
though the patterns of forcing and response may differ on smaller
scales. In general, the estimates of global mean forcing for other
neglected factors are small (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.6). 

Studies of the changes in the vertical patterns of temperature also
indicate  that  there  has  been  an  anthropogenic  influence  on
climate over the last 35 years. 
One study finds that even when changes in stratospheric ozone
and solar irradiance are taken into account, there is a detectable
greenhouse gas signal in the vertical temperature record. 

Observed and simulated vertical lapse rate changes are inconsis-
tent  over  the  last  two  decades, but  there  is  an  anthropogenic
influence on tropospheric temperatures over a longer period.
Over  the  last  twenty  years, the  observed  warming  trend  in  the
lower  troposphere  has  been  smaller  than  at  the  surface.  This
contrasts  with  model  simulations  of  the  response  to  anthro-
pogenic greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols. Natural climate
variability and the influence of natural external forcing, such as
volcanism, can  explain  part  of  this  difference.  However, a
discrepancy  remains  that  cannot  be  accounted  for  with  current
climate models. The reduced warming in the lower troposphere
does  not, however, call  into  question  the  fact  that  the  surface
temperature  has  been  warming  over  the  satellite  period  (e.g.,
National Academy of Sciences, 2000). Over the longer period for
which radiosonde data are available, an anthropogenic influence
due to increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing stratospheric
ozone is detected in all studies.

Natural  factors  may  have  contributed  to  the  early  century
warming.
Most of the discussion in this section has been concerned with
evidence relating to a human effect on late 20th century climate.
The observed global mean surface temperature record shows two
main periods of warming. Some studies detect a solar influence
on surface temperature over the first five decades of the century,
with  perhaps  a  small  additional  warming  due  to  increases  in
greenhouse  gases.  One  study  suggests  that  the  early  warming
could  be  due  to  a  combination  of  anthropogenic  effects  and  a
highly unusual internal variation. Thus the early century warming
could be due to some combination of natural internal variability,
changes  in  solar  irradiance  and  some  anthropogenic  influence.
The additional warming in the second half-century is most likely
to be due to a substantial warming due to increases in greenhouse
gases, partially offset by cooling due to aerosols, and perhaps by
cooling due to natural factors towards the end of the period.

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

Appendix 12.1: Optimal Detection is Regression

The  detection  technique  that  has  been  used  in  most  “optimal
detection” studies  performed  to  date  has  several  equivalent
representations  (Hegerl  and  North, 1997;  Zwiers, 1999).  It  has
recently been recognised that it can be cast as a multiple regres-
sion problem with respect to generalised least squares (Allen and
Tett, 1999; see also Hasselmann, 1993, 1997) in which a field of
n “observations” y  is  represented  as  a  linear  combination  of
signal patterns g1,...,gm plus noise u

where  Cuu is  the  n×n covariance  matrix  of  the  noise
(Hasselmann, 1997, 1998; Allen  and  Tett, 1999;  Levine  and
Berliner, 1999). Generalisations allow for the incorporation of
signal uncertainties (see, for example, Allen et al., 2000b). A
schematic  two-dimensional  example  is  given  in  Box  12.1.  In
essence, the  amplitudes  are  estimated  by  giving  somewhat
greater weight to information in the low variance parts of the
field  of  observations.  The  uncertainty  of  this  estimate,
expressed as the m×m covariance matrix of Caa of ã, is given
by

(A12.1.3)

where G=(g1...gm) is the matrix composed of the signal patterns
and  a=(a1,...,am)T is  the  vector  composed  of  the  unknown
amplitudes. The field usually contains temperature observations,
arrayed  in  space, either  at  the  surface  as  grid  box  averages  of
surface temperature observations (typically 5×5 degrees; Santer
et  al., 1995;  Hegerl  et  al., 1997;  Tett  et  al., 1999), or  in  the
vertical as zonal averages of radiosonde observations (Karoly et
al., 1994; Santer et al., 1996a; Allen and Tett, 1999). The fields
are  masked  so  that  they  represent  only  those  regions  with
adequate data. The fields may also have a time dimension (Allen
and  Tett, 1999;  North  and  Stevens;  1998;  Stevens  and  North,
1996). Regardless of how the field is defined, its dimension n (the
total  number  of  observed  values  contained  in  any  one  single
realisation  of  the  field)  is  large. The  signal  patterns, which  are
obtained from climate models, and the residual noise field, have
the  same  dimension.  The  procedure  consists  of  efficiently
estimating  the  unknown  amplitudes  a from  observations  and
testing  the  null  hypotheses  that  they  are  zero.  In  the  event  of
rejection, testing the hypothesis that the amplitudes are unity for
some combination of signals performs the attribution consistency
test.  This  assumes, of  course, that  the  climate  model  signal
patterns  have  been  normalised.  When  the  signal  is  noise-free,
estimates of the amplitudes are given by

greater  than  zero.  However, “multiplicity” is  a  concern  when
making inferences in this way. For example, two signals that are
detected  at  the  α/2×100%  significance  level  may  not  be  jointly
detectable at this level. The attribution consistency test is passed
when the confidence ellipsoid contains the vector of units (1,...,1)T.

Appendix 12.2: Three Approaches to Optimal Detection

Optimal  detection  studies  come  in  several  variants  depending
upon how the time evolution of signal amplitude and structure is
treated. 

Fixed pattern studies (Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997, 2000a; Berliner
et al., 2000; Schnur, 2001) assume that the spatial structure of
the  signals  does  not  change  during  the  epoch  covered  by  the
instrumental  record.  This  type  of  study  searches  for  evidence
that the amplitudes of fixed anthropogenic signals are increasing
with time. The observed field y=y(t) that appears on the left hand
side of equation (A12.1.1) is typically a field of 30 to 50-year
moving  window  trends  computed  from  annual  mean  observa-
tions.  The  regression  equation  (A12.1.1)  is  solved  repeatedly
with  a  fixed  signal  matrix  G as  the  moving  30  to  50-year
window is stepped through the available record. 

Studies  with time-varying  patterns  allow  the  shape  of  the
signals, as well as their amplitudes, to evolve with time. Such
studies come in two flavours. 

The  space-time  approach  uses  enlarged  signal  vectors  that
consist  of  a  sequence  of  spatial  patterns  representing  the
evolution of the signal through a short epoch. For example, Tett
et al. (1999) use signal vectors composed of five spatial patterns
representing a sequence of decadal means. The enlarged signal
matrix  G=G(t)  evolves  with  time  as  the  5-decade  window  is
moved  one  decade  at  a  time.  The  observations  are  defined

similarly as extended vectors containing a sequence of observed
decadal  mean  temperature  patterns.  As  with  the  fixed  pattern
approach, a separate model is fitted for each 5-decade window
so that the evolution of the signal amplitudes can be studied.

The space-frequency approach (North et al., 1995) uses annual
mean signal patterns that evolve throughout the analysis period.
A  Fourier  transform  is  used  to  map  the  temporal  variation  of
each signal into the frequency domain. Only the low-frequency
Fourier  coefficients  representing  decadal-scale  variability  are
retained and gathered into a signal vector. The observations are
similarly  transformed.  The  selection  of  time-scales  that  is
effected by retaining only certain Fourier coefficients is a form
of  dimension  reduction  (see  Dimension  Reduction, Appendix
12.4) in the time domain. This is coupled with spatial dimension
reduction that must also be performed. The result approximates
the dimension reduction that is obtained by projecting observa-
tions in space and time on low order space-time EOFs (North et
al., 1995).  A  further  variation  on  this  theme  is  obtained  by
increasing  the  time  resolution  of  the  signals  and  the  data  by
using  monthly  rather  than  annual  means.  Climate  statistics,
including means, variances and covariances, have annual cycles
at  this  time  resolution, and  thus  dimension  reduction  must  be
performed with cyclo-stationary space-time EOFs (Kim and Wu,
2000).

Given the same amount of data to estimate covariance matrices,
the  space-time  and  space-frequency  approaches  will  sacrifice
spatial resolution for temporal resolution.

Appendix 12.3: Pattern Correlation Methods

The  pattern  correlation  methods  discussed  in  this  section  are
closely  related  to  optimal  detection  with  one  signal  pattern.
Pattern correlation studies use either a centred statistic, R, which
correlates observed and signal anomalies in space relative to their
respective spatial means, or an uncentred statistic, C (Barnett and
Schlesinger, 1987), that correlates these fields without removing
the spatial means. It has been argued that the latter is better suited
for detection, because it includes the response in the global mean,
while  the  former  is  more  appropriate  for  attribution  because  it
better  measures  the  similarity  between  spatial  patterns.  The
similarity  between  the  statistics  is  emphasised  by  the  fact  that
they  can  be  given  similar  matrix-vector  representations.  In  the
one  pattern  case, the  optimal  (regression)  estimate  of  signal
amplitude is given by

removes  the  spatial  means.  Note  that  area, mass  or  volume
weighting, as  appropriate, is  easily  incorporated  into  these
expressions. The main point is that each statistic is proportional
to the inner product with respect to a matrix “kernel” between
the signal pattern and the observations (Stephenson, 1997). In
contrast with the pattern correlation statistics, the optimal signal
amplitude  estimate, which  is  proportional  to  a  correlation
coefficient  using  the  so-called  Mahalonobis  kernel
(Stephenson, 1997), maximises the signal-to-noise ratio.

Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes

Appendix 12.4: Dimension Reduction

Estimation of the signal amplitudes, as well as the detection and
attribution  consistency  tests  on  the  amplitudes, requires  an
estimate of the covariance matrix Cuu of the residual noise field.
However, as  y typically  represents  climate  variation  on  time-
scales similar to the length of the observed instrumental record, it
is  difficult  to  estimate  the  covariance  matrix  reliably.  Thus  the
covariance matrix is often estimated from a long control simula-
tion. Even so, the number of independent realisations of u that are
available from a typical 1,000 to 2,000-year control simulation is
substantially smaller than the dimension of the field, and thus it is
not possible to estimate the full covariance matrix. The solution is
to  replace  the  full  fields  y, g1,...,gm and  u with  vectors  of
dimension k, where m<k<<n, containing indices of their projec-
tions onto the dominant patterns of variability f1,...,fk of u. These
patterns are usually taken to be the k highest variance EOFs of a
control run (North and Stevens, 1998; Allen and Tett, 1999; Tett et
al., 1999)  or  a  forced  simulation  (Hegerl  et  al., 1996, 1997;
Schnur, 2001).  Stott  and  Tett  (1998)  showed  with  a  “perfect
model” study that climate change in surface air temperature can
only be detected at very large spatial scales. Thus Tett et al. (1999)
reduce the spatial resolution to a few spherical harmonics prior to
EOF truncation. Kim et al. (1996) and Zwiers and Shen (1997)
examine  the  sampling  properties  of  spherical  harmonic  coeffi-
cients when they are estimated from sparse observing networks.

An important decision, therefore, is the choice of k. A key consid-
eration in the choice is that the variability of the residuals should
be consistent with the variability of the control simulation in the
dimensions  that  are  retained. Allen  and  Tett  (1999)  describe  a
simple  test  on  the  residuals  that  makes  this  consistency  check.
Rejection implies that the model-simulated variability is signifi-
cantly different from that of the residuals. This may happen when
the number of retained dimensions, k, is too large because higher
order  EOFs  may  contain  unrealistically  low  variance  due  to
sampling deficiencies or scales that are not well represented. In
this  situation, the  use  of  a  smaller  value  of  k  can  still  provide
consistent results: there is no need to require that model-simulated
variability  is  perfect  on  all  spatio-temporal  scales  for  it  to  be
adequate on the very large scales used for detection and attribu-
tion studies. However, failing the residual check of Allen and Tett
(1999)  could  also  indicate  that  the  model  does  not  have  the
correct timing or pattern of response (in which case the residuals
will  contain  forced  variability  that  is  not  present  in  the  control
regardless of the choice of k) or that the model does not simulate
the correct amount of internal variability, even at the largest scales
represented  by  the  low  order  EOFs.  In  this  case, there  is  no
satisfactory  choice  of  k.  Previous  authors  (e.g., Hegerl  et  al.,
1996, 1997; Stevens and North, 1996; North and Stevens, 1998)
have  made  this  choice  subjectively.  Nonetheless, experience  in
recent studies (Tett et al. 1999; Hegerl et al. 2000, 2001; Stott et
al., 2001) indicates that their choices were appropriate.

Appendix 12.5: Determining the Likelihood of Outcomes (p-
values)

Traditional  statistical  hypothesis  tests  are  performed  by
comparing the value of a detection statistic with an estimate of
its natural internal variability in the unperturbed climate. This
estimate  must  be  obtained  from  control  climate  simulations
because detection statistics typically measure change on time-
scales  that  are  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  length  of  the
available  instrumental  record  (see  Appendix  12.4).  Most
“optimal” detection  studies  use  two  data  sets  from  control
climate  simulations, one  that  is  used  to  develop  the  optimal
detection  statistic  and  the  other  to  independently  estimate  its
natural variability. This is necessary to avoid underestimating
natural  variability.  The  p-value  that  is  used  in  testing  the  no
signal null hypothesis is often computed by assuming that both
the observed and simulated projections on signal patterns are

normally distributed. This is convenient, and is thought to be a
reasonable  assumption  given  the  variables  and  the  time  and
space  scales  used  for  detection  and  attribution.  However, it
leads  to  concern  that  very  small  p-values  may  be  unreliable,
because they correspond to events that have not been explored
by  the  model  in  the  available  control  integrations  (Allen  and
Tett, 1999).  They  therefore  recommend  that  p-values  be
limited to values that are consistent with the range visited in
the available control integrations. A non-parametric approach
is  to  estimate  the  p-value  by  comparing  the  value  of  the
detection statistic with an empirical estimate of its distribution
obtained  from  the  second  control  simulation  data  set.  If
parametric methods are used to estimate the p-value, then very
small values should be reported as being less than 1/np where
np represents  the  equivalent  number  of  independent  real-
isations  of  the  detection  statistic  that  are  contained  in  the
second control integration.

Climate Scenario Development

Executive Summary 

The Purpose of Climate Scenarios
A climate scenario is a plausible representation of future climate
that  has  been  constructed  for  explicit  use  in  investigating  the
potential  impacts  of  anthropogenic  climate  change.  Climate
scenarios often make use of climate projections (descriptions of
the  modelled  response  of  the  climate  system  to  scenarios  of
greenhouse  gas  and  aerosol  concentrations), by  manipulating
model outputs and combining them with observed climate data. 
This new chapter for the IPCC assesses the methods used to
develop climate scenarios. Impact assessments have a very wide
range  of  scenario  requirements, ranging  from  global  mean
estimates of temperature and sea level, through continental-scale
descriptions  of  changes  in  mean  monthly  climate, to  point  or
catchment-level detail about future changes in daily or even sub-
daily climate.

The  science  of  climate  scenario  development  acts  as  an
important bridge from the climate science of Working Group I
to  the  science  of  impact, adaptation  and  vulnerability  assess-
ment, considered  by  Working  Group  II.  It  also  has  a  close
dependence  on  emissions  scenarios, which  are  discussed  by
Working Group III.

Methods for Constructing Scenarios
Useful  information  about  possible  future  climates  and  their
impacts  has  been  obtained  using  various  scenario  construction
methods.  These  include  climate  model  based  approaches,
temporal  and  spatial  analogues, incremental  scenarios  for
sensitivity studies, and expert judgement. This chapter identifies
advantages  and  disadvantages  of  these  different  methods  (see
Table 13.1). 

All these methods can continue to serve a useful role in the
provision of scenarios for impact assessment, but it is likely that
the major advances in climate scenario construction will be made
through  the  refinement  and  extension  of  climate  model  based
approaches.

Each  new  advance  in  climate  model  simulations  of  future
climate  has  stimulated  new  techniques  for  climate  scenario
construction.  There  are  now  numerous  techniques  available  for
scenario  construction, the  majority  of  which  ultimately  depend
upon  results  obtained  from  general  circulation  model  (GCM)
experiments. 

Representing the Cascade of Uncertainty
Uncertainties  will  remain  inherent  in  predicting  future  climate
change, even though some uncertainties are likely to be narrowed
with  time.  Consequently, a  range  of  climate  scenarios  should
usually be considered in conducting impact assessments.

There is a cascade of uncertainties in future climate predic-
tions  which  includes  unknown  future  emissions  of  greenhouse
gases and aerosols, the conversion of emissions to atmospheric
concentrations and to radiative forcing of the climate, modelling
the response of the climate system to forcing, and methods for
regionalising GCM results.

Scenario construction techniques can be usefully contrasted
according  to  the  sources  of  uncertainty  that  they  address  and

741

those that they ignore. These techniques, however, do not always
provide consistent results. For example, simple methods based on
direct GCM changes often represent model-to-model differences
in simulated climate change, but do not address the uncertainty
associated with how these changes are expressed at fine spatial
scales. With regionalisation approaches, the reverse is often true.
A  number  of  methods  have  emerged  to  assist  with  the
quantification  and  communication  of  uncertainty  in  climate
scenarios.  These  include  pattern-scaling  techniques  to  inter-
polate/extrapolate between results of model experiments, climate
scenario generators, risk assessment frameworks and the use of
expert judgement. The development of new or refined scenario
construction techniques that can account for multiple uncertain-
ties merits further investigation.

Representing High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Information
The incorporation of climate changes at high spatial (e.g., tens of
kilometres)  and  temporal  (e.g., daily)  resolution  in  climate
scenarios currently remains largely within the research domain of
climate  scenario  development.  Scenarios  containing  such  high
resolution information have not yet been widely used in compre-
hensive policy relevant impact assessments.

Preliminary evidence suggests that coarse spatial resolution
AOGCM  (Atmosphere-Ocean  General  Circulation  Model)
information  for  impact  studies  needs  to  be  used  cautiously  in
regions  characterised  by  pronounced  sub-GCM  grid  scale
variability  in  forcings.  The  use  of  suitable  regionalisation
techniques  may  be  important  to  enhance  the  AOGCM  results
over such regions.

Incorporating  higher  resolution  information  in  climate
scenarios can substantially alter the assessment of impacts. The
incorporation of such information in scenarios is likely to become
increasingly  common  and  further  evaluation  of  the  relevant
methods and their added value in impact assessment is warranted. 

Representing Extreme Events
Extreme  climate/weather  events  are  very  important  for  most
climate change impacts. Changes in the occurrence and intensity
of  extremes  should  be  included  in  climate  scenarios  whenever
possible.

Some extreme events are easily or implicitly incorporated in
climate  scenarios  using  conventional  techniques.  It  is  more
difficult to produce scenarios of complex events, such as tropical
cyclones  and  ice  storms, which  may  require  specialised
techniques. This constitutes an important methodological gap in
scenario  development.  The  large  uncertainty  regarding  future
changes  in  some  extreme  events  exacerbates  the  difficulty  in
incorporating such changes in climate scenarios.

Applying Climate Scenarios in Impact Assessments
There  is  no  single  “best” scenario  construction  method
appropriate  for  all  applications.  In  each  case, the  appropriate
method is determined by the context and the application of the
scenario.

The choice of method constrains the sources of uncertainty
that can be addressed. Relatively simple techniques, such as those
that rely on scaled or unscaled GCM changes, may well be the

742

Climate Scenario Development

most  appropriate  for  applications  in  integrated  assessment
modelling or for informing policy; more sophisticated techniques,
such  as  regional  climate  modelling  or  conditioned  stochastic
weather generation, are often necessary for applications involving
detailed regional modelling of climate change impacts.

Improving Information Required for Scenario Development
Improvements  in  global  climate  modelling  will  bring  a
variety  of  benefits  to  most  climate  scenario  development

methods. A more diverse set of model experiments, such as
AOGCMs run under a broader range of forcings and at higher
resolutions, and  regional  climate  models  run  either  in
ensemble mode or for longer time periods, will allow a wider
range of uncertainty to be represented in climate scenarios. In
addition, incorporation  of  some  of  the  physical, biological
and  socio-economic  feedbacks  not  currently  simulated  in
global  models  will  improve  the  consistency  of  different
scenario elements.

13.1 Introduction

13.1.1 Definition and Nature of Scenarios

For  the  purposes  of  this  report, a  climate  scenario  refers  to  a
plausible future climate that has been constructed for explicit use
in  investigating  the  potential  consequences  of  anthropogenic
climate change. Such climate scenarios should represent future
conditions that account for both human-induced climate change
and natural climate variability. We distinguish a climate scenario
from a climate projection (discussed in Chapters 9 and 10), which
refers to a description of the response of the climate system to a
scenario of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, as simulated
by  a  climate  model.  Climate  projections  alone  rarely  provide
sufficient  information  to  estimate  future  impacts  of  climate
change;  model  outputs  commonly  have  to  be  manipulated  and
combined with observed climate data to be usable, for example,
as inputs to impact models.

743

To  further  illustrate  this  point, Box  13.1  presents  a  simple
example  of  climate  scenario  construction  based  on  climate
projections.  The  example  also  illustrates  some  other  common
considerations in performing an impact assessment that touch on
issues discussed later in this chapter.

We also distinguish between a climate scenario and a climate
change  scenario.  The  latter  term  is  sometimes  used  in  the
scientific  literature  to  denote  a  plausible  future  climate.
However, this term should strictly refer to a representation of the
difference between some plausible future climate and the current
or  control  climate  (usually  as  represented  in  a  climate  model)
(see Box 13.1, Figure 13.1a). A climate change scenario can be
viewed  as  an  interim  step  toward  constructing  a  climate
scenario.  Usually  a  climate  scenario  requires  combining  the
climate change scenario with a description of the current climate
as  represented  by  climate  observations  (Figure  13.1b).  In  a
climate impacts context, it is the contrasting effects of these two
climates  –  one  current  (the  observed  “baseline” climate), one

Box 13.1: Example of scenario construction.

Example of basic scenario construction for an impact study: the case of climate change and world food supply (Rosenzweig and
Parry, 1994).

Aim of the study
The objective of this study was to estimate how global food supply might be affected by greenhouse gas induced climate change
up to the year 2060. The method adopted involved estimating the change in yield of major crop staples under various scenarios
using crop models at 112 representative sites distributed across the major agricultural regions of the world. Yield change estimates
were assumed to be applicable to large regions to produce estimates of changes in total production which were then input to a global
trade model. Using assumptions about future population, economic growth, trading conditions and technological progress, the trade
model  estimated  plausible  prices  of  food  commodities  on  the  international  market  given  supply  as  defined  by  the  production
estimates. This information was then used to define the number of people at risk from hunger in developing countries.

Scenario information
Each of the stages of analysis required scenario information to be provided, including:
• scenarios of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, affecting crop growth and water use, as an input to the crop models;
• climate observations and scenarios of future climate, for the crop model simulations;
• adaptation scenarios (e.g., new crop varieties, adjusted farm management) as inputs to the crop models;
• scenarios of regional population and global trading policy as an input to the trade model.

To the extent possible, the scenarios were mutually consistent, such that scenarios of population (United Nations medium range
estimate) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (moderate growth) were broadly in line with the transient scenario of greenhouse gas
emissions (based on the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) scenario A, see Hansen et al., 1988), and hence CO2 concen-
trations.  Similarly, the  climate  scenarios  were  based  on  2×CO2 equilibrium  GCM  projections  from  three  models, where  the
radiative  forcing  of  climate  was  interpreted  as  the  combined  concentrations  of  CO2  (555  ppm)  and  other  greenhouse  gases
(contributing about 15% of the change in forcing) equivalent to a doubling of CO2, assumed to occur in about 2060.

Construction of the climate scenario
Since projections of current (and hence future) regional climate from the GCM simulations were not accurate enough to be used
directly  as  an  input  to  the  crop  model, modelled  changes  in  climate  were  applied  as  adjustments  to  the  observed  climate  at  a
location. Climate change by 2060 was computed as the difference (air temperature) or ratio (precipitation and solar radiation) of
monthly mean climate between the GCM (unforced) control and 2×CO2 simulations at GCM grid boxes coinciding with the crop
modelling sites (Figure 13.1b). These estimates were used to adjust observed time-series of daily climate for the baseline period
(usually 1961 to 1990) at each site (Figure 13.1b,c). Crop model simulations were conducted for the baseline climate and for each
of the three climate scenarios, with and without CO2 enrichment (to estimate the relative contributions of CO2 and climate to crop
yield changes), and assuming different levels of adaptation capacity.

future  (the  climate  scenario)  –  on  the  exposure  unit1 that
determines the impact of the climate change (Figure 13.1c).

A treatment of climate scenario development, in this specific
sense, has  been  largely  absent  in  the  earlier  IPCC Assessment
Reports.  The  subject  has  been  presented  in  independent  IPCC
Technical  Guidelines  documents  (IPCC, 1992, 1994), which
were  briefly  summarised  in  the  Second Assessment  Report  of
Working Group II (Carter et al., 1996b). These documents, while
serving a useful purpose in providing guidelines for scenario use,

1 An exposure unit is an activity, group, region or resource exposed to
significant climatic variations (IPCC, 1994).

did not fully address the science of climate scenario development.
This may be, in part, because the field has been slow to develop
and  because  only  recently  has  a  critical  mass  of  important
research issues coalesced and matured such that a full chapter is
now warranted. 

The  chapter  also  serves  as  a  bridge  between  this  Report  of
Working  Group  I  and  the  IPCC  Third  Assessment  Report  of
Working  Group  II  (IPCC, 2001)  (hereafter  TAR  WG  II)  of
climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. As such it
also embodies the maturation in the IPCC assessment process –
that is, a recognition of the interconnections among the different
segments  of  the  assessment  process  and  a  desire  to  further
integrate these segments. Chapter 3 performs a similar role in the
TAR WG II (Carter and La Rovere, 2001) also discussing climate
scenarios, but  treating, in  addition, all  other  scenarios  (socio-
economic, land use, environmental, etc.) needed for undertaking
policy-relevant impact assessment. Chapter 3 serves in part as the
other half of the bridge between the two Working Group Reports.
Scenarios  are  neither  predictions  nor  forecasts  of  future
conditions. Rather they describe alternative plausible futures that
conform to sets of circumstances or constraints within which they
occur  (Hammond, 1996).  The  true  purpose  of  scenarios  is  to
illuminate uncertainty, as they help in determining the possible
ramifications of an issue (in this case, climate change) along one
or more plausible (but indeterminate) paths (Fisher, 1996). 

Not all possibly imaginable futures can be considered viable
scenarios of future climate. For example, most climate scenarios
include the characteristic of increased lower tropospheric temper-
ature  (except  in  some  isolated  regions  and  physical  circum-
stances), since most climatologists have very high confidence in
that  characteristic  (Schneider  et  al., 1990;  Mahlman, 1997).
Given our present state of knowledge, a scenario that portrayed
global  tropospheric  cooling  for  the  21st  century  would  not  be
viable. We shall see in this chapter that what constitutes a viable
scenario  of  future  climate  has  evolved  along  with  our
understanding of the climate system and how this understanding
might develop in the future.

It is worth noting that the development of climate scenarios
predates  the  issue  of  global  warming.  In  the  mid-1970s, for
example, when a concern emerged regarding global cooling due
to  the  possible  effect  of  aircraft  on  the  stratosphere, simple
incremental  scenarios  of  climate  change  were  formulated  to
evaluate  what  the  possible  effects  might  be  worldwide  (CIAP,
1975).

The purpose of this chapter is to assess the current state of
climate  scenario  development.  It  discusses  research  issues  that
are addressed by researchers who develop climate scenarios and
that must be considered by impacts researchers when they select
scenarios  for  use  in  impact  assessments.  This  chapter  is  not
concerned, however, with  presenting  a  comprehensive  set  of
climate scenarios for the IPCC Third Assessment Report.

13.1.2  Climate Scenario Needs of the Impacts Community

The  specific  climate  scenario  needs  of  the  impacts  community
vary, depending on the geographic region considered, the type of
impact, and the purpose of the study. For example, distinctions

Climate Scenario Development

745

can  be  made  between  scenario  needs  for  research  in  climate
scenario development and in the methods of conducting impact
assessment (e.g., Woo, 1992; Mearns et al., 1997) and scenario
needs  for  direct  application  in  policy  relevant  impact  and
integrated  assessments  (e.g., Carter  et  al., 1996a;  Smith  et  al.,
1996; Hulme and Jenkins, 1998).

The  types  of  climate  variables  needed  for  quantitative
impacts  studies  vary  widely  (e.g., White, 1985).  However, six
“cardinal” variables  can  be  identified  as  the  most  commonly
requested: maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation,
incident  solar  radiation, relative  humidity, and  wind  speed.
Nevertheless, this  list  is  far  from  exhaustive.  Other  climate  or
climate-related  variables  of  importance  may  include  CO2
concentration, sea-ice extent, mean sea level pressure, sea level,
and  storm  surge  frequencies.  A  central  issue  regarding  any
climate  variable  of  importance  for  impact  assessment  is
determining at what spatial and temporal scales the variable in
question can sensibly be provided, in comparison to the scales
most  desired  by  the  impacts  community.  From  an  impacts
perspective, it  is  usually  desirable  to  have  a  fair  amount  of
regional  detail  of  future  climate  and  to  have  a  sense  of  how
climate variability (from short to long time-scales) may change.
But the need for this sort of detail is very much a function of the
scale  and  purpose  of  the  particular  impact  assessment.
Moreover, the availability of the output from climate models and
the  advisability  of  using  climate  model  results  at  particular
scales, from  the  point  of  view  of  the  climate  modellers,
ultimately determines what scales can and should be used.

Scenarios should also provide adequate quantitative measures
of uncertainty. The sources of uncertainty are many, including the

trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions in the future, their conver-
sion into atmospheric concentrations, the range of responses of
various  climate  models  to  a  given  radiative  forcing  and  the
method of constructing high resolution information from global
climate model outputs (Pittock, 1995; see Figure 13.2). For many
purposes, simply defining a single climate future is insufficient
and  unsatisfactory.  Multiple  climate  scenarios  that  address  at
least one, or preferably several sources of uncertainty allow these
uncertainties  to  be  quantified  and  explicitly  accounted  for  in
impact assessments. Moreover, a further important requirement
for  impact  assessments  is  to  ensure  consistency  is  achieved
among  various  scenario  components, such  as  between  climate
change, sea level rise and the concentration of actual (as opposed
to equivalent) CO2 implied by a particular emissions scenario. 

As mentioned above, climate scenarios that are developed for
impacts  applications  usually  require  that  some  estimate  of
climate change be combined with baseline observational climate
data, and  the  demand  for  more  complete  and  sophisticated
observational data sets of climate has grown in recent years. The
important considerations for the baseline include the time period
adopted  as  well  as  the  spatial  and  temporal  resolution  of  the
baseline data. 

Much  of  this  chapter  is  devoted  to  assessing  how  and  how

successfully these needs and requirements are currently met.

13.2  Types of Scenarios of Future Climate

Four types of climate scenario that have been applied in impact
assessments  are  introduced  in  this  section.  The  most  common
scenario  type  is  based  on  outputs  from  climate  models  and
receives most attention in this chapter. The other three types have
usually  been  applied  with  reference  to  or  in  conjunction  with
model-based  scenarios, namely: incremental  scenarios  for
sensitivity studies, analogue scenarios, and a general category of
“other scenarios”. The origins of these scenarios and their mutual
linkages are depicted in Figure 13.3.

The  suitability  of  each  type  of  scenario  for  use  in  policy-
relevant  impact  assessment  can  be  assessed  according  to  five
criteria adapted from Smith and Hulme (1998):

1. Consistency at regional level with global projections. Scenario
changes in regional climate may lie outside the range of global
mean changes but should be consistent with theory and model-
based results.

2. Physical plausibility and realism. Changes in climate should
be physically plausible, such that changes in different climatic
variables are mutually consistent and credible.

3.  Appropriateness of  information  for  impact  assessments.
Scenarios  should  present  climate  changes  at  an  appropriate
temporal and spatial scale, for a sufficient number of variables,
and over an adequate time horizon to allow for impact assess-
ments.

4.  Representativeness of  the  potential  range  of  future  regional

climate change.

ered  in  developing  climate  and  related  scenarios  for  climate  change
impact, adaptation and mitigation assessment.

5. Accessibility. The information required for developing climate
scenarios should be readily available and easily accessible for
use in impact assessments.

the baseline climate and common types of scenario (see text for details). Grey shading encloses the typical components of climate scenario generators. 

A  summary  of  the  major  advantages  and  disadvantages  of
different scenario development methods, based on these criteria,
is  presented  in  Table  13.1.  The  relative  significance  of  the
advantages and disadvantages is highly application dependent.

13.2.1  Incremental Scenarios for Sensitivity Studies

Incremental  scenarios  describe  techniques  where  particular
climatic  (or  related)  elements  are  changed  incrementally  by
plausible  though  arbitrary  amounts  (e.g., +1, +2, +3, +4°C
change  in  temperature). Also  referred  to  as  synthetic  scenarios
(IPCC, 1994), they are commonly applied to study the sensitivity
of an exposure unit to a wide range of variations in climate, often
according to a qualitative interpretation of projections of future
regional  climate  from  climate  model  simulations  (“guided
sensitivity  analysis”, see  IPCC-TGCIA, 1999).  Incremental
scenarios  facilitate  the  construction  of  response  surfaces  –
graphical  devices  for  plotting  changes  in  climate  against  some

measure  of  impact  (for  example  see  Figure  13.9b)  which  can
assist  in  identifying  critical  thresholds  or  discontinuities  of
response  to  a  changing  climate.  Other  types  of  scenarios  (e.g.,
based  on  model  outputs)  can  be  superimposed  on  a  response
surface  and  the  significance  of  their  impacts  readily  evaluated
(e.g., Fowler, 1999).  Most  studies  have  adopted  incremental
scenarios of constant changes throughout the year (e.g., Terjung
et al., 1984; Rosenzweig et al., 1996), but some have introduced
seasonal and spatial variations in the changes (e.g., Whetton et
al., 1993;  Rosenthal  et  al., 1995)  and  others  have  examined
arbitrary  changes  in  interannual, within-month  and  diurnal
variability as well as changes in the mean (e.g., Williams et al.,
1988; Mearns et al., 1992; Semenov and Porter, 1995; Mearns et
al., 1996).

Incremental  scenarios  provide  information  on  an  ordered
range of climate changes and can readily be applied in a consis-
tent and replicable way in different studies and regions, allowing
for direct intercomparison of results. However, such scenarios do

not  necessarily  present  a  realistic  set  of  changes  that  are
physically  plausible.  They  are  usually  adopted  for  exploring
system  sensitivity  prior  to  the  application  of  more  credible,
model-based  scenarios  (Rosenzweig  and  Iglesias, 1994;  Smith
and Hulme, 1998).

13.2.2  Analogue Scenarios

Analogue  scenarios  are  constructed  by  identifying  recorded
climate regimes which may resemble the future climate in a given
region. Both spatial and temporal analogues have been used in
constructing climate scenarios. 

13.2.2.1  Spatial analogues
Spatial  analogues  are  regions  which  today  have  a  climate
analogous to that anticipated in the study region in the future. For
example, to  project  future  grass  growth, Bergthórsson  et  al.
(1988)  used  northern  Britain  as  a  spatial  analogue  for  the
potential  future  climate  over  Iceland.  Similarly, Kalkstein  and
Greene (1997) used Atlanta as a spatial analogue of New York in
a heat/mortality study for the future. Spatial analogues have also
been  exploited  along  altitudinal  gradients  to  project  vegetation
composition, snow conditions for skiing, and avalanche risk (e.g.,
Beniston and Price, 1992; Holten and Carey, 1992; Gyalistras et
al., 1997).  However, the  approach  is  severely  restricted  by  the
frequent  lack  of  correspondence  between  other  important
features (both climatic and non-climatic) of a study region and its
spatial analogue (Arnell et al., 1990). Thus, spatial analogues are
seldom applied as scenarios, per se. Rather, they are valuable for
validating  the  extrapolation  of  impact  models  by  providing
information  on  the  response  of  systems  to  climatic  conditions
falling  outside  the  range  currently  experienced  at  a  study
location.

13.2.2.2  Temporal analogues
Temporal analogues make use of climatic information from the
past  as  an  analogue  for  possible  future  climate  (Webb  and
Wigley, 1985;  Pittock, 1993).  They  are  of  two  types: palaeo-
climatic analogues and instrumentally based analogues.

Palaeoclimatic analogues are based on reconstructions of past
climate from fossil evidence, such as plant or animal remains and
sedimentary  deposits.  Two  periods  have  received  particular
attention (Budyko, 1989; Shabalova and Können, 1995): the mid-
Holocene  (about  5  to  6  ky  BP2)  and  the  Last  (Eemian)
Interglacial  (about  120  to  130  ky  BP).  During  these  periods,
mean global temperatures were as warm as or warmer than today
(see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4), perhaps resembling temperatures
anticipated  during  the  21st  century.  Palaeoclimatic  analogues
have been adopted extensively in the former Soviet Union (e.g.,
Frenzel  et  al., 1992;  Velichko  et  al., 1995a,b;  Anisimov  and
Nelson, 1996), as well as elsewhere (e.g., Kellogg and Schware,
1981;  Pittock  and  Salinger, 1982).  The  major  disadvantage  of
using palaeoclimatic analogues for climate scenarios is that the
causes of past changes in climate (e.g., variations in the Earth’s
orbit about the Sun; continental configuration) are different from

2 ky BP = thousand years before present.

those  posited  for  the  enhanced  greenhouse  effect, and  the
resulting regional and seasonal patterns of climate change may be
quite  different  (Crowley, 1990;  Mitchell, 1990). There  are  also
large  uncertainties  about  the  quality  of  many  palaeoclimatic
reconstructions (Covey, 1995). However, these scenarios remain
useful for providing insights about the vulnerability of systems to
abrupt climate change (e.g., Severinghaus et al., 1998) and to past
El  Niño-Southern  Oscillation  (ENSO)  extremes  (e.g., Fagan,
1999;  Rodbell  et  al., 1999).  They  also  can  provide  valuable
information for testing the ability of climate models to reproduce
past climate fluctuations (see Chapter 8).

Periods of observed global scale warmth during the historical
period  have  also  been  used  as  analogues  of  a  greenhouse  gas
induced warmer world (Wigley et al., 1980). Such scenarios are
usually  constructed  by  estimating  the  difference  between  the
regional climate during the warm period and that of the long-term
average  or  a  similarly  selected  cold  period  (e.g., Lough  et  al.,
1983). An alternative approach is to select the past period on the
basis not only of the observed climatic conditions but also of the
recorded  impacts  (e.g., Warrick, 1984;  Williams  et  al., 1988;
Rosenberg  et  al., 1993;  Lapin  et  al., 1995). A  further  method
employs observed atmospheric circulation patterns as analogues
(e.g., Wilby  et  al., 1994).  The  advantage  of  the  analogue
approach is that the changes in climate were actually observed
and  so, by  definition, are  internally  consistent  and  physically
plausible. Moreover, the approach can yield useful insights into
past sensitivity and adaptation to climatic variations (Magalhães
and Glantz, 1992). The major objection to these analogues is that
climate anomalies during the past century have been fairly minor
compared to anticipated future changes, and in many cases the
anomalies  were  probably  associated  with  naturally  occurring
changes  in  atmospheric  circulation  rather  than  changes  in
greenhouse  gas  concentrations  (e.g., Glantz, 1988;  Pittock,
1989).

13.2.3 Scenarios Based on Outputs from Climate Models

Climate  models  at  different  spatial  scales  and  levels  of
complexity  provide  the  major  source  of  information  for
constructing scenarios. GCMs and a hierarchy of simple models
produce  information  at  the  global  scale.  These  are  discussed
further below and assessed in detail in Chapters 8 and 9. At the
regional scale there are several methods for obtaining sub-GCM
grid  scale  information.  These  are  detailed  in  Chapter  10  and
summarised in Section 13.4.

13.2.3.1  Scenarios from General Circulation Models
The most common method of developing climate scenarios for
quantitative  impact  assessments  is  to  use  results  from  GCM
experiments.  GCMs  are  the  most  advanced  tools  currently
available for simulating the response of the global climate system
to changing atmospheric composition.

All of the earliest GCM-based scenarios developed for impact
assessment  in  the  1980s  were  based  on  equilibrium-response
experiments  (e.g., Emanuel  et  al., 1985;  Rosenzweig, 1985;
Gleick, 1986;  Parry  et  al., 1988).  However, most  of  these
scenarios  contained  no  explicit  information  about  the  time  of

Climate Scenario Development

749

realisation of changes, although time-dependency was introduced
in some studies using pattern-scaling techniques (e.g., Santer et
al., 1990; see Section 13.5). 

The  evolving  (transient)  pattern  of  climate  response  to
gradual changes in atmospheric composition was introduced into
climate scenarios using outputs from coupled AOGCMs from the
early 1990s onwards. Recent AOGCM simulations (see Chapter
9, Table 9.1) begin by modelling historical forcing by greenhouse
gases  and  aerosols  from  the  late  19th  or  early  20th  century
onwards. Climate scenarios based on these simulations are being
increasingly adopted in impact studies (e.g., Neilson et al., 1997;
Downing et al., 2000) along with scenarios based on ensemble
simulations  (e.g., papers  in  Parry  and  Livermore, 1999)  and
scenarios  accounting  for  multi-decadal  natural  climatic
variability from long AOGCM control simulations (e.g., Hulme
et al., 1999a).

There  are  several  limitations  that  restrict  the  usefulness  of
AOGCM outputs for impact assessment: (i) the large resources
required to undertake GCM simulations and store their outputs,
which  have  restricted  the  range  of  experiments  that  can  be
conducted  (e.g., the  range  of  radiative  forcings  assumed);  (ii)
their  coarse  spatial  resolution  compared  to  the  scale  of  many
impact  assessments  (see  Section  13.4);  (iii)  the  difficulty  of
distinguishing an anthropogenic signal from the noise of natural
internal model variability (see Section 13.5); and (iv) the differ-
ence in climate sensitivity between models. 

13.2.3.2  Scenarios from simple climate models
Simple climate models are simplified global models that attempt
to reproduce the large-scale behaviour of AOGCMs (see Chapter
9). While they are seldom able to represent the non-linearities of
some processes that are captured by more complex models, they
have the advantage that multiple simulations can be conducted
very  rapidly, enabling  an  exploration  of  the  climatic  effects  of
alternative scenarios of radiative forcing, climate sensitivity and
other  parametrized  uncertainties  (IPCC, 1997).  Outputs  from
these models have been used in conjunction with GCM informa-
tion  to  develop  scenarios  using  pattern-scaling  techniques  (see
Section  13.5).  They  have  also  been  used  to  construct  regional
greenhouse  gas  stabilisation  scenarios  (e.g., Gyalistras  and
Fischlin, 1995).  Simple  climate  models  are  used  in  climate
scenario generators (see Section 13.5.2) and in some integrated
assessment models (see Section 13.6). 

13.2.4  Other Types of Scenarios

Three additional types of climate scenarios have also been adopted
in  impact  studies.  The  first  type  involves  extrapolating  ongoing
trends in climate that have been observed in some regions and that
appear to be consistent with model-based projections of climate
change  (e.g., Jones  et  al., 1999).  There  are  obvious  dangers  in
relying  on  extrapolated  trends, and  especially  in  assuming  that
recent trends are due to anthropogenic forcing rather than natural
variability (see Chapters 2 and 12). However, if current trends in
climate are pointing strongly in one direction, it may be difficult to
defend the credibility of scenarios that posit a trend in the opposite
direction, especially over a short projection period.

A second type of scenario, which has some resemblance to
the  first, uses  empirical  relationships  between  regional  climate
and  global  mean  temperature  from  the  instrumental  record  to
extrapolate  future  regional  climate  on  the  basis  of  projected
global or hemispheric mean temperature change (e.g. Vinnikov
and Groisman, 1979; Anisimov and Poljakov, 1999). Again, this
method relies on the assumption that past relationships between
local  and  broad-scale  climate  are  also  applicable  to  future
conditions.

A  third  type  of  scenario  is  based  on  expert  judgement,
whereby  estimates  of  future  climate  change  are  solicited  from
climate  scientists, and  the  results  are  sampled  to  obtain
probability  density  functions  of  future  change  (NDU, 1978;
Morgan and Keith, 1995; Titus and Narayanan, 1996; Kuikka and
Varis, 1997; Tol and de Vos, 1998). The main criticism of expert
judgement is its inherent subjectivity, including problems of the
representativeness of the scientists sampled and likely biases in
questionnaire design and analysis of the responses (Stewart and
Glantz, 1985).  Nevertheless, since  uncertainties  in  estimates  of
future  climate  are  inevitable, any  moves  towards  expressing
future  climate  in  probabilistic  terms  will  necessarily  embrace
some elements of subjective judgement (see Section 13.5). 

13.3  Defining the Baseline

A baseline period is needed to define the observed climate with
which climate change information is usually combined to create
a climate scenario. When using climate model results for scenario
construction, the baseline also serves as the reference period from
which the modelled future change in climate is calculated. 

13.3.1  The Choice of Baseline Period

The  choice  of  baseline  period  has  often  been  governed  by
availability  of  the  required  climate  data.  Examples  of  adopted
baseline  periods  include  1931  to  1960  (Leemans  and  Solomon,
1993), 1951  to  1980  (Smith  and  Pitts, 1997), or  1961  to  1990
(Kittel et al., 1995; Hulme et al., 1999b).

There may be climatological reasons to favour earlier baseline
periods over later ones (IPCC, 1994). For example, later periods
such as 1961 to 1990 are likely to have larger anthropogenic trends
embedded  in  the  climate  data, especially  the  effects  of  sulphate
aerosols over regions such as Europe and eastern USA (Karl et al.,
1996). In this regard, the “ideal” baseline period would be in the
19th century when anthropogenic effects on global climate were
negligible. Most impact assessments, however, seek to determine
the  effect  of  climate  change  with  respect  to  “the  present”, and
therefore recent baseline periods such as 1961 to 1990 are usually
favoured.  A  further  attraction  of  using  1961  to  1990  is  that
observational climate data coverage and availability are generally
better for this period compared to earlier ones.

Whatever  baseline  period  is  adopted, it  is  important  to
acknowledge  that  there  are  differences  between  climatological
averages based on century-long data (e.g., Legates and Wilmott,
1990)  and  those  based  on  sub-periods.  Moreover, different  30-
year periods have been shown to exhibit differences in regional
annual  mean  baseline  temperature  and  precipitation  of  up  to

750

Climate Scenario Development

±0.5ºC and ±15% respectively (Hulme and New, 1997; Visser et
al., 2000; see also Chapter 2). 

13.3.2  The Adequacy of Baseline Climatological Data

The adequacy of observed baseline climate data sets can only be
evaluated in the context of particular climate scenario construction
methods, since  different  methods  have  differing  demands  for
baseline climate data. 

There  are  an  increasing  number  of  gridded  global  (e.g.,
Leemans and Cramer, 1991; New et al., 1999) and national (e.g.,
Kittel et al., 1995, 1997; Frei and Schär, 1998) climate data sets
describing  mean  surface  climate, although  few  describe  inter-
annual climate variability (see Kittel et al., 1997; Xie and Arkin,
1997; New et al., 2000). Differences between alternative gridded
regional  or  global  baseline  climate  data  sets  may  be  large, and
these  may  induce  non-trivial  differences  in  climate  change
impacts that use climate scenarios incorporating different baseline
climate  data  (e.g., Arnell, 1999).  These  differences  may  be  as
much  a  function  of  different  interpolation  methods  and  station
densities  as  they  are  of  errors  in  observations  or  the  result  of
sampling  different  time  periods  (Hulme  and  New, 1997;  New,
1999).  A  common  problem  that  some  methods  endeavour  to
correct is systematic biases in station locations (e.g., towards low
elevation sites). The adequacy of different techniques (e.g., Daly
et al., 1994; Hutchinson, 1995; New et al., 1999) to interpolate
station records under conditions of varying station density and/or
different topography has not been systematically evaluated. 

A growing number of climate scenarios require gridded daily
baseline  climatological  data  sets  at  continental  or  global  scales
yet, to  date, the  only  observed  data  products  that  meet  this
criterion  are  experimental  (e.g., Piper  and  Stewart, 1996;
Widmann  and  Bretherton, 2000).  For  this  and  other  reasons,
attempts have been made to combine monthly observed climatolo-
gies with stochastic weather generators to allow “synthetic” daily
observed baseline data to be generated for national (e.g., Carter et
al., 1996a; Semenov and Brooks, 1999), continental (e.g., Voet et
al., 1996; Kittel et al., 1997), or even global (e.g., Friend, 1998)
scales.  Weather  generators  are  statistical  models  of  observed
sequences of weather variables, whose outputs resemble weather
data at individual or multi-site locations (Wilks and Wilby, 1999).
Access to long observed daily weather series for many parts of the
world (e.g., oceans, polar regions and some developing countries)
is a problem for climate scenario developers who wish to calibrate
and use weather generators.

A number of statistical downscaling techniques (see Section
13.4 and Chapter 10, Section 10.6, for definition) used in scenario
development  employ  Numerical  Weather  Prediction  (NWP)
reanalysis  data  products  as  a  source  of  upper  air  climate  data
(Kalnay  et  al., 1996).  These  reanalysis  data  sets  extend  over
periods up to 40 years and provide spatial and temporal resolution
sometimes lacking in observed climate data sets. Relatively little
detailed  work  has  compared  such  reanalysis  data  with
independent  observed  data  sets  (see  Santer  et  al., 1999, and
Widmann  and  Bretherton, 2000, for  two  exceptions), but  it  is
known that certain reanalysis variables − such as precipitation and
some other hydrological variables − are unreliable.

13.3.3  Combining Baseline and Modelled Data

Climate scenarios based on model estimates of future climate can
be constructed either by adopting the direct model outputs or by
combining model estimates of the changed climate with observa-
tional  climate  data.  Impact  studies  rarely  use  GCM  outputs
directly  because  GCM  biases  are  too  great  and  because  the
spatial  resolution  is  generally  too  coarse  to  satisfy  the  data
requirements  for  estimating  impacts.  Mearns  et  al.  (1997)  and
Mavromatis and Jones (1999) provide two of the few examples
of  using  climate  model  output  directly  as  input  into  an  impact
assessment.

Model-based  estimates  of  climate  change  should  be
calculated  with  respect  to  the  chosen  baseline.  For  example, it
would be inappropriate to combine modelled changes in climate
calculated  with  respect  to  model  year  1990  with  an  observed
baseline  climate  representing  1951  to  1980.  Such  an  approach
would  “disregard” about  0.15°C  of  mean  global  warming
occurring between the mid-1970s and 1990. It would be equally
misleading to apply modelled changes in climate calculated with
respect  to  an  unforced  (control)  climate  representing  “pre-
industrial” conditions  (e.g., “forced” t3 minus  “unforced” t1 in
Figure 13.4) to an observed baseline climate representing some
period in the 20th century. Such an approach would introduce an
unwarranted amount of global climate change into the scenario.
This latter definition of modelled climate change was originally
used  in  transient  climate  change  experiments  to  overcome
problems associated with climate “drift” in the coupled AOGCM
simulations (Cubasch et al., 1992), but was not designed to be
used  in  conjunction  with  observed  climate  data.  It  is  more
appropriate to define the modelled change in climate with respect
to the same baseline period that the observed climate data set is
representing (e.g., “forced” t3 minus “forced” t1 in Figure 13.4,
added to a 1961 to 1990 baseline climate).

Whatever baseline period is selected, there are a number of
ways in which changes in climate can be calculated from model
results  and  applied  to  baseline  data.  For  example, changes  in

Climate Scenario Development

climate can be calculated either as the difference or as the ratio
between the simulated future climate and the simulated baseline
climate.  These  differences  or  ratios  are  then  applied  to  the
observed baseline climate – whether mean values, monthly or a
daily time-series. Differences are commonly applied to tempera-
ture  (as  in  Box  13.1), while  ratios  are  usually  used  with  those
surface  variables, such  as  precipitation, vapour  pressure  and
radiation, that are either positive or zero. Climate scenarios have
been  constructed  using  both  absolute  and  relative  changes  for
precipitation. The effects of the two different approaches on the
resulting climate change impacts depend on the types of impacts
being studied and the region of application. Some studies report
noticeable  differences  in  impacts  (e.g., Alcamo  et  al., 1998),
especially  since  applying  ratio  changes  alters  the  standard
deviation of the original series (Mearns et al., 1996); in others,
differences  in  impacts  were  negligible  (e.g., Torn  and  Fried,
1992). 

13.4  Scenarios with Enhanced Spatial and Temporal 

Resolution

The spatial and temporal scales of information from GCMs, from
which climate scenarios have generally been produced, have not
been ideal from an impacts point of view. The desire for informa-
tion on climate change regarding changes in variability as well as
changes in mean conditions and for information at high spatial
resolutions  has  been  consistent  over  a  number  of  years  (Smith
and Tirpak, 1989).

The  scale  at  which  information  can  appropriately  be  taken
from  relatively  coarse-scale  GCMs  has  also  been  debated.  For
example, many climate scenarios constructed from GCM outputs
have  taken  information  from  individual  GCM  grid  boxes,
whereas most climate modellers do not consider the outputs from
their simulation experiments to be valid on a single grid box scale
and  usually  examine  the  regional  results  from  GCMs  over  a
cluster  of  grid  boxes  (see  Chapter  10, Section  10.3). Thus, the
scale  of  information  taken  from  coarse  resolution  GCMs  for
scenario development often exceeds the reasonable resolution of
accuracy of the models themselves.

In  this  section  we  assess  methods  of  incorporating  high
resolution information into climate scenarios. The issue of spatial
and temporal scale embodies an important type of uncertainty in
climate scenario development (see Section 13.5.1.5).

Since spatial and temporal scales in atmospheric phenomena
are often related, approaches for increasing spatial resolution can
also  be  expected  to  improve  information  at  high-frequency
temporal scales (e.g., Mearns et al., 1997; Semenov and Barrow,
1997; Wang et al., 1999; see also Chapter 10). 

13.4.1  Spatial Scale of Scenarios

The climate change impacts community has long bemoaned the
inadequate  spatial  scale  of  climate  scenarios  produced  from
coarse  resolution  GCM  output  (Gates, 1985;  Lamb, 1987;
Robinson and Finkelstein, 1989; Smith and Tirpak, 1989; Cohen,
1990).  This  dissatisfaction  emanates  from  the  perceived
mismatch of scale between coarse resolution GCMs (hundreds of

kilometres) and the scale of interest for regional impacts (an order
or two orders of magnitude finer scale) (Hostetler, 1994; IPCC,
1994). For example, many mechanistic models used to simulate
the ecological effects of climate change operate at spatial resolu-
tions varying from a single plant to a few hectares. Their results
may be highly sensitive to fine-scale climate variations that may
be  embedded  in  coarse-scale  climate  variations, especially  in
regions of complex topography, along coastlines, and in regions
with highly heterogeneous land-surface covers.

Conventionally, regional “detail” in climate scenarios has been
incorporated by applying changes in climate from the coarse-scale
GCM  grid  points  to  observation  points  that  are  distributed  at
varying resolutions, but often at resolutions higher than that of the
GCMs (e.g., see Box 13.1; Whetton et al., 1996; Arnell, 1999).
Recently, high  resolution  gridded  baseline  climatologies  have
been developed with which coarse resolution GCM results have
been  combined  (e.g., Saarikko  and  Carter, 1996;  Kittel  et  al.,
1997).  Such  relatively  simple  techniques, however, cannot
overcome  the  limitations  imposed  by  the  fundamental  spatial
coarseness of the simulated climate change information itself.

Three  major  techniques  (referred  to  as  regionalisation
techniques)  have  been  developed  to  produce  higher  resolution
climate  scenarios: (1)  regional  climate  modelling  (Giorgi  and
Mearns, 1991; McGregor, 1997; Giorgi and Mearns, 1999); (2)
statistical downscaling (Wilby and Wigley, 1997; Murphy, 1999);
and  (3)  high  resolution  and  variable  resolution  Atmospheric
General  Circulation  Model  (AGCM)  time-slice  techniques
(Cubasch  et  al., 1995;  Fox-Rabinovitz  et  al., 1997).  The  two
former  methods  are  dependent  on  the  large-scale  circulation
variables  from  GCMs, and  their  value  as  a  viable  means  of
increasing  the  spatial  resolution  of  climate  change  information
thus  partially  depends  on  the  quality  of  the  GCM  simulations.
The  variable  resolution  and  high  resolution  time-slice  methods
use the AGCMs directly, run at high or variable resolutions. The
high resolution time-slice technique is also dependent on the sea
surface temperature simulated by a coarser resolution AOGCM.
There have been few completed experiments using these AGCM
techniques, which  essentially  are  still  under  development  (see
Chapter  10, Section  10.4).  Moreover, they  have  rarely  been
applied to explicit scenario formation for impacts purposes (see
Jendritzky  and  Tinz, 2000, for  an  exception)  and  are  not
discussed  further  in  this  chapter.  See  Chapter  10  for  further
details on all techniques.

13.4.1.1  Regional modelling
The basic strategy in regional modelling is to rely on the GCM to
reproduce the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere and for
the regional model to simulate sub-GCM scale regional distribu-
tions  or  patterns  of  climate, such  as  precipitation, temperature,
and winds, over the region of interest (Giorgi and Mearns, 1991;
McGregor, 1997; Giorgi and Mearns, 1999). The GCM provides
the initial and lateral boundary conditions for driving the regional
climate  model  (RCM).  In  general, the  spatial  resolution  of  the
regional model is on the order of tens of kiilometres, whereas the
GCM scale is an order of magnitude coarser. Further details on
the  techniques  of  regional  climate  modelling  are  covered  in
Chapter 10, Section 10.5. 

752

Climate Scenario Development

13.4.1.2  Statistical downscaling
In statistical downscaling, a cross-scale statistical relationship
is developed between large-scale variables of observed climate
such  as  spatially  averaged  500  hPa  heights, or  measure  of
vorticity, and local variables such as site-specific temperature
and precipitation (von Storch, 1995; Wilby and Wigley, 1997;
Murphy, 1999).  These  relationships  are  assumed  to  remain
constant in the climate change context. Also, it is assumed that
the  predictors  selected  (i.e., the  large-scale  variables)
adequately represent the climate change signal for the predic-
tand (e.g., local-scale precipitation). The statistical relationship
is  used  in  conjunction  with  the  change  in  the  large-scale
variables to determine the future local climate. Further details
of these techniques are provided in Chapter 10, Section 10.6. 

13.4.1.3  Applications of the methods to impacts
While  the  two  major  techniques  described  above  have  been
available  for  about  ten  years, and  proponents  claim  use  in
impact assessments as one of their important applications, it is
only  quite  recently  that  scenarios  developed  using  these
techniques  have  actually  been  applied  in  a  variety  of  impact
assessments, such  as  temperature  extremes  (Hennessy  et  al.,
1998; Mearns, 1999); water resources (Hassall and Associates,
1998; Hay et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1999; Wilby et al., 1999;
Stone  et  al., 2001);  agriculture  (Mearns  et  al., 1998, 1999,
2000a, 2001;  Brown  et  al., 2000)  and  forest  fires  (Wotton  et
al., 1998). Prior to the past couple of years, these techniques
were  mainly  used  in  pilot  studies  focused  on  increasing  the
temporal (and spatial) scale of scenarios (e.g., Mearns  et al.,
1997; Semenov and Barrow, 1997).

One  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  this  work  is
determining  whether  the  high  resolution  scenario  actually
leads  to  significantly  different  calculations  of  impacts
compared  to  that  of  the  coarser  resolution  GCM  from  which
the high resolution scenario was partially derived. This aspect
is related to the issue of uncertainty in climate scenarios (see
Section 13.5). We provide examples of such studies below. 

Application of high resolution scenarios produced from a
regional model (Giorgi et al., 1998) over the Central Plains of
the USA produced changes in simulated crop yields that were
significantly  different  from  those  changes  calculated  from  a
coarser resolution GCM scenario (Mearns et al., 1998; 1999,
2001). For simulated corn in Iowa, for example, the large-scale
(GCM) scenario resulted in a statistically significant decrease
in yield, but the high resolution scenario produced an insignif-
icant increase (Figure 13.5). Substantial differences in regional
economic  impacts  based  on  GCM  and  RCM  scenarios  were
also found in a recent integrated assessment of agriculture in
the  south-eastern  USA  (Mearns  et  al., 2000a,b).  Hay  et  al.
(1999), using  a  regression-based  statistical  downscaling
technique, developed  downscaled  scenarios  based  on  the
Hadley Centre Coupled AOGCM (HadCM2) transient runs and
applied them to a hydrologic model in three river basins in the
USA.  They  found  that  the  standard  scenario  from  the  GCM
produced  changes  in  surface  runoff  that  were  quite  different
from  those  produced  from  the  downscaled  scenario  (Figure
13.6).

13.4.2  Temporal Variability

The  climate  change  information  most  commonly  taken  from
climate  modelling  experiments  comprises  mean  monthly,
seasonal, or annual changes in variables of importance to impact
assessments. However, changes in climate will involve changes in
variability as well as mean conditions. As mentioned in Section
13.3  on  baseline  climate, the  interannual  variability  in  climate
scenarios  constructed  from  mean  changes  in  climate  is  most
commonly  inherited  from  the  baseline  climate, not  from  the
climate  change  experiment.  Yet, it  is  known  that  changes  in
variability could be very important to most areas of impact assess-
ment  (Mearns, 1995;  Semenov  and  Porter, 1995).  The  most
obvious way in which variability changes affect resource systems
is  through  the  effect  of  variability  change  on  the  frequency  of
extreme  events.  As  Katz  and  Brown  (1992)  demonstrated,
changes in standard deviation have a proportionately greater effect
than changes in means on changes in the frequency of extremes.
However, from a climate scenario point of view, it is the relative
size  of  the  change  in  the  mean  versus  standard  deviation  of  a
variable  that  determines  the  final  relative  contribution  of  these
statistical moments to a change in extremes. The construction of
scenarios incorporating extremes is discussed in Section 13.4.2.2.
The  conventional  method  of  constructing  mean  change
scenarios  for  precipitation  using  the  ratio  method  (discussed  in
Section 13.3) results in a change in variability of daily precipita-
tion intensity; that is, the variance of the intensity is changed by a
factor of the square of the ratio (Mearns et al., 1996). However, the
frequency  of  precipitation  is  not  changed.  Using  the  difference
method (as is common for temperature variables) the variance of
the  time-series  is  not  changed.  Hence, from  the  perspective  of
variability, application of the difference approach to precipitation
produces  a  more  straightforward  scenario.  However, it  can  also
result  in  negative  values  of  precipitation.  Essentially  neither
approach is realistic in its effect on the daily characteristics of the
time-series. As  mean  (monthly)  precipitation  changes, both  the
daily intensity and frequency are usually affected.

13.4.2.1  Incorporation of changes in variability: daily to 

interannual time-scales

Changes  in  variability  have  not  been  regularly  incorporated  in
climate scenarios because: (1) less faith has been placed in climate
model  simulations  of  changes  in  variability  than  of  changes  in
mean  climate;  (2)  techniques  for  changing  variability  are  more
complex than those for incorporating mean changes; and (3) there
may  have  been  a  perception  that  changes  in  means  are  more
important for impacts than changes in variability (Mearns, 1995).
Techniques for incorporating changes in variability emerged in the
early  1990s  (Mearns  et  al., 1992;  Wilks, 1992;  Woo, 1992;
Barrow and Semenov, 1995; Mearns, 1995).

Some relatively simple techniques have been used to incorpo-
rate changes in interannual variability alone into scenarios. Such
techniques  are  adequate  in  cases  where  the  impact  models  use
monthly  climate  data  for  input.  One  approach  is  to  calculate
present  day  and  future  year-by-year  anomalies  relative  to  the
modelled  baseline  period, and  to  apply  these  anomalies  (at  an
annual, seasonal  or  monthly  resolution)  to  the  long-term  mean

observed  baseline  climate.  This  produces  climate  time-series
having an interannual variability equivalent to that modelled for
the  present  day  and  future, both  superimposed  on  the  observed
baseline  climate.  The  approach  was  followed  in  evaluating
impacts of variability change on crop yields in Finland (Carter et
al., 2000a), and  in  the  formation  of  climate  scenarios  for  the
United States National Assessment, though in the latter case the
observed variability was retained for the historical period.

Another  approach  is  to  calculate  the  change  in  modelled
interannual  variability  between  the  baseline  and  future  periods,
and  then  to  apply  it  as  an  inflator  or  deflator  to  the  observed
baseline interannual variability. In this way, modelled changes in
interannual  variability  are  carried  forward  into  the  climate
scenario, but the observed baseline climate still provides the initial
definition of variability. This approach was initially developed in
Mearns et al. (1992) and has recently been experimented with by
Arnell  (1999).  However, this  approach  can  produce  unrealistic
features, such as negative precipitation or inaccurate autocorrela-
tion structure of temperature, when applied to climate data on a
daily time-scale (Mearns et al., 1996). 

The major, most complete technique for producing scenarios
with changes in interannual and daily variability involves manipu-
lation of the parameters of stochastic weather generators (defined
in Section 13.3.2). These are commonly based either on a Markov
chain approach (e.g., Richardson, 1981) or a spell length approach
(e.g., Racksko et al., 1991), and simulate changes in variability on
daily  to  interannual  time-scales  (Wilks, 1992).  More  detailed
information  on  weather  generators  is  provided  in  Chapter  10,
Section 10.6.2. 

To  bring  about  changes  in  variability, the  parameters  of  the
weather  generator  are  manipulated  in  ways  that  alter  the  daily
variance of the variable of concern (usually temperature or precip-
itation)  (Katz, 1996).  For  precipitation, this  usually  involves
changes in both the frequency and intensity of daily precipitation.
By manipulating the parameters on a daily time-scale, changes in

variability are also induced on the interannual time-scale (Wilks,
1992).  Some  weather  generators  operating  at  sub-daily  time-
scales have also been applied to climate scenario generation (e.g.,
Kilsby et al., 1998).

A number of crop model simulations have been performed to
determine the sensitivity of crop yields to incremental changes in
daily  and  interannual  variability  (Barrow  and  Semenov, 1995;
Mearns, 1995; Mearns et al., 1996; Riha et al., 1996; Wang and
Erda, 1996;  Vinocur  et  al., 2000).  In  most  of  these  studies,
changes in variability resulted in significant changes in crop yield.
For  example, Wang  and  Erda  (1996)  combined  systematic
incremental changes in daily variance of temperature and precipi-

tation  with  mean  climate  scenarios  in  their  study  of  climate
change and corn yields in China. They found that increases in the
variance  of  temperature  and  precipitation  combined, further
decreased crop yields compared to the effect of the mean change
scenarios alone taken from several GCMs. 

Studies  using  the  variance  changes  in  addition  to  mean
changes  from  climate  models  to  form  climate  scenarios  also
emerged in the past decade (Kaiser et al., 1993; Bates et al. 1994).
For  example, Bates  et  al.  (1994, 1996)  adapted  Wilks’ (1992)
method and applied it to changes in daily variability from doubled
CO2 runs  of  the  Commonwealth  Scientific  and  Industrial
Research Organisation (CSIRO) climate model (CSIRO9). They
then  applied  the  changed  time-series  to  a  hydrological  model.
Combined changes in mean and variability are also evident in a
broad  suite  of  statistical  downscaling  methods  (e.g., Katz  and
Parlange, 1996; Wilby et al., 1998). See also Chapter 10, Section
10.6.3, for  further  discussion  of  statistical  downscaling  and
changes in variability.

In  recent  years, more  robust  and  physically  meaningful
changes in climatic variability on daily to interannual time scales
have been found in runs of GCMs and RCMs for some regions
(e.g., Gregory  and  Mitchell, 1995;  Mearns  et  al., 1995a,b;
Whetton  et  al., 1998a;  Mearns, 1999;  Boer  et  al., 2000).  For
example, on both daily and interannual time-scales many models
simulate temperature variability decreases in winter and increases
in  summer  in  northern  mid-latitude  land  areas  (see  Chapter  9,
Section 9.3). This result is likely to encourage the further applica-
tion  of  model-derived  variability  changes  in  climate  scenario
construction.

The most useful studies, from the point of view of elucidating
uncertainty  in  climate  scenarios  and  impacts, are  those  that
compare applying scenarios with only mean changes to those with
mean  and  variability  change.  Semenov  and  Barrow  (1997)  and
Mearns et al. (1997) used mean and variance changes from climate
models, formed scenarios of climate change using weather genera-
tors and applied them to crop models. In both studies important
differences in the impacts of climatic change on crop yields were
calculated when including the effect of variance change, compared
to  only  considering  mean  changes.  They  identified  three  key
aspects of changed climate relevant to the role played by change in
daily to interannual variability of climate: the marginality of the
current climate for crop growth, the relative size of the mean and
variance changes, and the timing of these changes.

It  is  difficult  to  generalise  the  importance  of  changes  in
variability  to  climate  change  impacts  since  significance  of
changes  in  variability  is  region, variable, and  resource  system
specific. For example, based on results of equilibrium control and
2×CO2 experiments of DARLAM (a regional model developed in
Australia)  nested  within  the  CSIRO  climate  model  over  New
South Wales, Whetton et al. (1998a) emphasised that most of the
change  in  temperature  extremes  they  calculated  resulted  from
changes in the mean, not through change in the daily variance. In
contrast, Mearns  (1999)  found  large  changes  (e.g., decreases  in
winter)  in  daily  variance  of  temperature  in  control  and  2×CO2
experiments  with  a  regional  climate  model  (RegCM2)  over  the
Great Plains of the U.S. (Giorgi et al., 1998). These changes were
sufficient to make a significant difference in the frequency of daily

temperature  extremes.  Note, however, that  these  results  are  not
contradictory since they concern two very different regions. More
generalised statements may be made regarding the importance of
change  in  the  variability  of  precipitation  from  climate  change
experiments for determining changes in the frequency of droughts
and floods (e.g., Gregory et al., 1997; Kothavala, 1999). As noted
in Chapters 9 and 10, high intensity rainfall events are expected to
increase  in  general, and  precipitation  variability  would  be
expected to increase where mean precipitation increases.

Other types of variance changes, on an interannual time-scale,
based  on  changes  in  major  atmospheric  circulation  oscillations,
such as ENSO and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), are difficult
to  incorporate  into  impact  assessments.  The  importance  of  the
variability of climate associated with ENSO phases for resources
systems such as agriculture and water resources have been well
demonstrated (e.g., Cane et al., 1994; Chiew et al., 1998; Hansen
et al., 1998).

Where  ENSO  signals  are  strong, weather  generators  can  be
successfully  conditioned  on  ENSO  phases;  and  therein  lies  the
potential for creating scenarios with changes in the frequency of
ENSO  events.  By  conditioning  on  the  phases, either  discretely
(Wang  and  Connor, 1996)  or  continuously  (Woolhiser  et  al.,
1993), a model can be formed for incorporating changes in the
frequency  and  persistence  of  such  events, which  would  then
induce  changes  in  the  daily  (and  interannual)  variability  of  the
local  climate  sites. Weather  generators  can  also  be  successfully
conditioned using NAO signals (e.g., Wilby, 1998). However, it
must be noted that there remains much uncertainty in how events
such as ENSO might change with climate change (Knutson, et al.,
1997;  Timmerman  et  al., 1999;  Walsh  et  al., 1999;  see  also
Chapter  9, Section  9.3.5, for  further  discussion  on  possible
changes in ENSO events). While there is great potential for the use
of conditioned stochastic models in creating scenarios of changed
variability, to date, no such scenario has actually been applied to
an impact model. 

13.4.2.2  Other techniques for incorporating extremes into 

climate scenarios

While the changes in both the mean and higher order statistical
moments (e.g., variance) of time-series of climate variables affect
the  frequency  of  relatively  simple  extremes  (e.g., extreme  high
daily or monthly temperatures, damaging winds), changes in the
frequency of more complex extremes are based on changes in the
occurrence of complex atmospheric phenomena (e.g., hurricanes,
tornadoes, ice  storms).  Given  the  sensitivity  of  many  exposure
units to the frequency of extreme climatic events (see Chapter 3 of
TAR WG II, Table 3.10 (Carter and La Rovere, 2001)), it would
be desirable to incorporate into climate scenarios the frequency
and intensity of some composite atmospheric phenomena associ-
ated with impacts-relevant extremes.

More  complex  extremes  are  difficult  to  incorporate  into
scenarios for the following reasons: (1) high uncertainty on how
they may change (e.g., tropical cyclones); (2) the extremes may
not be represented directly in climate models (e.g., ice storms);
and (3) straightforward techniques of how to incorporate changes
at  a  particular  location  have  not  been  developed  (e.g., tropical
cyclone intensity at Cairns, Australia).

Climate Scenario Development

755

The  ability  of  climate  models  to  adequately  represent
extremes  partially  depends  on  their  spatial  resolution  (Skelly
and  Henderson-Sellers, 1996;  Osborn, 1997;  Mearns, 1999).
This is particularly true for complex atmospheric phenomena
such as hurricanes (see Chapter 10, Box 10.2). There is some
very limited information on possible changes in the frequency
and  intensity  of  tropical  cyclones  (Bengtsson  et  al., 1996;
Henderson-Sellers  et  al., 1998;  Krishnamurti  et  al., 1998;
Knutson  and  Tuleya, 1999;  Walsh  and  Ryan, 2000);  and  of
mid-latitude cyclones (Schubert et al., 1998), but these studies
are  far  from  definitive  (see  Chapter  9, Section  9.3.6, and
Chapter  10  for  discussion  on  changes  of  extremes  with
changes in climate). 

In  the  case  of  extremes  that  are  not  represented  at  all  in
climate models, secondary variables may sometimes be used to
derive  them.  For  example, freezing  rain, which  results  in  ice
storms, is not represented in climate models, but frequencies of
daily minimum temperatures on wet days might serve as useful
surrogate variables (Konrad, 1998). 

An  example  of  an  attempt  to  incorporate  such  complex
changes into climate scenarios is the study of McInnes et al.
(2000), who  developed  an  empirical/dynamical  model  that
gives  return  period  versus  height  for  tropical  cyclone-related
storm  surges  for  Cairns  on  the  north  Australian  coast.  To
determine  changes  in  the  characteristics  of  cyclone  intensity,
they prepared a climatology of tropical cyclones based on data
drawn  from  a  much  larger  area  than  Cairns  locally.  They
incorporated  the  effect  of  climate  change  by  modifying  the
parameters  of  the  Gumbel  distribution  of  cyclone  intensity
based on increases in tropical cyclone intensity derived from
climate model results over a broad region characteristic of the
location  in  question.  Estimates  of  sea  level  rise  also
contributed to the modelled changes in surge height. Other new
techniques  for  incorporating  such  complex  changes  into
quantitative climate scenarios are yet to be developed.

13.5  Representing Uncertainty in Climate Scenarios

13.5.1  Key Uncertainties in Climate Scenarios

Uncertainties  about  future  climate  arise  from  a  number  of
different  sources  (see  Figure  13.2)  and  are  discussed
extensively throughout this volume. Depending on the climate
scenario construction method, some of these uncertainties will
be  explicitly  represented  in  the  resulting  scenario(s), while
others will be ignored (Jones, 2000a). For example, scenarios
that rely on the results from GCM experiments alone may be
able  to  represent  some  of  the  uncertainties  that  relate  to  the
modelling of the climate response to a given radiative forcing,
but might not embrace uncertainties caused by the modelling of
atmospheric  composition  for  a  given  emissions  scenario, or
those related to future land-use change. Section 13.5.2 therefore
assesses different approaches for representing uncertainties in
climate  scenarios.  First, however, five  key  sources  of
uncertainty, as they relate to climate scenario construction, are
very  briefly  described.  Readers  are  referred  to  the  relevant
IPCC chapters for a comprehensive discussion.

13.5.1.1  Specifying alternative emissions futures
In  previous  IPCC  Assessments, a  small  number  of  future
greenhouse  gas  and  aerosol  precursor  emissions  scenarios  have
been  presented  (e.g., Leggett  et  al., 1992).  In  the  current
Assessment, a  larger  number  of  emissions  scenarios  have  been
constructed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)
(Nakic´enovic´  et  al., 2000), and  the  uncertain  nature  of  these
emissions  paths  have  been  well  documented  (Morita  and
Robinson, 2001). Climate scenarios constructed from equilibrium
GCM  experiments  alone  (e.g., Howe  and  Henderson-Sellers,
1997; Smith and Pitts, 1997) do not consider this uncertainty, but
some assumption about the driving emissions scenario is required
if  climate  scenarios  are  to  describe  the  climate  at  one  or  more
specified times in the future. This source of uncertainty is quite
often represented in climate scenarios (e.g., Section 13.5.2.1).

13.5.1.2  Uncertainties in converting emissions to concentrations
It  is  uncertain  how  a  given  emissions  path  converts  into
atmospheric concentrations of the various radiatively active gases
or aerosols. This is because of uncertainties in processes relating
to  the  carbon  cycle, to  atmospheric  trace  gas  chemistry  and  to
aerosol physics (see Chapters 3, 4 and 5). For these uncertainties
to  be  reflected  in  climate  scenarios  that  rely  solely  on  GCM
outputs, AOGCMs that explicitly simulate the various gas cycles
and  aerosol  physics  are  needed.  At  present, however, they  are
seldom, if ever, represented in climate scenarios.

13.5.1.3  Uncertainties in converting concentrations to radiative 

forcing

Even when presented with a given greenhouse gas concentration
scenario, there  are  considerable  uncertainties  in  the  radiative
forcing  changes, especially  aerosol  forcing, associated  with
changes  in  atmospheric  concentrations.  These  uncertainties  are
discussed in Chapters 5 and 6, but again usually remain unrep-
resented in climate scenarios.

13.5.1.4  Uncertainties in modelling the climate response to a 

given forcing

An  additional  set  of  modelling  uncertainties  is  introduced  into
climate scenarios through differences in the global and regional
climate responses simulated by different AOGCMs for the same
forcing. Different models have different climate sensitivities (see
Chapter  9, Section  9.3.4.1), and  this  remains  a  key  source  of
uncertainty  for  climate  scenario  construction. Also  important  is
the  fact  that  different  GCMs  yield  different  regional  climate
change patterns, even for similar magnitudes of global warming
(see Chapter 10). Furthermore, each AOGCM simulation includes
not only the response (i.e., the “signal”) to a specified forcing, but
also an unpredictable component (i.e., the “noise”) that is due to
internal climate variability. This latter may itself be an imperfect
replica of true climate variability (see Chapter 8). A fourth source
of uncertainty concerns important processes that are missing from
most  model  simulations.  For  instance  AOGCM-based  climate
scenarios do not usually allow for the effect on climate of future
land use and land cover change (which is itself, in part, climati-
cally  induced).  Although  the  first  two  sources  of  model
uncertainty − different climate sensitivities and regional climate

756

change patterns − are usually represented in climate scenarios, it
is less common for the third and fourth sources of uncertainty −
the  variable  signal-to-noise  ratio  and  incomplete  description  of
key processes and feedbacks − to be effectively treated.

1993; Parry et al., 1996; Risbey, 1998; Jones, 1999; Hulme and
Carter, 2000). The remainder of this section assesses four aspects
of climate scenario development that originate from this concern
about adequately representing uncertainty:

scenarios;

Most  climate  scenario  construction  methods  combine  model-
based  estimates  of  climate  change  with  observed  climate  data
(Section 13.3). Further uncertainties are therefore introduced into
a climate scenario because observed data sets seldom capture the
full range of natural decadal-scale climate variability, because of
errors in gridded regional or global baseline climate data sets, and
because  different  methods  are  used  to  combine  model  and
observed climate data. These uncertainties relating to the use of
observed  climate  data  are  usually  ignored  in  climate  scenarios.
Furthermore, regionalisation techniques that make use of informa-
tion from AOGCM and RCM experiments to enhance spatial and
temporal  scales  introduce  additional  uncertainties  into  regional
climate scenarios (their various advantages and diasdvantages are
assessed in Chapter 10 and in Section 13.4). These uncertainties
could  be  quantified  by  employing  a  range  of  regionalisation
techniques, but this is rarely done.

13.5.2  Approaches for Representing Uncertainties

There are different approaches for representing each of the above
five  generic  sources  of  uncertainty  when  constructing  climate
scenarios.  The  cascade  of  uncertainties, and  the  options  for
representing them at each of the five stages, can result in a wide
range  of  climate  outcomes  in  the  finally  constructed  scenarios
(Henderson-Sellers, 1996;  Wigley, 1999;  Visser  et  al., 2000).
Choices are most commonly made at the stage of modelling the
climate response to a given forcing, where it is common for a set
of climate scenarios to include results from different GCMs. In
practice, this sequential and conditional approach to representing
uncertainty in climate scenarios has at least one severe limitation:
at  each  stage  of  the  cascade, only  a  limited  number  of  the
conditional  outcomes  have  been  explicitly  modelled.  For
example, GCM  experiments  have  used  one, or  only  a  small
number, of  the  concentration  scenarios  that  are  plausible  (for
example, most  transient  AOGCM  experiments  that  have  been
used for climate scenarios adopted by impacts assessments have
been  forced  with  a  scenario  of  a  1%  per  annum  growth  in
greenhouse  gas  concentration).  Similarly, regionalisation
techniques have been used with only a small number of the GCM
experiments that have been conducted. These limitations restrict
the choices that can be made in climate scenario construction and
mean that climate scenarios do not fully represent the uncertain-
ties inherent in climate prediction.

In  order  to  overcome  some  of  these  limitations, a  range  of
techniques has been developed to allow more flexible treatment of
the entire cascade of uncertainty. These techniques manipulate or
combine different modelling results in a variety of ways. If we are
truly to assess the risk of climate change being dangerous, then
impact  and  adaptation  studies  need  scenarios  that  span  a  very
substantial part of the possible range of future climates (Pittock,

2. defining appropriate climate change signals;
3. risk assessment approaches;
4.  annotation  of  climate  scenarios  to  reflect  more  qualitative

aspects of uncertainty.

13.5.2.1  Scaling climate model response patterns
Pattern-scaling  methods  allow  a  wider  range  of  possible  future
forcings (e.g., the full range of IS92 (Leggett et al., 1992) or SRES
emissions scenarios) and climate sensitivities (e.g., the 1.5ºC to
4.5ºC IPCC range) to be represented in climate scenarios than if
only  the  direct  results  from  GCM  experiments  were  used.  The
approach involves normalising GCM response patterns according
to the global mean temperature change (although in some cases
zonal  mean  temperature  changes  have  been  used).  These
normalised patterns are then rescaled using a scalar derived from
simple  climate  models  and  representing  the  particular  scenario
under consideration.

This pattern-scaling method was first suggested by Santer et
al. (1990) and was employed in the IPCC First Assessment Report
to generate climate scenarios for the year 2030 (Mitchell et al.,
1990)  using  patterns  from  2×CO2 GCM  experiments.  It  has
subsequently been widely adopted in climate scenario generators
(CSGs), for  example  in  ESCAPE  (Rotmans  et  al., 1994),
IMAGE-2  (Alcamo  et  al., 1994), SCENGEN  (Hulme  et  al.,
1995a,b), SILMUSCEN  (Carter  et  al., 1995, 1996a), COSMIC
(Schlesinger et al., 1997) and CLIMPACTS (Kenny et al., 2000).
A  climate  scenario  generator  is  an  integrated  suite  of  simple
models  that  takes  emissions  or  forcing  scenarios  as  inputs  and
generates geographically distributed climate scenarios combining
response patterns of different greenhouse gases from GCMs with
observational  climate  data.  CSGs  allow  multiple  sources  of
uncertainty  to  be  easily  represented  in  the  calculated  scenarios,
usually by using pattern-scaling methods.

Two fundamental assumptions of pattern-scaling are, first, that
the defined GCM response patterns adequately depict the climate
“signal” under anthropogenic forcing (see Section 13.5.2.2) and,
second, that  these  response  patterns  are  representative  across  a
wide range of possible anthropogenic forcings. These assumptions
have been explored by Mitchell et al. (1999) who examined the
effect of scaling decadal, ensemble mean temperature and precip-
itation  patterns  in  the  suite  of  HadCM2  experiments. Although
their  response  patterns  were  defined  using  only  10-year  means,
using four-member ensemble means improved the performance of
the  technique  when  applied  to  reconstructing  climate  response
patterns in AOGCM experiments forced with alternative scenarios
(see Figure 13.7).  This confirmed earlier work by Oglesby and
Saltzman (1992), among others, who demonstrated that tempera-
ture response patterns derived from equilibrium GCMs were fairly
uniform over a wide range of concentrations, scaling linearly with
global  mean  temperature.  The  main  exception  occurred  in  the

Figure 13.7: Pattern correlations between the decadal ensemble mean
temperature (Northern Hemisphere only) from the HadCM2 experi-
ment forced with a 0.5%/yr increase in greenhouse gas concentrations
(Gd) and: the scaled ensemble mean pattern (solid line); the four
scaled individual ensemble member patterns – average coefficient
(dashed line); and the scaled ensemble mean pattern derived from the
HadCM2 experiment forced with a 1%/yr increase in greenhouse gas
concentrations (Ga) (dotted line). The correlations increase with time
as the pattern of greenhouse gas response (the “signal”) increasingly
dominates the random effects of internal climate variability (the
“noise”). The shaded area shows the spread of correlations between the
pairs of the individual members of the Gd ensemble; these correlations
are lower than those between the realised and scaled patterns above,
indicating that the scaled pattern is not due to internal climate
variability. (Source: Mitchell et al., 1999.)

regions  of  enhanced  response  near  sea  ice  and  snow  margins.
Mitchell et al. (1999) concluded that the uncertainties introduced
by  scaling  ensemble  decadal  mean  temperature  patterns  across
different  forcing  scenarios  are  smaller  than  those  due  to  the
model’s internal variability, although this conclusion may not hold
for variables with high spatial variability such as precipitation.

Two  situations  where  the  pattern-scaling  techniques  may
need more cautious application are in the cases of stabilisation
forcing scenarios and heterogenous aerosol forcing. Whetton et
al.  (1998b)  have  shown  that  for  parts  of  the  Southern
Hemisphere a highly non-linear regional rainfall response was
demonstrated in an AOGCM forced with a stabilisation scenario,
a  response  that  could  not  easily  be  handled  using  a  linear
pattern-scaling technique. In the case of heterogeneous forcing,
similar  global  mean  warmings  can  be  associated  with  quite
different  regional  patterns, depending  on  the  magnitude  and
pattern of the aerosol forcing. Pattern-scaling using single global
scalars is unlikely to work in such cases. There is some evidence,
however, to  suggest  that  separate  greenhouse  gas  and  aerosol
response patterns can be assumed to be additive (Ramaswamy
and Chen, 1997) and pattern-scaling methods have subsequently
been adapted by Schlesinger et al. (1997, 2000) for the case of
heterogeneously  forced  scenarios.  This  is  an  area, however,
where poor signal-to-noise ratios hamper the application of the
technique and caution is advised.

The  above  discussion  demonstrates  that  pattern-scaling
techniques provide a low cost alternative to expensive AOGCM
and RCM experiments for creating a range of climate scenarios
that embrace uncertainties relating to different emissions, concen-
tration  and  forcing  scenarios  and  to  different  climate  model
responses.  The  technique  almost  certainly  performs  best  in  the
case of surface air temperature and in cases where the response
pattern has been constructed so as to maximise the signal-to-noise
ratio. When climate scenarios are needed that include the effects
of  sulphate  aerosol  forcing, regionally  differentiated  response
patterns  and  scalars  must  be  defined  and  signal-to-noise  ratios
should be quantified. It must be remembered, however, that while
these techniques are a convenient way of handling several types of
uncertainty simultaneously, they introduce an uncertainty of their
own into climate scenarios that is difficult to quantify. Little work
has been done on exploring whether patterns of change in inter-
annual or inter-daily climate variability are amenable to scaling
methods.

13.5.2.2  Defining climate change signals
The  question  of  signal-to-noise  ratios  in  climate  model  simula-
tions  was  alluded  to  above, and  has  also  been  discussed  in
Chapters  9  and  12.  The  treatment  of  “signal” and  “noise” in
constructing  climate  scenarios  is  of  great  importance  in
interpreting  the  results  of  impact  assessments  that  make  use  of
these  scenarios.  If  climate  scenarios  contain  an  unspecified
combination of signal plus noise, then it is important to recognise
that the impact response to such scenarios will only partly be a
response to anthropogenic climate change; an unspecified part of
the  impact  response  will  be  related  to  natural  internal  climate
variability. However, if the objective is to specify the impacts of
the anthropogenic climate signal alone, then there are two possible
strategies for climate scenario construction:

• attempt to maximise the signal and minimise the noise;

• do not try to disentangle signal from noise, but supply impact
assessments  with  climate  scenarios  containing  both  elements
and also companion descriptions of future climate that contain
only noise, thus allowing impact assessors to generate their own
impact signal-to-noise ratios (Hulme et al., 1999a).

The  relative  strength  of  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  can  be
demonstrated in a number of ways. Where response patterns are
reasonably  stable  over  time, this  ratio  can  be  maximised  in  a
climate  change  scenario  by  using  long  (30-year  or  more)
averaging  periods.  Alternatively, regression  or  principal
component techniques may be used to extract the signal from the
model response (Hennessy et al., 1998). A third technique is to
use  results  from  multi-member  ensemble  simulations, as  first
performed by Cubasch et al. (1994). Sampling theory shows that
in such simulations the noise is reduced by a factor of √(n), where
n  is  the  ensemble  size.  Using  results  from  the  HadCM2  four-
member ensemble experiments, Giorgi and Francisco (2000), for
example, suggest  that  uncertainty  in  future  regional  climate
change  associated  with  internal  climate  variability  at  sub-
continental  scales  (107 km2), is  generally  smaller  than  the

uncertainty  associated  with  inter-model  or  forcing  differences.
This  conclusion  is  scale-  and  variable-dependent, however  (see
Chapter 9, Figure 9.4; see also Räisänen, 1999), and the inverse
may apply at the smaller scales (104 to 105 km2) at which many
impact  assessments  are  conducted.  Further  work  is  needed  on
resolving this issue for climate scenario construction purposes.

A different way of maximising the climate change signal is to
compare  the  responses  of  single  realisations  from  experiments
completed using different models. If the error for different models
is random with zero mean, then sampling theory shows that this
model average will yield a better estimate of the signal than any
single model realisation. This approach was first suggested in the
context  of  climate  scenarios  by  Santer  et  al.  (1990)  and  is
illustrated further in Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2. Treating different
GCM simulations in this way, i.e., as members of a multi-model
ensemble, is one way of defining a more robust climate change
signal, either for use in pattern-scaling techniques or directly in

constructing a climate scenario. The approach has been discussed
by Räisänen (1997) and used recently by Wigley (1999), Hulme
and Carter (2000; see Figure 13.8) and Carter  et al. (2000b) in
providing  regional  characterisations  of  the  SRES  emissions
scenarios. 

The  second  strategy  requires  that  the  noise  component  be
defined explicitly. This can be done by relying either on observed
climate  data  or  on  model-simulated  natural  climate  variability
(Hulme et al., 1999a; Carter et al., 2000b). Neither approach is
ideal. Observed climate data may often be of short duration and
therefore  yield  a  biased  estimate  of  the  noise.  Multi-decadal
internal  climate  variability  can  be  extracted  from  multi-century
unforced  climate  simulations  such  as  those  performed  by  a
number of modelling groups (e.g., Stouffer et al., 1994; Tett et al.,
1997; von Storch et al., 1997). In using AOGCM output in this
way, it is important not only to demonstrate that these unforced
simulations do not drift significantly (Osborn, 1996), but also to

Climate Scenario Development

evaluate  the  extent  to  which  model  estimates  of  low-frequency
variability  are  comparable  to  those  estimated  from  measured
climates  (Osborn  et  al., 2000)  or  reconstructed  palaeoclimates
(Jones et al., 1998). Furthermore, anthropogenic forcing may alter
the character of multi-decadal climate variability and therefore the
noise defined from model control simulations may not apply in
the future. 

13.5.2.3  Risk assessment approaches
Uncertainty  analysis  is  required  to  perform  quantitative  risk  or
decision  analysis  (see Toth  and  Mwandosya  (2001)  for  discus-
sion  of  decision  analysis).  By  itself, scenario  analysis  is  not
equivalent  to  uncertainty  analysis  because  not  all  possible
scenarios  are  necessarily  treated  and, especially, because
probabilities are not attached to each scenario (see Morgan and
Henrion (1990) for a general treatment of uncertainty analysis;
see Katz (2000) for a more recent overview focusing on climate
change). Recognising this limitation, a few recent studies (Jones,
2000b; New and Hulme, 2000) have attempted to modify climate
scenario  analysis, grouping  a  range  of  scenarios  together  and
attaching a probability to the resultant classes. Such an approach
can be viewed as a first step in bridging the gap between scenario
and uncertainty analysis. Single climate scenarios, by definition,
are limited to plausibility with no degree of likelihood attached.
Since risk analysis requires that probabilities be attached to each
climate  scenario, subjective  probabilities  can  be  applied  to  the
input  parameters  that  determine  the  climate  outcomes  (e.g.,
emissions  scenarios, the  climate  sensitivity, regional  climate
response patterns), thus allowing distributions of outcomes to be
formally quantified. 

In formal risk analysis, the extremes of the probability distri-
bution  should  encompass  the  full  range  of  possible  outcomes,
although in climate change studies this remains hard to achieve.
The ranges for global warming and sea level rise from the IPCC
WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR),
for  example, deliberately  did  not  encompass  the  full  range  of
possible outcomes and made no reference to probability distribu-
tions. As  a  consequence, the  bulk  of  impact  assessments  have
treated these IPCC ranges as having a uniform probability, i.e.,
acting as if no information is available about what changes are
more likely than others. As pointed out by Titus and Narayanan
(1996), Jones (1998, 2000a), and Parkinson and Young (1998),
however, where several sources of uncertainty are combined, the
resulting probability distribution is not uniform but is a function
of  the  component  probability  distributions  and  the  relationship
between the component elements. For example, descriptions of
regional  changes  in  temperature  and  rainfall  over  Australia
constructed from regional response patterns have been used in a
number  of  hydrological  studies  where  the  extreme  outcomes
have been considered as likely as outcomes in the centre of the
range (e.g., Chiew et al., 1995; Schreider et al., 1996; Whetton,
1998).  However, when  the  two  component  ranges  − global
warming and normalised local temperature and rainfall change −
are randomly sampled and then multiplied together, they offer a
distinctly  non-uniform  distribution  (see  Figure  13.9a).  Further
refinements  of  these  approaches  for  quantifying  the  risk  of
climate change are needed (New and Hulme, 2000).

Climate Scenario Development

This approach to portraying uncertainty has potentially useful
applications  when  combined  with  climate  impact  sensitivity
response surfaces (see Section 13.2.1; see also Chapter 3 of TAR
WG  II  (Carter  and  La  Rovere, 2001)).  The  superimposed
response  surfaces  allow  the  calculation  of  probabilities  for
exceeding  particular  impact  thresholds  (Figure  13.9b). Another
method  of  assessing  risk  using  quantified  probability  distribu-
tions is through a series of linked models such as those used for
calculating  sea  level  rise  (Titus  and  Narayanan, 1996)  and
economic  damage  due  to  sea  level  rise  (Yohe  and  Schlesinger,
1998), for quantifying climate uncertainty (Visser et al., 2000),
and in integrated assessments (Morgan and Dowlatabadi, 1996).
Efforts  to  make  explicit  probabilistic  forecasts  of  the  climate
response to a given emissions scenario for the near future have
been  made  using  the  current  observed  climate  trajectory  to
constrain the “forecasts” from several GCMs (Allen et al., 2000).
More details on this technique are given in Section 12.4.3.3.

13.5.2.4  Annotation of climate scenarios
Even  if  quantifiable  uncertainties  are  represented, further
uncertainties  in  climate  scenarios  may  still  need  to  be
documented  or  explicitly  treated.  These  include  the  possible
impact on scenarios of errors in the unforced model simulation,
the possibility that current models cannot adequately simulate the
enhanced greenhouse response of a climatic feature of interest, or
inconsistencies  between  results  of  model  simulations  and
emerging  observed  climatic  trends.  For  these  reasons  climate
scenarios are often annotated with a list of caveats, along with
some assessment as to their importance for the scenario user. 

When choosing which GCM(s) to use as the basis for climate
scenario construction, one of the criteria that has often been used
is the ability of the GCM to simulate present day climate. Many
climate scenarios have used this criterion to assist in their choice
of GCM, arguing that GCMs that simulate present climate more
faithfully  are  likely  to  simulate  more  plausible  future  climates
(e.g., Whetton and Pittock, 1991; Robock et al., 1993; Risbey and
Stone, 1996; Gyalistras et al., 1997; Smith and Pitts, 1997; Smith
and Hulme, 1998; Lal and Harasawa, 2000). A good simulation
of  present  day  climate, however, is  neither  a  necessary  nor  a
sufficient  condition  for  accurate  simulation  of  climate  change
(see Chapter 8). It is possible, for example, that a model with a
poor  simulation  of  present  day  climate  could  provide  a  more
accurate simulation of climate change than one which has a good
simulation of present climate, if it contains a better representation
of  the  dominant  feedback  processes  that  will  be  initiated  by
radiative  forcing.  While  such  uncertainties  are  difficult  to  test,
useful insights into the ability of models to simulate long-term
climate change can also be obtained by comparing model simula-
tions of the climate response to past changes in radiative forcing
against reconstructed paleoclimates.

This approach to GCM selection, however, raises a number of
questions. Over which geographic domain should the GCM be
evaluated – the global domain or only over the region of study?
Which climate variables should be evaluated – upper air synoptic
features  that  largely  control  the  surface  climate, or  only  those
climate variables, mostly surface, that are used in impact studies?
Recent AOGCMs simulate observed 1961 to 1990 mean climate

more faithfully than earlier GCMs (Kittel et al., 1998; see also
Chapter  8), but  they  still  show  large  errors  in  simulating  inter-
annual climate variability in some regions (Giorgi and Francisco,
2000; Lal et al., 2000) and in replicating ENSO-like behaviour in
the tropics (Knutson et al., 1997). These questions demonstrate
that there is no easy formula to apply when choosing GCMs for
climate  scenario  construction;  there  will  always  be  a  role  for
informed but, ultimately, individual judgement. This judgement,
however, should  be  made  not  just  on  empirical  grounds  (for
example, which  model’s  present  climate  correlates  best  with
observations) but also on the basis of understanding the reasons
for good or bad model performance, particularly if those reasons
are important for the particular scenario application.

Several examples of such annotations can be given. Lal and
Giorgi  (1997)  suggested  that  GCMs  that  cannot  simulate  the
observed interannual variability of the Indian monsoon correctly
should not be used as the basis for climate scenarios. Giorgi et al.
(1998) commented that model-simulated spring temperatures over
the USA Central Plains were too cold in both the CSIRO GCM
and  in  the  CSIRO-driven  RegCM2  control  simulations  and
affected  the  credibility  of  the  ensuing  temperature  climate
scenarios.  Finally, scenarios  prepared  for  the  Australian  region
have  often  been  accompanied  by  the  note  that  ENSO  is  an
important component of Australian climate that may change in the
future, but that is not yet adequately simulated in climate models
(e.g., Hennessy et al., 1998). Expert judgment can also be used to
place confidence estimates on scenario ranges (Morgan and Keith,
1995). For example, Jones et al. (2000) placed “high confidence”
on  the  temperature  scenarios  (incorporating  quantifiable
uncertainty) prepared for the South Pacific, but only “moderate to
low confidence” in the corresponding rainfall scenarios.

13.6 Consistency of Scenario Components

This  section  discusses  some  of  the  caveats  of  climate  scenario
development  and  focuses  on  the  need  for  consistency  in
representing different physical aspects of the climate system. It
does not discuss the many possible inconsistencies with respect
to socio-economic issues in scenario development. Chapter 3 of
the TAR WG II (Carter and La Rovere, 2001) and Chapter 2 of
the TAR WG III (Morita and Robinson, 2001) provide a detailed
treatment  of  these  issues.  Three  common  inconsistencies  in
applying  climate  scenarios  are  discussed, concerning  the
representation of ambient versus equivalent CO2 concentrations,
biosphere-ocean-atmosphere interactions and time lags between
sea level rise and temperature change. 

The  climate  system  consists  of  several  components  that
interact with and influence each other at many different temporal
and spatial scales (see Chapter 7). This complexity adds further
constraints to the development of climate scenarios, though their
relevance is strongly dependent on the objectives and scope of the
studies that require scenarios. Most climate scenarios are based
on readily available climate variables (e.g., from AOGCMs) and,
where  these  are  used  in  impact  assessments, studies  are  often
restricted to an analysis of the effects of changes in climate alone.
However, other related environmental aspects may also change,
and these are often neglected or inadequately represented, thus

potentially reducing the comprehensiveness of the impact assess-
ment.  Furthermore, some  feedback  processes  that  are  seldom
considered  in  AOGCM  simulations, may  modify  regional
changes in climate (e.g., the effect of climate-induced shifts in
vegetation on albedo and surface roughness).

Concurrent  changes  in  atmospheric  concentrations  of  gases
such  as  CO2, sulphur  dioxide  (SO2)  and  ozone  (O3)  can  have
important effects on biological systems. Studies of the response of
biotic  systems  require  climate  scenarios  that  include  consistent
information on future levels of these species. For example, most
published  AOGCM  simulations  have  used  CO2-equivalent
concentrations  to  represent  the  combined  effect  of  the  various
gases. Typically, only  an  annual  1%  increase  in  CO2-equivalent
concentrations, which approximates changes in radiative forcing
of  the  IS92a  emission  scenario  (Leggett  et  al., 1992), has  been
used. However, between 10 and 40% of this increase results from
non-CO2 greenhouse gases (Alcamo et al., 1995). The assumption
that  CO2 concentrations  equal  CO2-equivalent  concentrations
(e.g., Schimel  et  al., 1997;  Walker  et  al., 1999)  has  led  to  an
exaggeration of direct CO2 effects. If impacts are to be assessed
more  consistently, proper  CO2 concentration  levels  and  CO2-
equivalent  climate  forcing  must  be  used.  Many  recent  impact
assessments  that  recognise  these  important  requirements  (e.g.,
Leemans et al., 1998; Prinn et al., 1999; Downing et al., 2000)
make  use  of  tools  such  as  scenario  generators  (see  Section
13.5.2.1) that explicitly treat atmospheric trace gas concentrations.
Moreover, some  recent  AOGCM  simulations  now  discriminate
between the individual forcings of different greenhouse gases (see
Chapter 9, Table 9.1)

The biosphere is an important control in defining changes in
greenhouse gas concentrations. Its surface characteristics, such as
albedo and surface roughness, further influence climate patterns.
Biospheric  processes, such  as  CO2-sequestration  and  release,
evapotranspiration and land-cover change, are in turn affected by
climate. For example, warming is expected to result in a poleward
expansion  of  forests  (IPCC, 1996b).  This  would  increase
biospheric  carbon  storage, which  lowers  future  CO2 concentra-
tions and change the surface albedo which would directly affect
climate.  A  detailed  discussion  of  the  role  of  the  biosphere  on
climate can be found elsewhere (Chapters 3 and 7), but there is a
clear need for an improved treatment of biospheric responses in
scenarios that are designed for regional impact assessment. Some
integrated  assessment  models, which  include  simplifications  of
many key biospheric responses, are beginning to provide consis-
tent  information  of  this  kind  (e.g., Alcamo  et  al., 1996, 1998;
Harvey et al., 1997; Xiao et al., 1997; Goudriaan et al., 1999).

Another important input to impact assessments is sea level rise.
AOGCMs usually calculate the thermal expansion of the oceans
directly, but  this  is  only  one  component  of  sea  level  rise  (see
Chapter  11).  Complete  calculations  of  sea  level  rise, including
changes  in  the  mass  balance  of  ice  sheets  and  glaciers, can  be
made  with  simpler  models  (e.g., Raper  et  al., 1996), and  the
transient dynamics of sea level rise should be explicitly calculated
because the responses are delayed (Warrick et al., 1996). However,
the  current  decoupling  of  important  dynamic  processes  in  most
simple  models  could  generate  undesirable  inaccuracies  in  the
resulting scenarios.

Climate  scenario  generators  can  comprehensively  address
some of these inconsistencies. Full consistency, however, can only
be attained through the use of fully coupled global models (earth
system models) that systematically account for all major processes
and their interactions, but these are still under development.

Executive Summary

Further work is required to improve the ability to detect, attribute,
and  understand  climate  change, to  reduce  uncertainties, and  to
project future climate changes. In particular, there is a need for
additional  systematic  observations, modelling  and  process
studies.  A  serious  concern  is  the  decline  of  observational
networks. Further work is needed in eight broad areas:

• Reverse the decline of observational networks in many parts of
the world. Unless networks are significantly improved, it may
be difficult or impossible to detect climate change over large
parts of the globe.

• Sustain  and  expand  the  observational  foundation  for  climate
studies  by  providing  accurate, long-term, consistent  data
including  implementation  of  a  strategy  for  integrated  global
observations. Given the complexity of the climate system and
the inherent multi-decadal time-scale, there is a need for long-
term  consistent  data  to  support  climate  and  environmental
change  investigations  and  projections.  Data  from  the  present
and recent past, climate-relevant data for the last few centuries,
and  for  the  last  several  millennia  are  all  needed.  There  is  a
particular  shortage  of  data  in  polar  regions  and  data  for  the
quantitative assessment of extremes on the global scale.

• Understand  better  the  mechanisms  and  factors  leading  to
changes in radiative forcing; in particular, improve the observa-
tions  of  the  spatial  distribution  of  greenhouse  gases  and
aerosols. It  is  particularly  important  that  improvements  are
realised in deriving concentrations from emissions of gases and
particularly aerosols, and in addressing biogeochemical seques-
tration and cycling, and specifically, in determining the spatial-
temporal distribution of carbon dioxide  (CO2) sources and sinks,
currently and in the future. Observations are needed that would
decisively  improve  our  ability  to  model  the  carbon  cycle;  in
addition, a  dense  and  well-calibrated  network  of  stations  for
monitoring  CO2 and  oxygen  (O2)  concentrations  will  also  be
required  for  international  verification  of  carbon  sinks.
Improvements in deriving concentrations from emissions of gases
and in the prediction and assessment of direct and indirect aerosol
forcing will require an integrated effort involving in situ observa-
tions, satellite remote sensing, field campaigns and modelling.

• Understand  and  characterise  the  important  unresolved
processes and feedbacks, both physical and biogeochemical,
in  the  climate  system.  Increased  understanding  is  needed  to
improve  prognostic  capabilities  generally.  The  interplay  of
observation  and  models  will  be  the  key  for  progress.    The
rapid  forcing  of  a  non-linear  system  has  a  high  prospect  of
producing surprises.

• Address  more  completely  patterns  of  long-term  climate
variability  including  the  occurrence  of  extreme  events.  This
topic  arises  both  in  model  calculations  and  in  the  climate
system. In simulations, the issue of climate drift within model
calculations  needs  to  be  clarified  better  in  part  because  it

771

compounds the difficulty of distinguishing signal and noise.
With respect to the long-term natural variability in the climate
system  per  se, it  is  important  to  understand  this  variability
and to expand the emerging capability of predicting patterns
of organised variability such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO). This predictive capability is both a valuable test of
model  performance  and  a  useful  contribution  in  natural
resource and economic management.

• Improve methods to quantify uncertainties of climate projec-
tions and scenarios, including development and exploration
of  long-term  ensemble  simulations  using  complex  models.
The  climate  system  is  a  coupled  non-linear  chaotic  system,
and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states
is not possible. Rather the focus must be upon the prediction
of the probability distribution of the system’s future possible
states  by  the  generation  of  ensembles  of  model  solutions.
Addressing  adequately  the  statistical  nature  of  climate  is
computationally intensive and requires the application of new
methods of model diagnosis, but such statistical information
is essential. 

• Improve  the  integrated  hierarchy  of  global  and  regional
climate  models  with  a  focus  on  the  simulation  of  climate
variability, regional  climate  changes, and  extreme  events.
There is the potential for increased understanding of extremes
events by employing regional climate models; however, there
are also challenges in realising this potential. It will require
improvements in the understanding of the coupling between
the major atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial systems, and
extensive diagnostic modelling and observational studies that
evaluate and improve simulation performance. A particularly
important issue is the adequacy of data needed to attack the
question of changes in extreme events.

•  Link models of the physical climate and the biogeochemical
system  more  effectively, and  in  turn  improve  coupling  with
descriptions  of  human  activities.  At  present, human
influences  generally  are  treated  only  through  emission
scenarios that provide external forcings to the climate system.
In future more comprehensive models, human activities need
to begin to interact with the dynamics of physical, chemical,
and  biological  sub-systems  through  a  diverse  set  of
contributing activities, feedbacks, and responses.

Cutting  across  these  foci  are  crucial  needs  associated  with
strengthening  international  co-operation  and  co-ordination  in
order  to  utilise  better  scientific, computational, and  observa-
tional resources. This should also promote the free exchange of
data among scientists. A special need is to increase the observa-
tional and research capacities in many regions, particularly in
developing countries. Finally, as is the goal of this assessment,
there  is  a  continuing  imperative  to  communicate  research
advances in terms that are relevant to decision making.

The challenges to understanding the Earth system, including
the  human  component, are  daunting, but  these  challenges
simply must be met.

14.1 Introduction

There has been encouraging progress over this first decade of the
IPCC  process.  We  understand  better  the  coupling  of  the
atmosphere and ocean. Significant steps have been taken in linking
the atmosphere and the terrestrial systems although the focus tends
to  be  on  water-energy  and  the  biosphere  with  fixed  vegetation
patterns.  Even  so, revealing  and  unexpected  teleconnections  are
being  discovered;  moreover, progress  is  being  made  towards
model structures and data sets that will allow implementation of
coupled  atmosphere-ocean-terrestrial  models  that  include  key
biological-biogeochemical feedbacks. There is also encouraging
progress in developing integrated assessment models that couple
economic activity, with associated emissions and impacts, with
models of the biogeochemical and climate systems. This work
has yielded preliminary insights into system behaviour and key
policy-relevant uncertainties.

The  challenges  are  significant, but  the  record  of  progress
suggests  that  within  the  next  decade  the  scientific  community
will develop fully coupled dynamical (prognostic) models of the
full  Earth  system  (e.g., the  coupled  physical  climate, biogeo-
chemical, human sub-systems) that can be employed on multi-
decadal  time-scales  and  at  spatial  scales  relevant  to  strategic
impact  assessment.  Future  models  should  certainly  advance  in
completeness  and  sophistication;  however, the  key  will  be  to
demonstrate some degree of prognostic skill. The strategy will be
to  couple  the  biogeochemical-physical  climate  system  to
representations of key aspects of the human system, and then to
develop more coherent scenarios of human actions in the context
of feedbacks from the biogeochemical-physical climate system.
Developing these coupled models is an important step. From
the perspective of understanding the Earth system, determining
the nature of the link between the biogeochemical system and the
physical climate system represents a fundamental scientific goal.
Present understanding is incomplete, and a successful attack will
require  extensive  interdisciplinary  collaboration.  It  will  also
require global data that clearly document the state of the system
and how that state is changing as well as observations to illumi-
nate important processes more clearly.

14.2 The Climate System

14.2.1 Overview

Models  of  physical  processes  in  the  ocean  and  atmosphere
provide  much  of  our  current  understanding  of  future  climate
change.  They  incorporate  the  contributions  of  atmospheric
dynamics and thermodynamics through the methods of computa-
tional fluid dynamics. This approach was initially developed in
the 1950s to provide an objective numerical approach to weather
prediction. It is sometimes forgotten that the early development
of “supercomputers” at that time was motivated in large part by
the need to solve this problem. In the 1960s, versions of these
weather prediction models were developed to study the “general
circulation” of  the  atmosphere, i.e., the  physical  statistics  of
weather systems satisfying requirements of conservation of mass,
momentum, and  energy.  To  obtain  realistic  simulations, it  was

Advancing Our Understanding

found necessary to include additional energy sources and sinks:
in  particular, energy  exchanges  with  the  surface  and  moist
atmospheric processes with the attendant latent heat release and
radiative heat inputs. 

Development  of  models  for  the  general  circulation  of  the
ocean started later, but has proceeded in a similar manner. Models
that deal with the physics of the oceans have been developed and
linked to models of the atmospheric system. Within ocean models,
the  inclusion  of  geochemical  and  biological  interactions  has
begun, with a focus upon the carbon cycle. Since the late 1960s,
the geochemical aspects of the carbon cycle have been included in
low-dimensional box models. More recently, including the carbon
chemistry system in general circulation models has simply been a
question of allocation of computing resources. Modelling of the
biological system, however, has been more challenging, and it has
only  been  recently  that  primitive  ecosystem  models  have  been
incorporated  in  global  general  circulation  ocean  models.  Even
though progress has been significant, much remains to be done.
Eddy-resolving ocean models with chemistry and biology need to
be  tested  and  validated  in  a  transient  mode, and  the  prognostic
aspects of marine ecosystems including nutrient dynamics need
greater attention at basin and global scales.

Model development for the ocean and atmosphere has had a
fundamental  theoretical  advantage: it  is  based  on  firmly
established  hydrodynamic  equations.  At  present  there  is  less
theoretical  basis  for  a  “first  principles” development  of  the
dynamical behaviour of the terrestrial system. There is a need to
develop a fundamental methodology to describe this very hetero-
geneous and complex system. For the moment, it is necessary to
rely  heavily  upon  parametrizations  and  empirical  relationships.
Such reliance is data intensive and hence independent validation
of  terrestrial  system  models  is  problematical.  In  spite  of  these
difficulties, a  co-ordinated  strategy  has  been  developed  to
improve estimates of terrestrial primary productivity and respira-
tion by means of measurement and modelling. The strategy has
begun to yield dividends. Techniques from statistical mechanics
have been wedded to biogeochemistry and population ecology,
yielding  new  vegetation  dynamic  models.  Global  terrestrial
models at meso-spatial scales (roughly 50 km grids) now exist
which  capture  complex  ecophysiological  processes  and
ecosystem dynamics. 

Expanded  efforts  are  needed  in  these  domain-specific
models. In the ocean, we need to consider better the controls on
thermohaline  circulation, on  potential  changes  in  biological
productivity, and on the overall stability of the ocean circulation
system.  Within  terrestrial  systems  the  question  of  the  carbon
sink-source pattern is central: what is it and how might it change?
Connected  to  this  question  is  the  continued  development  of
dynamic  vegetation  models, which  treat  competitive  processes
within  terrestrial  ecosystems  and  their  response  to  multiple
stresses. And for the atmosphere, a central question has been, is,
and likely will be the role of clouds. Also, there is a correspon-
ding non-linearity associated with change in the distribution and
extent  of  sea  ice.  Further  increased  efforts  will  be  needed  in
linking terrestrial ecosystems with the atmosphere, the land with
the ocean, the ocean (and its ecosystems) with the atmosphere,
the  chemistry  of  the  atmosphere  with  the  physics  of  the

Advancing Our Understanding

773

atmosphere, and  finally  linking  the  human  system  to  them  all.
Such  models  will  also  need  to  be  able  to  highlight  different
regions with increased spatial and temporal detail.

Models, however, depend upon high quality data. Data allow
hypotheses about processes and their linkages to be rejected or to
be  given  increased  consideration.  Giving  formal  (e.g., quantita-
tive)  expression  to  processes  is  at  the  heart  of  the  scientific
enterprise. Such expressions reflect our knowledge and form the
basis  for  models.  Models  are  simply  formal  expressions  of
processes  and  how  they  fit  together.  And  all  rest  upon  data.
Models  are  of  limited  use  without  observations;  the  value  of
observations  increases  by  interaction  with  models.  Systematic
global observations are an essential underpinning of research to
improve  understanding  of  the  climate  system.  For  numerous
applications  in  climate-impact  research, information  about  the
complex  nature  of  the  system  is  needed.  Unfortunately, there
continue  to  be  justifiable  concerns  about  the  loss  of  some
monitoring of climate parameters and deterioration of coverage.
There is a basic need for more observations with better coverage,
higher accuracy, and with increased availability. This overriding
importance of data has been recognised repeatedly in the past and
in this volume (e.g., Chapter 2, Section 2.8; Chapter 3, Section
3.5; Chapter 4, Section 4.2; Chapter 6, Section 6.14; Chapter 11,
Section  11.6.1  and  Chapter  12, Section  12.4), and  there  are
reasons for guarded optimism on the issue of data even though
there are also significant reasons for concern. One such reason for
tempered optimism is the plan for and beginning implementation
of global observing systems such as the Global Climate Observing
System (GCOS), Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and
Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS). However plans in
themselves do not produce data, and data that are not accessible
are of limited value. The issue of data remains central for progress.

14.2.2 Predictability in a Chaotic System

The climate system is particularly challenging since it is known that
components  in  the  system  are  inherently  chaotic;  there  are
feedbacks that could potentially switch sign, and there are central
processes  that  affect  the  system  in  a  complicated, non-linear
manner.  These  complex, chaotic, non-linear  dynamics  are  an
inherent aspect of the climate system. As the IPCC WGI Second
Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) has previously
noted, “future unexpected, large and rapid climate system changes
(as have occurred in the past) are, by their nature, difficult to predict.
This  implies  that  future  climate  changes  may  also  involve
‘surprises’.  In  particular, these  arise  from  the  non-linear, chaotic
nature of the climate system … Progress can be made by investi-
gating  non-linear  processes  and  sub-components  of  the  climatic
system.” These  thoughts  are  expanded  upon  in  this  report:
“Reducing uncertainty in climate projections also requires a better
understanding  of  these  non-linear  processes  which  give  rise  to
thresholds  that  are  present  in  the  climate  system.  Observations,
palaeoclimatic data, and models suggest that such thresholds exist
and  that  transitions  have  occurred  in  the  past  …  Comprehensive
climate  models  in  conjunction  with  sustained  observational
systems, both in situ and remote, are the only tool to decide whether
the evolving climate system is approaching such thresholds. Our

knowledge  about  the  processes, and  feedback  mechanisms
determining  them, must  be  significantly  improved  in  order  to
extract early signs of such changes from model simulations and
observations.” (See Chapter 7, Section 7.7).

14.2.2.1 Initialisation and flux adjustments
Integrations of models over long time-spans are prone to error as
small  discrepancies  from  reality  compound.  Models, by  defini-
tion, are reduced descriptions of reality and hence incomplete and
with error. Missing pieces and small errors can pose difficulties
when  models  of  sub-systems  such  as  the  ocean  and  the
atmosphere are coupled. As noted in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2, at
the  time  of  the  SAR  most  coupled  models  had  difficulty  in
reproducing a stable climate with current atmospheric concentra-
tions  of  greenhouse  gases, and  therefore  non-physical  “flux
adjustment terms” were added. In the past few years significant
progress has been achieved, but difficulties posed by the problem
of  flux  adjustment, while  reduced, remain  problematic  and
continued  investigations  are  needed  to  reach  the  objective  of
avoiding dependence on flux adjustment (see Chapter 8, Section
8.4.2; see also Section 8.5.1.1).

Another important (and related) challenge is the initialisation
of the models so that the entire system is in balance, i.e., in statis-
tical  equilibrium  with  respect  to  the  fluxes  of  heat, water, and
momentum between the various components of the system. The
problem  of  determining  appropriate  initial  conditions  in  which
fluxes  are  dynamically  and  thermodynamically  balanced
throughout a coupled stiff system, such as the ocean-atmosphere
system, is  particularly  difficult  because  of  the  wide  range  of
adjustment times ranging from days to thousands of years. This
can  lead  to  a  “climate  drift”, making  interpretation  of  transient
climate calculations difficult (see Chapter 8, Section 8.4.1).

The  initialisation  of  coupled  models  is  important  because  it
produces  the  climate  base  state  or  “starting  point” for  climate
change experiments. Climate model initialisation continues to be
an  area  of  active  research  and  refinement  of  techniques    (see
Chapter 8, Section 8.4). Most groups use long integrations of the
sub-component models to provide a dynamically and thermody-
namically balanced initial state for the coupled model integration.
However, there  are  at  least  as  many  different  methods  used  to
initialise  coupled  models  as  there  are  modelling  groups.  See
Stouffer and Dixon (1998) for a more complete discussion of the
various issues and methods used to initialise coupled models. 

Since the SAR, improvements in developing better initialisa-
tion  techniques  for  coupled  models  have  been  realised.  For
instance, starting  with  observed  oceanic  conditions  has  yielded
improved simulations with reduced climate drift (Gordon et al.,
1999).  Earlier  attempts  with  this  technique  usually  resulted  in
relatively  large  trends  in  the  surface  variables  (Meehl  and
Washington, 1995; Washington  and  Meehl, 1996).  Successfully
starting long coupled integrations from observations is important
for a number of reasons: it simplifies the initialisation procedure,
saves time and effort, and reduces the overhead for starting new
coupled model integrations.

Such progress is important, but again further work is needed.
We simply do not fully understand the causes of climate drift in
coupled models (see Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2).

Advancing Our Understanding

14.2.2.2 Balancing the need for finer scales and the need for 

ensembles

There  is  a  natural  tendency  to  produce  models  at  finer  spatial
scales  that  include  both  a  wider  array  of  processes  and  more
refined descriptions. Higher resolution can lead to better simula-
tions  of  atmospheric  dynamics  and  hydrology  (Chapter  8,
Section 8.9.1), less diffusive oceanic simulations, and improved
representation  of  topography.  In  the  atmosphere, fine-scale
topography  is  particularly  important  for  resolving  small-scale
precipitation patterns (see Chapter 8, Section 8.9.1). In the ocean,
bottom  topography  is  very  important  for  the  various  boundary
flows (see Chapter 7, Section 7.3.4). The use of higher oceanic
resolution  also  improves  the  simulation  of  internal  variability
such as ENSO (see Chapter 8, Section 8.7.1). However, in spite
of the use of higher resolution, important climatic processes are
still not resolved by the model’s grid, necessitating the continued
use of sub-grid scale parametrizations. 

It  is  anticipated  that  the  grids  used  in  the  ocean  sub-
components of the coupled climate models will begin to resolve
eddies by the next report. As the oceanic eddies become resolved
by the grid, the need for large diffusion coefficients and various
mixing schemes should be reduced (see Chapter 8, Section 8.9.3;
see also, however, the discussion in Section 8.9.2). In addition,
the  amount  of  diapycnal  mixing, which  is  used  for  numerical
stability in this class of ocean models, will also be reduced as the
grid  spacing  becomes  smaller.  This  reduction  in  the  sub-grid
scale  oceanic  mixing  should  reduce  the  uncertainty  associated
with the mixing schemes and coefficients currently being used.

Underlying  this  issue  of  scale  and  detail  is  an  important
tension. As the spatial and process detail in a model is increased,
the  required  computing  resources  increase, often  significantly;
models with less detail may miss important non-linear dynamics
and  feedbacks  that  affect  model  results  significantly, and  yet
simpler  models  may  be  more  appropriate  to  generating  the
needed statistics. The issue of spatial detail is intertwined with
the  representation  of  the  physical  (and  other)  processes, and
hence the need for a balance between level of process detail and
spatial  detail.  These  tensions  must  be  recognised  forthrightly,
and  strategies  must  be  devised  to  use  the  available  computing
resources  wisely.  Analyses  to  determine  the  benefits  of  finer
scale and increased resolution need to be carefully considered.
These  considerations  must  also  recognise  that  the  potential
predictive capability will be unavoidably statistical, and hence it
must  be  produced  with  statistically  relevant  information.  This
implies that a variety of integrations (and models) must be used
to  produce  an  ensemble  of  climate  states.  Climate  states  are
defined in terms of averages and statistical quantities applying
over a period typically of decades (see Chapter 7, Section 7.1.3
and Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2).

Fortunately, many groups have performed ensemble integra-
tions, that  is, multiple  integrations  with  a  single  model  using
identical  radiative  forcing  scenarios  but  different  initial
conditions.  Ensemble  integrations  yield  estimates  of  the
variability  of  the  response  for  a  given  model.  They  are  also
useful in determining to what extent the initial conditions affect
the magnitude and pattern of the response. Furthermore, many
groups  have  now  performed  model  integrations  using  similar

radiative forcings. This allows ensembles of model results to be
constructed  (see  Chapter  9, Section  9.3;  see  also  the  end  of
Chapter  7, Section  7.1.3  for  an  interesting  question  about
ensemble formation).

In sum, a strategy must recognise what is possible. In climate
research and modelling, we should recognise that we are dealing
with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the
long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible. The
most we can expect to achieve is the prediction of the probability
distribution of the system’s future possible states by the genera-
tion  of  ensembles  of  model  solutions.  This  reduces  climate
change to the discernment of significant differences in the statis-
tics of such ensembles. The generation of such model ensembles
will  require  the  dedication  of  greatly  increased  computer
resources  and  the  application  of  new  methods  of  model
diagnosis. Addressing adequately the statistical nature of climate
is  computationally  intensive, but  such  statistical  information  is
essential.

14.2.2.3 Extreme events
Extreme  events  are, almost  by  definition, of  particular
importance  to  human  society.  Consequently, the  importance  of
understanding  potential  extreme  events  is  first  order.  The
evidence  is  mixed, and  data  continue  to  be  lacking  to  make
conclusive  cases.  Chapter  9, Sections  9.3.5  and  9.3.6  consider
projections of changes in patterns of variability (discussed in the
next section) and changes in extreme events (see also Chapters 2
and  10).  Though  the  conclusions  are  mixed  in  both  of  these
topical areas, certain results begin to appear robust. There appear
to be some consistent patterns with increased CO2 with respect to
changes in variability: (a) the Pacific climate base state could be
a more El Niño-like state and (b) an enhanced variability in the
daily precipitation in the Asian summer monsoon with increased
precipitation intensity (Chapter 9, Section 9.3.5). More generally,
the intensification of the hydrological cycle with increased CO2
is a robust conclusion. For possible changes in extreme weather
and climate events, the most robust conclusions appear to be: (a)
an  increased  probability  of  extreme  warm  days  and  decreased
probability of extreme cold days and (b) an increased chance of
drought for mid-continental areas during summer with increasing
CO2 (see Chapter 9, Section 9.3.6). 

The  evaluation  of  many  types  of  extreme  events  is  made
difficult because of issues of scale. Damaging extreme events are
often at small temporal and spatial scales. Intense, short-duration
events  are  not  well-represented  (or  not  represented  at  all)  in
model-simulated  climates.  In  addition, there  is  often  a  basic
mismatch between the scales resolved in models and those of the
validating  data.  A  promising  approach  is  to  use  multi-fractal
models of rainfall events in that they naturally generate extreme
events. Reanalysis has also helped in this regard, but reanalysis
per  se is  not  the  sole  answer  because  the  models  used  for
reanalysis  rely  on  sub-grid  scale  parametrizations  almost  as
heavily as climate models do. 

One area that is possibly ripe for a direct attack on improving
the modelling of extreme events is tropical cyclones (see Section
Chapter 2, 2.7.3.1; Chapter 8, Section 8.8.4; Chapter 9, Section
9.3.6.4, and Chapter 10, Box 10.2). Also, there is the potential for

Advancing Our Understanding

775

increased  understanding  of  extreme  events  by  employing
regional  climate  models  (RCMs);  however, there  are  also
challenges to realising this potential (see Chapter 10). It must be
established  that  RCMs  produce  more  realistic  extremes  than
general circulation models (GCMs). Most RCM simulations to
date  are  not  long  enough  (typically  5  or  10  years  for  nested
climate  change  simulations)  to  evaluate  extremes  well  (see
Chapter 10, Section 10.5.2). 

Another  area  in  which  developments  are  needed  is  that  of
extremes  associated  with  the  land  surface  (flood  and  drought).
There is still a mismatch between the scale of climate models and
the finer scales appropriate for surface hydrology. This is partic-
ularly problematical for impact studies. For droughts there is a
basic  issue  of  predictability;  drought  prediction  is  difficult
regardless of scale.

A particularly important issue is the adequacy of data needed
to attack the question of changes in extreme events. There have
been  recent  advances  in  our  understanding  of  extremes  in
simulated  climates  (see, for  example, Meehl  et  al., 2000), but
thus far the approach has not been very systematic. Atmospheric
Model Intercomparison Project 2 (AMIP2) provides an opportu-
nity for a more systematic approach: AMIP2 will be collecting
and organising some of the high-frequency data that are needed
to study extremes. However, it must be recognised that we are
still unfortunately short of data for the quantitative assessment of
extremes on the global scale in the observed climate.

Finally, it is often stated that the impacts of climate change
will be felt through changes in extremes because they stress our
present  day  adaptations  to  climate  variability.  What  does  this
imply for the research agenda for the human dimension side of
climate studies?

14.2.2.4 Organised variability
An overriding challenge to modelling and to the IPCC is predic-
tion.  This  challenge  is  particularly  acute  when  predictive
capability is sought for a system that is chaotic, that has signifi-
cant  non-linearities, and  that  is  inherently  stiff  (i.e., widely
varying time constants). And within prognostic investigations of
such  a  complex  system, the  issue  of  predicting  extreme  events
presents a particularly vexing yet important problem. However,
there  appear  to  be  coherent  modes  of  behaviour  that  not  only
support a sense of optimism in attacking the prediction problem,
but also these modes may offer measurable prediction targets that
can be used as benchmarks for evaluating our understanding of
the  climate  system.  In  addition, predictions  of  these  modes
represent valuable contributions in themselves.

Evaluating the prognostic skill of a model and understanding
the characteristics of this skill are clearly important objectives. In
the  case  of  weather  prediction, one  can  estimate  the  range  of
predictability by evaluating the change of the system from groups
of  initial  states  that  are  close  to  each  other. The  differences  in
these time-evolving states give a measure of the predictive utility
of  the  model.  In  addition, one  has  the  near-term  reality  of  the
evolving  weather  as  a  constant  source  of  performance  metrics.
For the climate issue, the question of predictability is wrapped up
with  understanding  the  physics  behind  the  low-frequency
variability  of  climate  and  distinguishing  the  signal  of  climate

change (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2.1). In other words, there are
the  paired  challenges  of  capturing  (predicting)  “natural”
variability of climate as well as the emerging anthropogenically
forced climate signal. This dual challenge is distinctively climatic
in  nature, and  whereas  the  longer-term  character  of  climate
projections is unavoidable and problematic, the intra-seasonal to
inter-decadal  modes  of  climate  variability  (e.g., ENSO, Pacific
Decadal  Oscillation  (PDO), and  North  Atlantic  Oscillation
(NAO) – see also Chapter 7, Box 7.2) offer opportunities to test
prognostic  climate  skill.  Here, some  predictive  skill  for  the
climate  system  appears  to  exist  on  longer  time-scales.  One
example  is  the  ocean-atmosphere  phenomenon  of  ENSO.  This
skill has been advanced and more clearly demonstrated since the
SAR, and  this  progress  and  demonstration  are  important  (see
Chapter  7, Section  7.6;  Chapter  8, Section  8.7  and  Chapter  9,
Section  9.3.5).  Such  demonstrations  and  the  insights  gained  in
developing and making prognostic statements on climate modes
frame an important area for further work.

This opportunity is well summarised in Chapter 8 (in partic-
ular, Section 8.7), “The atmosphere-ocean coupled system shows
various  modes  of  variability  that  range  widely  from  intra-
seasonal  to  inter-decadal  time-scales  (see  Chapters  2  and  7).
Since  the  SAR, considerable  progress  has  been  achieved  in
characterising  the  decadal  to  inter-decadal  variability  of  the
ocean-atmosphere system. Successful evaluation of models over
a wide range of phenomena increases our confidence.”

14.2.3 Key Sub-systems and Phenomena in the Physical-

Climate System

Central  to  the  climate  system  are  the  coupled  dynamics  of  the
atmosphere-ocean-terrestrial  system, the  physical  processes
associated with the energy and water cycles and the associated
biological  and  chemical  processes  controlling  the  biogeochem-
ical  cycles, particularly  carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur,
iron, and  silicon.  The  atmosphere  plays  a  unique  role  in  the
climate system since on a zeroth order basis it sets the radiative
forcing.  Specific  sub-systems  that  are  important  and  yet  still
poorly understood are clouds and sea ice; the thermohaline ocean
circulation is a fundamentally important phenomenon that needs
to  be  known  better, and  underlying  these  sub-systems  and
phenomena  are  the  still  ill-understood  non-linear  processes  of
advection  (large-scale)  and  convection  (small-scale)  of
dynamical  and  thermodynamical  oceanic  and  atmospheric
quantities.  These  sub-systems, phenomena, and  processes  are
important  and  merit  increased  attention  to  improve  prognostic
capabilities generally.

14.2.3.1 Clouds
The role of clouds in the climate system continues to challenge
the  modelling  of  climate  (e.g., Chapter  7, Section  7.2.2).  It  is
generally accepted that the net effect of clouds on the radiative
balance of the planet is negative and has an average magnitude of
about  10  to  20  Wm−2.  This  balance  consists  of  a  short-wave
cooling (the albedo effect) of about 40 to 50 Wm−2 and a long-
wave warming of about 30 Wm−2. Unfortunately, the size of the
uncertainties  in  this  budget  is  large  when  compared  to  the

776

Advancing Our Understanding

expected anthropogenic greenhouse forcing. Although we know
that  the  overall  net  effect  of  clouds  on  the  radiative  balance  is
slightly negative, we do not know the sign of cloud feedback with
respect to the increase of greenhouse gases, and it may vary with
the region. In fact, the basic issue of the nature of the future cloud
feedback  is  not  clear.  Will  it  remain  negative?  If  the  planet
warms, then it is plausible that evaporation will increase, which
probably implies that liquid water content will increase but the
volume of clouds may not. What will be the effect and how will
the effects be distributed in time and space? Finally, the issue of
cloud  feedbacks  is  also  coupled  to  the  very  difficult  issue  of
indirect aerosol forcing (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3).

The importance of clouds was summarised in the SAR: “The
single largest uncertainty in determining the climate sensitivity to
either  natural  or  anthropogenic  changes  are  clouds  and  their
effects  on  radiation  and  their  role  in  the  hydrological  cycle”
(Kattenberg  et  al., 1996, p.345).  And  yet, the  single  greatest
source of uncertainty in the estimates of the climate sensitivity
continues to be clouds (see also Chapter 7, Section 7.2). Since the
SAR, there have been a number of improvements in the simula-
tion of both the cloud distribution and in the radiative properties
of  clouds  (Chapter  7, Section  7.2.2).  The  simulation  of  cloud
distribution  has  improved  as  the  overall  simulation  of  the
atmospheric  models  has  improved.  In  addition, the  cloud  sub-
component  models  used  in  the  coupled  models  have  become
more realistic. Also, our understanding of the radiative properties
of clouds and their effects on climate sensitivity have improved.
And yet in Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2 we find that, “In spite of these
improvements, there  has  been  no  apparent  narrowing  of  the
uncertainty  range  associated  with  cloud  feedbacks  in  current
climate change simulations.”

Handling the physics and/or the parametrization of clouds in
climate models remains a central difficulty. There is a need for
increased observations. J. Mitchell highlighted the challenge in a
recent paper at the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)
Workshop on Cloud Properties and Cloud Feedbacks in Large-
scale Models where he stated that “Reducing the uncertainty in
cloud-climate feedbacks is one of the toughest challenges facing
atmospheric physicists” (Mitchell, 2000).

Cloud  modelling  is  a  particularly  challenging  scientific
problem because it involves processes covering a very wide range
of space- and time-scales. For example, cloud systems extending
over  thousands  of  kilometres  to  cloud  droplets  and  aerosols  of
microscopic  size  are  all  important  components  of  the  climate
system. The time-scales of interest can range from hundreds of
years (e.g., future equilibrium climates) to fractions of a second
(e.g., droplet collisions). This is not to say that all cloud micro-
physics must be included in modelling cloud formation and cloud
properties, but the demarcation between what must be included
and  what  can  be  parametrized  remains  unclear.  Clarifying  this
demarcation and improving both the resulting phenomenological
characterisations and parametrizations will depend critically on
improved global observations of clouds (see Chapter 2, Section
2.5.5;  see  also  Senior, 1999).  Of  particular  importance  are
observations  of  cloud  structure  and  distribution  against  natural
patterns of climate variability (e.g., ENSO). Complementing the
broad climatologies will be important observations of cloud ice-

water  and  liquid-water  content, radiative  heating  and  optical
depth profiles, and precipitation occurrence and cloud geometry.
The  recently  approved  CloudSat  and  PICASSO  missions,
which  will  fly  in  formation  with  the  National Aeronautics  and
Space Administration (USA) (NASA) Earth Observing System
(EOS) PM (the Aqua Mission), will provide valuable profiles of
cloud  ice  and  liquid  content, optical  depth, cloud  type, and
aerosol  properties.  These  observations, combined  with  wider
swath radiometric data from EOS PM sensors, will provide a rich
new  source  of  information  about  the  properties  of  clouds
(Stephens et al., 2000).

And yet, this question of cloud feedback remains open, and it
is  not  clear  how  it  will  be  answered.    Given  that  the  current
generation of global climate models represents the Earth in terms
of  grid-points  spaced  roughly  200  km  apart, many  features
observed on smaller scales, such as individual cloud systems and
cloud geometry, are not explicitly resolved. Without question, the
strategy for attacking the feedback question will involve compar-
ison  of  model  simulations  with  appropriate  observations  on
global or local scales. The interplay of observation and models,
again, will  be  the  key  for  progress.  Mitchell  (Mitchell, 2000)
states this clearly, “Unless there are stronger links between those
making observations and those using climate models, then there
is little chance of a reduction in the uncertainty in cloud feedback
in  the  next  twenty  years.” This  is  echoed  in  this  report  (see
Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2), “A straightforward approach of model
validation is not sufficient to constrain efficiently the models and
a more dedicated approach is needed. It should be favoured by a
larger availability of satellite measurements.”

14.2.3.2 Thermohaline circulation
In  the  oceanic  component  of  climate  models, ocean  current
patterns are represented significantly better in models of higher
resolution in large part because ocean current systems (including
mesoscale  eddies), ocean  variability  (including  ENSO  events),
and  the  thermohaline  circulation  (and  other  vertical  mixing
processes)  and  topography  which  greatly  influence  the  ocean
circulation, can  be  better  represented.  Improved  resolution  and
understanding  of  the  important  facets  of  coupling  in  both
atmosphere and ocean components of global climate models have
also been proven to reduce flux imbalance problems arising in the
coupling  of  the  oceanic  and  the  atmospheric  components.
However, it must still be noted that uncertainties associated with
clouds still cause problems in the computation of surface fluxes.
With the availability of computer power, a central impediment to
the gain in model accuracy is being reduced; however, there is
still a long way to go before many of the important processes are
explicitly  resolved  by  the  numerical  grid.  In  addition  there
continues to be a necessary “concomitant” increase in resources
for  process  studies  and  for  diagnosis  as  computer  power
increases. It must still be remembered that the system presents
chaotic  characteristics  that  can  only  be  evaluated  through  an
analysis  of  ensembles  statistics, and  these  ensembles  must  be
generated  by  running  suites  of  models  under  varied  initial  and
forcing conditions. 

In  a  few  model  calculations, a  large  rate  of  increase  in  the
radiative  forcing  of  the  planet  is  enough  to  cause  the  ocean’s

Advancing Our Understanding

777

global  thermohaline  circulation  almost  to  disappear, though  in
some experiments it reappears given sufficiently long integration
times (see Chapter 7, Section 7.3.7 and Chapter 9, 9.3.4.3). This
circulation  is  important  because  in  the  present  climate  it  is
responsible  for  a  large  portion  of  the  heat  transport  from  the
tropics to higher latitudes, and it plays an important role in the
oceanic  uptake  of  CO2.  Palaeo-oceanographic  investigations
suggest that aspects of longer-term climate change are associated
with  changes  in  the  ocean’s  thermohaline  circulation. We  need
appropriate observations of the thermohaline circulation, and its
natural  variations, to  compare  with  model  simulations  (see
Chapter 9, Section 9.3.4.3; see also Chapter 7, Section 7.6 and
Chapter 8, Section 8.5.2.2).

The coming decade will be important for ocean circulation in
the context of climate. A particularly exciting development is the
potential for assimilating synoptic ocean observations (e.g., the
US/French  ocean  TOPography  satellite  altimeter  EXperiment
(TOPEX-POSEIDON) and Argo) into ocean general circulation
models. Key questions, such as how well do the ocean models
capture the inferred heat flux or tracer distributions, are central to
the  use  of  these  models  in  climate  studies.  The  effort  of
comparing  models  with  data, as  the  direct  path  for  model
rejection  and  model  improvement, is  central  to  increasing  our
understanding of the system.

14.2.3.3 Arctic sea ice
There is increasing evidence that there is a decline in the extent
and thickness of Arctic sea ice in the summer that appears to be
connected with the observed recent Arctic warming (see Chapter
2, Section  2.2.5.2;  Chapter  7, Box  7.1, and  Chapter  8, Section
8.5.3; see also Chapter 7, Section 7.5.2 for a general discussion
on  the  role  of  sea  ice  in  the  climate  system  as  well  as  recent
advances in modelling sea ice). 

It is not known whether these changes reflect anthropogenic
warming transmitted either from the atmosphere or the ocean or
whether  they  mostly  reflect  a  major  mode  of  multi-decadal
variability.  Some of this pattern of warming has been attributed
to  recent  trends  in  the  Arctic  Oscillation  (see  Section  2.6);
however, how  the  anthropogenic  signal  is  imprinted  on  the
natural patterns of climate variability remains a central question.
What  does  seem  clear  is  that  the  changes  in Arctic  sea  ice  are
significant, and  there  is  a  positive  feedback  that  could  be
triggered  by  declines  in  sea-ice  extent  through  changes  in  the
planetary  albedo.  If  the  Arctic  shifted  from  being  a  bright
summer object to a less bright summer object, then this would be
an  important  positive  feedback  on  a  warming  pattern  (see  the
“left loop” in Chapter 7, Figure 7.6). 

In  addition  to  these  recently  available  observations, there
have  been  several  models  (Commonwealth  Scientific  and
Industrial Research Organisation (Australia) (CSIRO) – Gordon
and  O’Farrell, 1997;  Department  of  Energy  (USA)  Parallel
Climate Model (DOE PCM) – Washington et al., 2000; National
Center for Atmospheric Research (USA) Climate System Model
(NCAR  CSM)  –  Weatherly  et  al., 1998;  see  also  Chapter  7,
Section 7.5.2 and Chapter 8, Section 8.5.3) that have improved
their sea ice representation since the SAR. These improvements
include simulation of open water within the ice pack, snow cover

upon the ice, and sea ice dynamics. The incorporation of sophis-
ticated  sea  ice  components  in  climate  models  provides  a
framework for testing and calibrating these models with observa-
tions. Further, as the formulation of sea ice dynamics becomes
more  realistic, the  validity  of  spatial  patterns  of  the  simulated
wind  stress  over  the  polar  oceans  is  becoming  an  issue  in
Atmosphere-Ocean  General  Circulation  Model  (AOGCM)
simulations. Hence, improvements, such as the above-mentioned
data, in  the  observational  database  will  become  increasingly
relevant  to  climate  model  development.  In  addition, satellite
observations  have  recently  been  used  to  determine  sea-ice
velocity (Emery et al., 1997) and melt season (Smith, 1998). 

New field programmes are under way with the explicit goal
of improving the accuracy of model simulations of sea ice and
polar climate (see Randall et al., 1998, for a review). In order to
improve model representations and validation, it will be essential
to  enhance  the  observations  over  the  Arctic  including  ocean,
atmosphere, and  sea  ice  state  variables. This  will  help  provide
more reliable projections for a region of the world where signifi-
cant changes are expected. 

The  refinement  of  sea-ice  models  along  with  enhanced
observations  reduces  the  uncertainty  associated  with  ice
processes.  (See  Chapter  7, Section  7.5  and  Chapter  8, Section
8.5.3 for more discussion and evaluation of model performance;
for some open issues see Chapter 9, Section 9.4.)  This progress
is  important, and  efforts  are  needed  to  expand  upon  it  and, as
stated, to improve the observational basis significantly. 

14.2.4 The Global Carbon Cycle

From measurements of air trapped in ice cores and from direct
measurements of the atmosphere, we know that in the past 200
years the abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by
over  30%  (i.e., from  a  concentration  of  280  ppm  by  volume
(pppmv) in 1700 to nearly 370 ppmv in 2000). We also know that
the  concentration  was  relatively  constant  (roughly  within  ±10
ppmv  of  275)  for  more  than  1,000  years  prior  to  the  human-
induced  rapid  increase  in  atmospheric  CO2 (see  Chapter  3,
Figures 3.2a and 3.2b). 

Looking  further  back  in  time, we  find  an  extraordinarily
regular record of change. The Vostok core (Figure 3.2d) captures
a  remarkable  and  intriguing  signal  of  the  periodicity  of  inter-
glacial  and  glacial  climate  periods  in  step  with  the  transfer  of
significant pools of carbon from the land (most likely through the
atmosphere)  to  the  ocean  and  then  the  recovery  of  terrestrial
carbon back from the ocean. The repeated pattern of a 100 to 120
ppmv decline in atmospheric CO2 from an inter-glacial value of
280 to 300 ppmv to a 180 ppmv floor and then the rapid recovery
as the planet exits glaciation suggests a tightly governed control
system. There is a similar methane (CH4) cycle between 320 to
350  ppbv  (parts  per  billion  by  volume)  and  650  to  770  ppbv.
What begs explanation is not just the linked periodicity of carbon
and  glaciation, but  also  the  apparent  consistent  limits  on  the
cycles over the period. See Chapter 3, Box 3.4.

Today’s  atmosphere, imprinted  with  the  fossil  fuel  CO2
signal, stands at nearly 90 to 70 ppmv above the previous inter-
glacial maximum of 280 to 300 ppmv. The current methane value

778

Advancing Our Understanding

is even further (percentage-wise) from its previous inter-glacial
high values. In essence, carbon has been moved from a relatively
immobile pool (in fossil fuel reserves) in the slow carbon cycle to
the  relatively  mobile  pool  (the  atmosphere)  in  the  fast  carbon
cycle, and the ocean, terrestrial vegetation and soils have yet to
equilibrate with this “rapidly” changing concentration of CO2 in
the atmosphere.

Given this remarkable and unprecedented history one cannot
help but wonder about the characteristics of the carbon cycle in
the  future  (Chapter  3).  To  understand  better  the  global  carbon
cycle, two themes are clear: (1) there is a need for global observa-
tions that can contribute significantly to determining the sources
and sinks of carbon and (2) there is a need for fundamental work
on  critical  biological  processes  and  their  interaction  with  the
physical system. Two observational needs must be highlighted:

•  Observations  that  would  decisively  improve  our  ability  to
model the  carbon  cycle.  For  example, a  dense  and  well-
calibrated network for monitoring CO2 and O2 concentrations
that will also be required for international verification of carbon
sources and sinks is central.

•  “Benchmarks” data  sets  that  allow  model  intercomparison
activities  to  move  in  the  direction  of  becoming  data-model
comparisons and not just model-model comparisons.

We  note  that  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and
Technological  Advice  (SBSTA)  of  the  United  Nations
Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)
recognised  the  importance  of  an  Integrated  Global  Observing
Strategy  Partnership  in  developing  observing  systems  for  the
oceans  and  terrestrial  carbon  sources  and  sinks  in  the  global
carbon cycle and in promoting systematic observations.

There  is  also  a  range  of  areas  where  present  day  biogeo-
chemistry modelling is not only in need of additional data, but is
also crucially limited by insufficient understanding at the level of
physical or biological processes. Clarifying these processes and
their  controls  is  central  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  global
carbon cycle.

14.2.4.1 The marine carbon system
The  marine  carbon  cycle  plays  an  important  role  in  the
partitioning  of  CO2 between  the  atmosphere  and  the  ocean
(Chapter 3, Section 3.2.3). The primary controls are the circula-
tion  of  the  ocean  (a  function  of  the  climate  system), and  two
important  biogeochemical  processes: the  solubility  pump  and
the biological pump, both of which act to create a global mean
increase of dissolved inorganic carbon with depth.

The physical circulation and the interplay of the circulation
and the biogeochemical processes are central to understanding
the  ocean  carbon  system  and  future  concentrations  of  CO2 in
the  atmosphere.  In  the  ocean, the  prevailing  focus  on  surface
conditions and heat transport has led to a comparative neglect
of  transport  processes  below  about  800  m  depth.  For  carbon
cycle  modelling, however, vertical  transports  and  deep
horizontal  transports  assume  fundamental  importance.  The
importance  of  the  thermohaline  circulation  is  obviously

important  (and  insufficiently  well  understood;  see  Section
14.2.3.2) in moving carbon from the surface to deeper layers.
Similarly, the regional distribution of upwelling, which brings
carbon-  and  nutrient-rich  water  to  surface  layers, is  poorly
known and inconsistently simulated in models. The ventilation
of the Southern Ocean provides an extreme, though not unique,
example. 

It has been pointed out by a number of modelling studies that
if there were no marine biological system, then the pre-industrial
atmospheric  CO2 concentration  would  have  been  450  ppmv
instead  of  280  ppmv  (Sarmiento  and  Toggweiler  1984;  Maier-
Raimer et al., 1996). Any complete model of the natural ocean
carbon  cycle  should  therefore  include  the  biological  system;
however, most recent assessments of the oceanic uptake of anthro-
pogenic CO2 have assumed that the biological system would not
be affected by climate change and have therefore only modelled
the chemical solubility in addition to the physical circulation. This
was based on the understanding that nitrate or other nutrients limit
marine phytoplankton growth. There would therefore be no CO2
fertilisation effect as has been suggested for terrestrial plants and
that, unless there was a large change in the nutrient supply to the
upper ocean because of a climate-induced shift in circulation, then
no  extra  anthropogenic  CO2 could  be  sequestered  to  the  deep
ocean by the organic matter pump. More recently, a number of
studies have suggested possible ways in which the organic matter
pump might be affected by climate change over a 200-year time-
scale  (see  Chapter  3, Sections  3.2.3.2  and  3.2.3.3).  The  main
conclusion  was  that, because  of  the  complexity  of  biological
systems, it was not yet possible to say whether some of the likely
feedbacks would be positive or negative. However, it is clear that
our understanding of these issues needs to be improved.

Simulating  the  calcium  carbonate  system  with  a  process-
oriented  model  presents  another  level  of  complexity  beyond
simulating  the  organic  matter  formation-decomposition: the
distribution  of  particular  phytoplankton  species  (mainly  cocco-
lithophorids)  must  be  simulated. The  calcium  carbonate  pump,
however, contributes  relatively  little  to  the  vertical  dissolved
inorganic carbon (DIC) gradient compared to the organic matter
and solubility pumps. The importance of this pump needs careful
evaluation and its past (palaeo) role in the carbon cycle needs to
be considered (see end of Chapter 3, Section 3.2.3.3).

In  the  ocean, models  incorporating  biology  are  relatively
underdeveloped and incorporate empirical assumptions (such as
fixed Redfield (nutrient) ratios) rather than explicitly modelling
the  underlying  processes.  As  a  result, present  models  may  be
unduly constrained in the range of responses they can show to
changes in climate and ocean dynamics.  A better understanding
is  required  concerning  the  workings  of  nutrient  constraints  on
productivity, the controls of nitrogen fixation, and the controls on
the  geographical  distribution  of  biogeochemically  important
species  and  functional  types  in  the  ocean.  To  develop  this
understanding it will be necessary to combine remotely sensed
information  with  a  greatly  expanded  network  of  continuous
biogeochemical monitoring sites, and to gather data on the space-
time  patterns  of  variability  in  species  composition  of  marine
ecosystems in relation to climate variability phenomena such as
ENSO and NAO. (See Chapter 3, Sections 3.6.3 and 3.7).

14.2.4.2 The terrestrial system 
The metabolic processes that are responsible for plant growth and
maintenance and the microbial turnover, which is associated with
dead organic matter decomposition, control the cycle of carbon,
nutrients, and  water  through  plants  and  soil  on  both  rapid  and
intermediate  time-scales.  Moreover, these  cycles  affect  the
energy balance and provide key controls over biogenic trace gas
production.  Looking  at  the  carbon  fixation-organic  material
decomposition  as  a  linked  process, one  sees  that  some  of  the
carbon fixed by photosynthesis and incorporated into plant tissue
is  perhaps  delayed  from  returning  to  the  atmosphere  until  it  is
oxidised  by  decomposition  or  fire.  This  slower  carbon  loop
through the terrestrial component of the carbon cycle affects the
rate  of  growth  of  atmospheric  CO2 concentration  and, in  its
shorter term expression, imposes a seasonal cycle on that trend
(Chapter 3, Figure 3.2a). The structure of terrestrial ecosystems,
which respond on even longer time-scales, is determined by the
integrated response to changes in climate and to the intermediate
time-scale carbon-nutrient machinery. The loop is closed back to
the  climate  system, since  it  is  the  structure  of  ecosystems,
including  species  composition, that  largely  sets  the  terrestrial
boundary condition of the climate in terms of surface roughness,
albedo, and latent heat exchange (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2).
Modelling  interactions  between  terrestrial  and  atmospheric
systems requires coupling successional models to biogeochem-
ical models and physiological models that describe the exchange
of water and energy between vegetation and the atmosphere at
fine  time-scales.  At  each  step  toward  longer  time-scales, the
climate  system  integrates  the  more  fine-scaled  processes  and
applies feedbacks onto the terrestrial biome. At the finest time-
scales, the  influence  of  temperature, radiation, humidity  and
winds has a dramatic effect on the ability of plants to transpire.
On  longer  time-scales, integrated  weather  patterns  regulate
biological  processes  such  as  the  timing  of  leaf  emergence  or
excision, uptake of nitrogen by autotrophs, and rates of organic
soil  decay  and  turnover  of  inorganic  nitrogen.  The  effect  of
climate at the annual or interannual scale defines the net gain or
loss  of  carbon  by  the  biota, its  water  status  for  the  subsequent
growing season, and even its ability to survive.

As  the  temporal  scale  is  extended, the  development  of
dynamic vegetation models, which respond to climate and human
land use as well as other changes, is a central issue. These models
must  not  only  treat  successional  dynamics, but  also  ecosystem
redistribution. The recovery of natural vegetation in abandoned
areas  depends  upon  the  intensity  and  length  of  the  agricultural
activity and the amount of soil organic matter on the site at the
time  of  abandonment.  To  simulate  the  biogeochemistry  of
secondary  vegetation, models  must  capture  patterns  of  plant
growth  during  secondary  succession.  These  patterns  depend
substantially  on  the  nutrient  pools  inherited  from  the  previous
stage. The changes in hydrology need also to be considered, since
plants  that  experience  water  stress  will  alter  the  allocation  of
carbon  to  allocate  more  carbon  to  roots.  Processes  such  as
reproduction, establishment, and  light  competition  have  been
added  to  such  models, interactively  with  the  carbon, nitrogen,
and  water  cycles.  Disturbance  regimes  such  as  fire  are  also
incorporated into the models, and these disturbances are essential

in  order  to  treat  successfully  competitive  dynamics  and  hence
future patterns of ecosystem. It should be noted also that these
forcing  terms  themselves  might  be  altered  by  the  changes  that
result from changes in the terrestrial system.

This  coupling  across  time-scales  represents  a  significant
challenge.  Immediate  challenges  that  confront  models  of  the
terrestrial-atmosphere  system  include  exchanges  of  carbon  and
water  between  the  atmosphere  and  land, and  the  terrestrial
sources and sinks of trace gases. 

Prognostic models of terrestrial carbon cycle and terrestrial
ecosystem  processes  are  central  for  any  consideration  of  the
effects of environmental change and analysis of mitigation strate-
gies;  moreover, these  demands  will  become  even  more  signifi-
cant  as  countries  begin  to  adopt  carbon  emission  targets.  At
present, several  rather  complex  models  are  being  developed  to
account  for  the  ecophysiological  and  biophysical  processes,
which  determine  the  spatial  and  temporal  features  of  primary
production  and  respiration  (see  Chapter  3, Sections  3.6.2  and
3.7.1).  Despite  recent  progress  in  developing  and  evaluating
terrestrial  biosphere  models, several  crucial  questions  remain
open. For example, current models are highly inconsistent in the
way they treat the response of Net Primary Production (NPP) to
climate  variability  and  climate  change  –  even  though  this
response  is  fundamental  to  predictions  of  the  total  terrestrial
carbon balance in a changing climate. Models also differ signifi-
cantly in the degree of CO2 fertilisation they allow, and the extent
to which CO2 responses are constrained by nutrient availability;
the extent to which CO2 concentrations affect the global distribu-
tion of C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways; and the impacts of
climate, CO2 and  land  management  on  the  tree-grass  balance.
These are all areas where modelling capability is limited by lack
of  knowledge, thus  making  it  crucially  important  to  expand
observational  and  experimental  research.  Important  areas  are
interannual  variability  in  terrestrial  fluxes  and  the  interplay  of
warming, management, and  CO2 enrichment  responses  at  the
ecosystem  scale.  Moreover, these  issues  must  be  far  better
resolved  if  there  is  to  be  an  adequate  verification  scheme  to
confirm  national  performance  in  meeting  targets  for  CO2
emissions. (See Chapter 3, Sections 3.6.2 and 3.7.1.)

Finally, while progress will be made on modelling terrestrial
processes, more  integrative  studies  are  also  needed  wherein
terrestrial  systems  are  coupled  with  models  of  the  physical
atmosphere and eventually with the chemical atmosphere as well. 

14.2.5 Precipitation, Soil Moisture, and River Flow: Elements 

of the Hydrological Cycle

Changes  in  precipitation  could  have  significant  impacts  on
society. Precipitation is an essential element in determining the
availability  of  drinking  water  and  the  level  of  soil  moisture.
Improved  treatment  of  precipitation  (see  Section  Chapter  7,
7.2.3) is an essential step.

Soil moisture is a key component in the land surface schemes
in climate models, since it is closely related to evapotranspiration
and thus to the apportioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes. It
is  primary  in  the  formation  of  runoff  and  hence  river-flow.
Further, soil moisture is an important determinant of ecosystem

780

structure and therein a primary means by which climate regulates
(and  is  partially  regulated  by)  ecosystem  distribution.  Soil
moisture  is  an  important  regulator  of  plant  productivity  and
sustainability  of  natural  ecosystems.  In  turn  terrestrial  ecosys-
tems  recycle  water  vapour  at  the  land-surface/atmosphere
boundary, exchange  numerous  important  trace  gases  with  the
atmosphere, and transfer water and biogeochemical compounds
to  river  systems  (see  also  the  discussion  in  Chapter  7, Section
7.4.3 and Chapter 8, Section 8.5.4). New efforts are needed in the
development of models, which successfully represent the space-
time dynamics interaction between soil, climate and vegetation.
If  water  is  a  central  controlling  aspect, then  the  interaction
necessarily passes all the way through the space-time dynamics
of  soil  moisture.  Finally, adequate  soil  moisture  is  an  essential
resource for human activity. Consequently, accurate prediction of
soil moisture is crucial for simulation of the hydrological cycle,
of  soil  and  vegetation  biochemistry, including  the  cycling  of
carbon and nutrients, and of ecosystem structure and distribution
as well as climate. 

River  systems  are  linked  to  regional  and  continental-scale
hydrology through interactions among precipitation, evapotran-
spiration, soil water, and runoff in terrestrial ecosystems. River
systems, and more generally the entire global water cycle, control
the  movement  of  constituents  over  vast  distances, from  the
continental  land-masses  to  the  world’s  oceans  and  to  the
atmosphere. Rivers are also central features of human settlement
and development. 

It appears, however, that a significant level of variance exists
among  land  models, associated  with  unresolved  differences
among  parametrization  details  (particularly  difficulties  in  the
modelling of soil hydrology) and parameter sets. In fact, many
of the changes in land-surface models since the SAR fall within
this range of model diversity. It is not known to what extent these
differences in land-surface response translate into differences in
global  climate  sensitivity  (see  Chapter  8, Section  8.5.4.3)
although  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  land-surface
response  must  be  smaller  than  the  uncertainty  associated  with
clouds  (Lofgren, 1995).  There  is  model-based  evidence
indicating  that  these  differences  in  the  land-surface  response
may be significant for the simulation of the local land-surface
climate and regional atmospheric climate changes (see Chapter
7, Section 7.4). 

Much attention in the land-surface modelling community has
been directed toward the diversity of parametrizations of water
and energy fluxes (see Chapter 7, Sections 7.4, 7.5, and Chapter
8, Section  8.5).  Intercomparison  experiments  (see  Chapter  8,
Section  8.5.4)  have  quantified  the  inter-model  differences  in
response  to  prescribed  atmospheric  forcing, and  have
demonstrated that the most significant outliers can be understood
in terms of unrealistic physical approximations in their formula-
tion, particularly  the  neglect  of  stomatal  resistance.  Some
coupled models now employ some form of stomatal resistance to
evaporation. 

Climate-induced changes in vegetation have potentially large
climatic  implications, but  are  still  generally  neglected  in  the
coupled-model  experiments  used  to  estimate  future  changes  in
climate (see Chapter 8).

There is, obviously, a direct coupling between predicted soil
moisture and predicted river flows and the availability of water
for human use. Complex patterns of locally generated runoff are
transformed  into  horizontal  transport  as  rivers  through  the
drainage  basin.  Moreover, any  global  perspective  on  surface
hydrology  must  explicitly  recognise  the  impact  of  human
intervention  in  the  water  cycle, not  only  through  climate  and
land-use  change, but  also  through  the  operation  of  impound-
ments, inter-basin transfers, and consumptive use. 

Recognition  of  the  importance  of  land  hydrology  for  the
salinity  distribution  of  the  oceans  is  one  reason  for  seeking
improvements  in  models  for  routing  runoff  to  the  oceans  (see
more precise cites here and in Chapter 7). Most coupled models
now return land runoff to the ocean as fresh water (see Chapter
8). Runoff is collected over geographically realistic river basins
and  mixed  into  the  ocean  at  the  appropriate  river  mouths.
Although  this  routing  is  performed  instantaneously  in  some
models, the trend is toward model representation of the signifi-
cant time-lag (order of a month) in runoff production to river-
ocean  discharge.  What  is  needed  for  a  variety  of  reasons,
however, is for river flow itself to be treated in models of the
climate system. (See Chapter 7, Section 7.4.3.)

On  land, surface  processes  have  until  very  recently  been
treated summarily in Atmospheric General Circulation Models
(AGCMs). The focus of evaluating AGCMs has been on large-
scale dynamics and certain meteorological variables; far less so
on  the  partitioning  of  sensible  and  latent  heat  flux, or  the
moisture  content  of  the  planetary  boundary  layer.  When  the
goals  of  climate  modelling  are  expanded  to  include  terrestrial
biosphere function, such aspects become of central importance
as  regulators  of  the  interaction  between  the  carbon  and  water
cycles.  Terrestrial  flux  and  boundary-layer  measurements
represent  a  new, expanding  and  potentially  hugely  important
resource  for  improving  our  understanding  of  these  processes
and their representation in models of the climate system. (See
Chapter 7, Section 7.4.1.)

The  spatial  resolution  of  current  global  climate  models,
roughly 200 km, is too coarse to simulate the impact of global
change on most individual river basins. To verify the transport
models will require budgets of water and other biogeochemical
constituents for large basins of the world. This requires ground-
based meteorology in tandem with remotely sensed data for a
series of variables, including information on precipitation, soils,
land  cover, surface  radiation, status  of  the  vegetative  canopy,
topography, floodplain  extent, and  inundation.  Model  results
can  be  constrained  by  using  a  database  of  observed  discharge
and  constituent  fluxes  at  key  locations  within  the  drainage
basins  analysed.  Climate  time-series  and  monthly  discharge
data  for  the  past  several  decades  at  selected  locations  provide
the  opportunity  for  important  tests  of  models, including
appraisal of the impact of episodic events, such as El Niño, on
surface water balance and river discharge. It will be necessary to
inventory, document, and  make  available  such  data  sets  to
identify  gaps  in  our  knowledge, and  where  it  is  necessary  to
collect additional data. Even in the best-represented regions of
the globe coherent time-series are available for only the last 30
years or less. This lack of data constrains our ability to construct

Advancing Our Understanding

781

and test riverine flux models. Standardised protocols, in terms of
sampling frequency, spatial distribution of sampling networks,
and chemical analyses are needed to ensure the production of
comparable data sets in disparate parts of the globe. Upgrades of
the  basic  monitoring  system  for  discharge  and  riverborne
constituents at the large scale are therefore required.

In  sum, hydrological  processes  and  energy  exchange,
especially  those  involving  clouds, surface  exchanges, and
interactions  of  these  with  radiation  are  crucial  for  further
progress  in  modelling  the  atmosphere.  Feedbacks  with  land
require careful attention to the treatments of evapotranspiration,
soil moisture storage, and runoff. All of these occur on spatial
scales which are fine compared with the model meshes, so the
question  of  scaling  must  be  addressed.  These  improvements
must  be  paralleled  by  the  acquisition  of  global  data  sets  for
validation  of  these  treatments.  Validation  of  models  against
global and regional requirements for conservation of energy is
especially  important  in  this  regard.  As  noted  in  Chapter  8
(Section  8.5.4.3), “Uncertainty  in  land  surface  processes,
coupled  with  uncertainty  in  parameter  data  combines, at  this
time, to limit the confidence we have in the simulated regional
impacts of increasing CO2.”

14.2.6 Trace Gases, Aerosols, and the Climate System

The  goal  is  a  completely  interactive  simulation  of  the
dynamical, radiative, and chemical processes in the atmosphere-
ocean-land  system  with  a  central  theme  of  characterising
adequately the radiative forcing in the past, in the present, and
into  the  future  (See  Chapter  6, Sections  6.1  and  6.2;  see  also
Chapter 9, Section 9.1). Such a model will be essential in future
studies of the broad question on the role of the oceans, terrestrial
ecosystems, and  human  activities  in  the  regulation  of
atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other radiatively active
atmospheric constituents. It will be required for understanding
tropospheric trace constituents such as nitrogen oxides, ozone,
and sulphate aerosols. Nitrogen oxides are believed to control
the  production  and  destruction  of  tropospheric  ozone, which
controls the chemical reactivity of the lower atmosphere and is
itself  a  significant  greenhouse  gas.  Tropospheric  sulphate
aerosols, carbonaceous aerosols from both natural and anthro-
pogenic  processes, dust, and  sea  salt, on  the  other  hand, are
believed to affect the Earth’s radiation budget significantly, by
scattering  solar  radiation  and  through  their  effects  on  clouds.
Systematic observations of different terrestrial ecosystems and
surface  marine  systems  under  variable  meteorological
conditions are needed along with the development of ecosystem
and surface models that will provide parametrizations of these
exchanges.

Models  that  incorporate  atmospheric  chemical  processes
provide the basis for much of our current understanding in such
critical problem areas as acid rain, photochemical smog produc-
tion in the troposphere, and depletion of the ozone layer in the
stratosphere.  These  formidable  problems  require  models  that
include  chemical, dynamical, and  radiative  processes, which
through  their  mutual  interactions  determine  the  circulation,
thermal  structure, and  distribution  of  constituents  in  the

atmosphere.  That  is, the  problems  require  a  coupling  of  the
physics  and  chemistry  of  the  atmosphere.  Furthermore, the
models must be applicable on a variety of spatial (regional-to-
global) and temporal (days-to-decades) scales (see Chapter 6).
A  particularly  important  and  challenging  issue  is  the  need  to
reduce  the  uncertainty  on  the  size  and  spatial  pattern  of  the
indirect aerosol effects (see Chapter 6, Section 6.8).

Most  of  the  effort  in  three-dimensional  atmospheric
chemistry  models  over  the  last  decade  has  been  in  the  use  of
transport  models  in  the  analysis  of  certain  chemically  active
species, e.g., long-lived gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) or the
chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs).  In  part, the  purpose  of  these
studies was not to improve our understanding of the chemistry
of the atmosphere, but rather to improve the transport formula-
tion associated with general circulation models and, in associa-
tion with this improvement, to understand sources and sinks of
CO2. The additional burden imposed by incorporating detailed
chemistry into a comprehensive general circulation model has
made  long-term  simulations  and  transient  experiments  with
existing  computing  resources  challenging.  Current  three-
dimensional atmospheric chemistry models which focus on the
stratosphere seek a compromise solution by employing coarse
resolution  (both  vertical  and  horizontal  dimensions);  incorpo-
rating  constituents  by  families  (similar  to  the  practice  used  in
most  two-dimensional  models);  omitting  or  simplifying
parametrizations  for  tropospheric  physical  processes;  or
conducting “off line” transport simulations in which previously
calculated wind and temperature fields are used as known input
to  continuity  equations  including  chemical  source/sink  terms.
This  last  approach  renders  the  problem  tractable  and  has
produced much progress towards understanding the transport of
chemically reacting species in the atmosphere. The correspon-
ding  disadvantage  is  the  lack  of  the  interactive  feedback
between the evolving species distributions and the atmospheric
circulation.  Better  descriptions  of  the  complex  relationship
between  hydrogen, nitrogen, and  oxygen  species  as  well  as
hydrocarbons and other organic species are needed in order to
establish simplified chemical schemes that will be implemented
in chemical/transport models. In parallel, better descriptions of
how advection, turbulence, and convection affect the chemical
composition  of  the  atmosphere  are  needed.  (See  Chapter  4,
Section 4.5.2.)

We  also  need  improved  understanding  of  the  processes
involving clouds, surface exchanges, and their interactions with
radiation.  The  coupling  of  aerosols  with  both  the  energy  and
water cycles as well as with the chemistry components of the
system  is  of  increasing  importance.  Determining  feedbacks
between  the  land  surface  and  other  elements  of  the  climate
system  will  require  careful  attention  to  the  treatments  of
evapotranspiration, soil moisture storage and runoff. All of these
occur on spatial scales that are small compared with the model
meshes, so  the  question  of  scaling  must  be  addressed.  These
improvements  must  be  paralleled  by  the  acquisition  of  global
data sets for validation of these treatments. Validation of models
against  global  and  regional  requirements  for  conservation  of
energy  is  especially  important  in  this  regard.  (See  Chapter  4,
Section 4.5.1.)

782

Advancing Our Understanding

The problems associated with how to treat clouds within the
climate system are linked to problems associated with aerosols.
Current  model  treatments  of  climate  forcing  from  aerosols
predict  effects  that  are  not  easily  consistent  with  the  past
climate record. A major challenge is to develop and validate the
treatments of the microphysics of clouds and their interactions
with aerosols on the scale of a general circulation model grid. A
second major challenge is to develop an understanding of the
carbon  components  of  the  aerosol  system.  Meeting  this
challenge  requires  that  we  develop  data  for  a  mechanistic
understanding of carbonaceous aerosol effects on clouds as well
as developing an understanding of the magnitude of the anthro-
pogenic  and  natural  components  of  the  carbonaceous  aerosol
system. (See Chapter 6, Sections 6.7 and 6.8; see also Chapter
4, Section 4.5.1.2.)

As  attention  is  turned  toward  the  troposphere, the  experi-
mental strategy simply cannot adopt the stratospheric simplifi-
cations.  The  uneven  distribution  of  emission  sources  at  the
surface of the Earth and the role of meteorological processes at
various  scales  must  be  addressed  directly.  Fine-scaled, three-
dimensional  models  of  chemically  active  trace  gases  in  the
troposphere  are  needed  to  resolve  transport  processes  at  the
highest possible resolution. These models should be designed to
simulate the chemistry and transport of atmospheric tracers on
global  and  regional  scales, with  accurate  parametrizations  of
sub-scale processes that affect the chemical composition of the
troposphere.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  pursue  an  ambitious
long-term programme to develop comprehensive models of the
troposphere  system, including  chemical, dynamical, radiative,
and eventually biological components. (See Chapter 4, Sections
4.4 to 4.6.)

The  short-lived  radiatively  important  species  pose  an
observational  challenge.  The  fact  that  they  are  short-lived
implies that observations of the concentrations are needed over
wide  spatial  regions  and  over  long  periods  of  time.  This  is
particularly  important  for  aerosols.  The  current  uncertainties
are non-trivial (see again Chapter 6, Figure 6.7) and need to be
reduced.

In  sum, there  needs  to  be  an  expanded  attack  on  the  key
contributors to uncertainty about the behaviour of the climate
system today and in the future. As stated in Chapter 13, Section
13.1.2, “Scenarios  should  also  provide  adequate  quantitative
measures of uncertainty. The sources of uncertainty are many,
including  the  trajectory  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the
future, their  conversion  into  atmospheric  concentrations, the
range  of  responses  of  various  climate  models  to  a  given
radiative forcing and the method of constructing high resolution
information from global climate model outputs (see Chapter 13,
Figure  13.2).  For  many  purposes, simply  defining  a  single
climate  future  is  insufficient  and  unsatisfactory.    Multiple
climate scenarios that address at least one, or preferably several,
sources of uncertainty allow these uncertainties to be quantified
and explicitly accounted for in impact assessments.”

In  addition  to  this  needed  expansion  in  the  attack  on
uncertainties in the climate system, there is an important new
challenge that should now be addressed more aggressively. It is
time  to  link  more  formally  physical  climate-biogeochemical

models with models of the human system. At present, human
influences  generally  are  treated  only  through  emission
scenarios that provide external forcings to the climate system.
In future comprehensive models, human activities will interact
with  the  dynamics  of  physical, chemical, and  biological  sub-
systems  through  a  diverse  set  of  contributing  activities,
feedbacks, and  responses.  This  does  not  mean  that  it  is
necessary  or  even  logical  to  attempt  to  develop  prognostic
models  of  human  actions  since  much  will  remain  inherently
unpredictable; however, the scenarios analysis could and should
be more fully coupled to the coupled physical climate-biogeo-
chemical system.  

As  part  of  the  foundation-building  to  meet  this  challenge,

we turn attention now to the human system.

14.3 The Human System

14.3.1 Overview

Human processes are critically linked to the climate system as
contributing  causes  of  global  change, as  determinants  of
impacts, and  through  responses.  Representing  these  linkages
poses perhaps the greatest challenge to modelling the total Earth
system. But understanding them is essential to understanding the
behaviour of the whole system and to providing useful advice to
inform policy and response. Significant progress has been made,
but formidable challenges remain. 

Human  activities  have  altered  the  Earth  system, and  many
such  influences  are  accelerating  with  population  growth  and
technological development. The use of fossil fuels and chemical
fertilisers are major influences, as is the human transformation
of much of the Earth’s surface in the past 300 years.

Land-use  change  illustrates  the  potential  complexity  of
linkages  between  human  activity  and  major  non-human
components  of  the  Earth  system.  The  terrestrial  biosphere  is
fundamentally  modified  by  land  clearing  for  agriculture,
industrialisation, urbanisation, and  by  forest  and  rangeland
management  practices.  These  changes  affect  the  atmosphere
through  an  altered  energy  balance  over  the  more  intensively
managed parts of the land surface, as well as through changed
fluxes of water vapour, CO2, CH4 and other trace gases between
soils, vegetation, and  the  atmosphere.  Changed  land  use  also
greatly  alters  the  fluxes  of  carbon, nutrients, and  inorganic
sediments  into  river  systems, and  consequently  into  oceanic
coastal zones.

The  response  of  the  total  Earth  system  to  these  changes  in
anthropogenic forcing is currently not known. Sensitivity studies
with altered land cover distributions in general circulation models
have shown that drastic changes, such as total deforestation of all
tropical or boreal forests, may lead to feedbacks in atmospheric
circulation  and  a  changed  climate  that  would  not  support  the
original  vegetation  (e.g., Claussen, 1996).  Regional  climate
simulations, on the other hand, have shown that at the continental
scale, important teleconnections may exist through which more
modest tropical forest clearing may cause a change in climate in
undisturbed  areas.  Coupling  the  global  to  the  local  is  a  key
challenge; regional studies may prove to be uniquely valuable.

Advancing Our Understanding

783

Human  land-use  change  will  continue  and  probably
accelerate due to increasing demands for food and fibre, changes
in  forest  and  water  management  practices, and  possibly  large-
scale  projects  to  sequester  carbon  in  forests  or  to  produce
biomass  fuels.  In  addition, anthropogenic  changes  in  material
and  energy  fluxes, resulting  from  such  activities  as  fossil  fuel
combustion and chemical fertiliser use, are expected to increase
in the coming decades. Predictions of changes in the carbon and
nitrogen cycles are sensitive to estimates of human activity and
predictions of the impacts of these global changes must take into
account  human  vulnerability, adaptation, and  response.
Predicting the future response of the Earth system to changes in
climate and in parallel to changes in land use and land cover will
require projections of trends in the human contributions to these
global  changes;  this  sort  of  modelling  presents  difficult
challenges  because  of  the  multiple  factors  operating  at  local,
regional, continental, and global levels to influence local land-
use decisions.

In  sum, the  human  element  probably  represents  the  most
important aspect both of the causes and effects of climate change
and  environmental  impacts.  Any  policy  intervention  will  have
human activities as its immediate target. 

14.3.2 Humans: Drivers of Global Change: Recipients of 

Global Change

The  provision  of  useful  guidance  to  inform  policy  requires
observation  and  description  of  human  contributions  to  global
change, as  well  as  theoretical  studies  of  the  underlying  social
processes that shape them. We also need to understand how global
change affects human welfare. This requires not merely studies of
direct exposure but also of the capacity to respond.

Causal  models  of  social  processes  have  large  uncertainties,
and pose problems that are of a qualitatively different character
than those encountered in modelling non-human components of
the Earth system. This is due, first and foremost, to the inherent
reflexivity of human behaviour; i.e., the fact that human beings
have intellectual capabilities and emotional endowments enabling
them to invent new solutions and transcend established “laws” in
ways that no other species can do. As a consequence, predictive
models may well alter the behaviour that they seek to predict and
explain  –  indeed, such  models  are  sometimes  deliberately  used
exactly  for  that  purpose.  Moreover, the  diversity  of  societies,
cultures, and  political  and  economic  systems  often  frustrates
attempts to generalise findings and propositions from one setting
to  another.  Representation  of  human  behaviour  at  the  micro
(individual) and macro (collective) scale may require fundamen-
tally different approaches (see Gibson et al., 1998).

These  kinds  of  difficulties  intrinsically  limit  the  predictive
power  that  can  be  ascribed  to  models  of  social  processes. As  a
consequence, research on human drivers and responses to climate
change  cannot  be  expected  to  produce  conventional  predictions
beyond a very short time horizon. This does not imply, however,
that  research  on  human  behaviour  and  social  processes  cannot
provide  knowledge  and  insight  that  can  inform  policy  delibera-
tions.  A  considerable  amount  of  basic  knowledge  and  insight
exist, and this knowledge can be used, inter alia, for constructing

scenarios  showing  plausible  trajectories  and  identifying  the
critical factors that will have to be targeted in order to switch from
one trajectory to another. From the perspective of policy-makers,
this can indeed be an important contribution.

To make the most of this potential, further progress is required
along  two  main  frontiers.  One  challenge  is  to  develop  a  more
integrated understanding of social systems and human behaviour.
With some exceptions, the first generation of models in this area
represented  “the  human  system” by  a  few  key  variables.  For
example, resource  use  was  often  conceived  of  as  a  function  of
population  size  and  income  level.  The  performance  of  such
simplistic  models  was  by-and-large  poor.  It  is  abundantly  clear
that the impact of human activities as drivers of climate change
depends upon a complex set of interrelated factors, including also
technologies  in  use, social  institutions, and  individual  beliefs,
attitudes, and values. At present, it seems fair to say that we have
a reasonably good theoretical grasp of important types of institu-
tions, such as markets and hierarchies, in ideal-type form. What
we  need  to  understand  better  is  how  their  impure  real-world
counterparts  work, and  to  improve  our  understanding  of  the
intricate  interplay  of  institutional  complexes, i.e., how  markets,
governments and other social institutions interact to shape human
behaviour.  Research  in  political  economy  clearly  indicates  that
phenomena such as economic growth are to a significant extent
affected  by  the  functioning  of  interlocking  networks  of  institu-
tional arrangements. 

Similarly, we have a fairly good grasp on particular kinds of
intellectual processes − in particular, the logic of rational choice −
but we are doing less well when it comes to understanding how
beliefs, attitudes  and  values  change  and  how  change  in  these
factors  in  turn  affects  manifest  human  behaviour, such  as
consumption patterns. To address these challenges we need more
interdisciplinary  research  designed  to  integrate  knowledge  from
different fields and sub-fields into a more holistic understanding
of  “the  human  system”.  The  intellectual  and  organisational
problems  involved  should  not  be  underestimated, but  we  are
confident  that  the  prospects  for  making  progress  along  this
frontier are better now than ever before.

The other main challenge is to find better ways of integrating
models of the biogeophysical Earth system with models of social
systems  and  human  behaviour.  Some  encouraging  progress  has
been made at this interface, particularly over the last decade. For
example, there has been a rapid increase in attempts to integrate
representations of human activities in models with explicit formal
linkages to other components of the Earth system. Such integrated
assessment models have offered preliminary characterisations of
human-climate linkages, particularly through models of multiple
linked human and climate stresses on land cover. Moreover, they
have  provided  preliminary  characterisation  of  broad  classes  of
policy  responses, and  have  been  employed  to  characterise  and
prioritise policy-relevant uncertainties. 

Yet, effective  integration  is  frustrated  by  at  least  two  main
obstacles. One is incongruity of temporal and spatial scales. Social
science  research  cannot  match  the  long  time  horizons  of  much
natural  science  research.  On  the  other  hand, in  studying
consequences  for  human  welfare  and  responses  to  these
consequences, social  scientists  need  estimates  of  biophysical

784

Advancing Our Understanding

impacts of climate change differentiated by political units or even
smaller  social  systems. Aggregate  global-scale  estimates  are  of
limited use in this context; human sensitivity to climate change
varies significantly across regions and social groups, and so does
response capacity. We can expect to see some progress in allevi-
ating the spatial resolution problem, as regional-scale models of
climate change are further developed, but we have to recognise
that the scale problems are fundamental and that no quick fixes are
in  sight.  The  other  problem  pertains  to  the  interface  between
different  methodological  approaches.  In  particular, concerted
efforts are required to develop better tools for coupling approaches
relying  on  numerical  modelling  with  “softer” approaches  using
interpretative frameworks and qualitative methods. Some of these
differences are too profound to be eliminated, but that does not
imply that bridges cannot be built. Learning how to work more
effectively across these methodological divides is essential to the
further development of integrated global change research. Again,
some encouraging progress is being made. 

14.4 Outlook

There is a growing recognition in the scientific community and
more broadly that:

• The Earth functions as a system, with properties and behaviour
that are characteristic of the system as a whole.  These include
critical  thresholds, “switch” or  “control” points, strong  non-
linearities, teleconnections, chaotic elements, and unresolvable
uncertainties.    Understanding  the  components  of  the  Earth
system is critically important, but is insufficient on its own to
understand the functioning of the Earth system as a whole.

• Humans are now a significant force in the Earth system, altering
key process rates and absorbing the impacts of global environ-
mental  changes.  The  environmental  significance  of  human
activities is now so profound that the current geological era can
be called the “Anthropocene” (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000).

A scientific understanding of the Earth system is required to
help human societies develop in ways that sustain the global life
support  system.  The  clear  challenge  of  understanding  climate
variability  and  change  and  the  associated  consequences  and
feedbacks is a specific and important example of the need for a
scientific understanding of the Earth as a system. It is also clear
that the scientific study of the whole Earth system, taking account
of  its  full  functional  and  geographical  complexity  over  time,
requires an unprecedented effort of international collaboration.  It
is well beyond the scope of individual countries and regions. 

The world’s scientific community, working in part through the
three global environmental change programmes (the International
Geosphere-Biosphere  Programme  (IGBP), the  International
Human  Dimensions  Programme  on  Global  Environmental
Change  (IHDP), and  the  World  Climate  Research  Programme
(WCRP)), has  built  a  solid  base  for  understanding  the  Earth
system.  The  IGBP, IHDP  and  WCRP  have  also  developed
effective and efficient strategies for implementing global environ-
mental change research at the international level. The challenge to

IGBP, IHDP and WCRP is to build an international programme of
Earth system science, driven by a common mission and common
questions, employing visionary and creative scientific approaches,
and  based  on  an  ever  closer  collaboration  across  disciplines,
research themes, programmes, nations and regions. 

We need to build on our existing understanding of the Earth
system  and  its  interactive  human  and  non-human  processes
through time in order to:

•  improve  evaluation  and  understanding  of  current  and  future

global change; and

• place on an increasingly firm scientific basis the challenge of
sustaining the global environment for future human societies.

The  climate  system  is  particularly  challenging  since  it  is
known that components in the system are inherently chaotic, and
there are central components which affect the system in a non-
linear  manner  and  potentially  could  switch  the  sign  of  critical
feedbacks. The non-linear processes include the basic dynamical
response of the climate system and the interactions between the
different components. These complex, non-linear dynamics are an
inherent aspect of the climate system. Amongst the important non-
linear processes are the role of clouds, the thermohaline circula-
tion, and sea ice. There are other broad non-linear components,
the biogeochemical system and, in particular, the carbon system,
the hydrological cycle, and the chemistry of the atmosphere.

Given the complexity of the climate system and the inherent
multi-decadal time-scale, there is a central and unavoidable need
for  long-term  consistent  data  to  support  climate  and  environ-
mental change investigations. Data from the present and recent
past, credible  global  climate-relevant  data  for  the  last  few
centuries, along  with  lower  frequency  data  for  the  last  several
millennia, are all needed.  Research observational data sets that
span  significant  temporal  and  spatial  scales  are  needed  so  that
models can be refined, validated, or perhaps, most importantly,
rejected. The elimination of models because they are in conflict
with  climate-relevant  data  is  particularly  important.  Running
unrealistic models will consume scarce computing resources, and
the results may add unrealistic information to the needed distri-
bution  functions.  Such  data  must  be  adequate  in  temporal  and
spatial  coverage, in  parameters  measured, and  in  precision, to
permit meaningful validation. We are still unfortunately short of
data  for  the  quantitative  assessment  of  extremes  on  the  global
scale in the observed climate.

In sum, there is a need for:

• more  comprehensive  data, contemporary, historical, and

palaeological, relevant to the climate system;

• expanded  process  studies  that  more  clearly  elucidate  the
structure of fundamental components of the Earth system and
the potential for changes in these central components;

• greater  effort  in  testing  and  developing  increasingly  compre-

hensive and sophisticated Earth system models;

Advancing Our Understanding

785

• increased emphasis upon producing ensemble calculations of
Earth system models that yield descriptions of the likelihood of
a broad range of different possibilities, and finally;

• new  efforts  in  understanding  the  fundamental  behaviour  of

large-scale non-linear systems.

These are significant challenges, but they are not insurmountable.
The  challenges  to  understanding  the  Earth  system  including  the
human component are daunting, and the pressing needs are signif-
icant. However, the opportunity for progress exists, and, in fact, this
opportunity simply must be realised. The issues are too important,
and they will not vanish. The challenges simply must be met.

Glossary

Editor: A.P.M. Baede

A → indicates that the following term is also contained in this Glossary.

Adjustment time
See: →Lifetime; see also: →Response time.

Aerosols
A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical
size between 0.01 and 10 µm and residing in the atmosphere for
at  least  several  hours.  Aerosols  may  be  of  either  natural  or
anthropogenic  origin.  Aerosols  may  influence  climate  in  two
ways: directly  through  scattering  and  absorbing  radiation, and
indirectly  through  acting  as  condensation  nuclei  for  cloud
formation  or  modifying  the  optical  properties  and  lifetime  of
clouds. See: →Indirect aerosol effect.

The term has also come to be associated, erroneously, with

the propellant used in “aerosol sprays”.

Afforestation
Planting  of  new  forests  on  lands  that  historically  have  not
contained  forests.  For  a  discussion  of  the  term  →forest  and
related  terms  such  as  afforestation, →reforestation, and
→deforestation: see  the  IPCC  Report  on  Land  Use, Land-Use
Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).

Albedo
The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface or object,
often expressed as a percentage. Snow covered surfaces have a
high albedo; the albedo of soils ranges from high to low; vegeta-
tion covered surfaces and oceans have a low albedo. The Earth’s
albedo varies mainly through varying cloudiness, snow, ice, leaf
area and land cover changes.

centrimetric  precision. Altimetry  has  the  advantage  of  being  a
measurement relative to a geocentric reference frame, rather than
relative to land level as for a →tide gauge, and of affording quasi-
global coverage.

Anthropogenic
Resulting from or produced by human beings.

Atmosphere
The  gaseous  envelope  surrounding  the  Earth.  The  dry
atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume
mixing  ratio)  and  oxygen  (20.9%  volume  mixing  ratio),
together  with  a  number  of  trace  gases, such  as  argon  (0.93%
volume  mixing  ratio), helium, and  radiatively  active
→greenhouse gases such as →carbon dioxide (0.035% volume
mixing ratio), and ozone. In addition the atmosphere contains
water vapour, whose amount is highly variable but typically 1%
volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and
→aerosols.

Attribution
See: →Detection and attribution.

Autotrophic respiration
→Respiration by photosynthetic organisms (plants).

Biomass
The  total  mass  of  living  organisms  in  a  given  area  or  volume;
recently dead plant material is often included as dead biomass.

Altimetry
A technique for the measurement of the elevation of the sea, land
or ice surface. For example, the height of the sea surface (with
respect to the centre of the Earth or, more conventionally, with
respect to a standard “ellipsoid of revolution”) can be measured
from  space  by  current  state-of-the-art  radar  altimetry  with

Biosphere (terrestrial and marine)
The  part  of  the  Earth  system  comprising  all →ecosystems  and
living  organisms, in  the  atmosphere, on  land  (terrestrial
biosphere) or in the oceans (marine biosphere), including derived
dead organic matter, such as litter, soil organic matter and oceanic
detritus.

Appendix I

Black carbon
Operationally  defined  species  based  on  measurement  of  light
absorption  and  chemical  reactivity  and/or  thermal  stability;
consists of soot, charcoal, and/or possible light-absorbing refrac-
tory organic matter. (Source: Charlson and Heintzenberg, 1995,
p. 401.)

Burden
The  total  mass  of  a  gaseous  substance  of  concern  in  the
atmosphere.

Carbonaceous aerosol
Aerosol  consisting  predominantly  of  organic  substances  and
various  forms  of  →black  carbon.  (Source: Charlson  and
Heintzenberg, 1995, p. 401.)

Carbon cycle
The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various forms,
e.g. as carbon dioxide) through the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial
→biosphere and lithosphere.

Carbon dioxide (CO2)
A  naturally  occurring  gas, also  a  by-product  of  burning  fossil
fuels  and  →biomass, as  well  as  →land-use  changes  and  other
industrial  processes.    It  is  the  principal  anthropogenic
→greenhouse gas that affects the earth’s radiative balance.  It is
the  reference  gas  against  which  other  greenhouse  gases  are
measured and therefore has a →Global Warming Potential of 1.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilisation
The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased
atmospheric CO2 concentration. Depending on their mechanism
of →photosynthesis, certain types of plants are more sensitive to
changes in atmospheric CO2 concentratioin. In particular, →C3
plants generally show a larger response to CO2 than →C4 plants.

Charcoal
Material  resulting  from  charring  of  biomass, usually  retaining
some  of  the  microscopic  texture  typical  of  plant  tissues;
chemically it consists mainly of carbon with a disturbed graphitic
structure, with  lesser  amounts  of  oxygen  and  hydrogen.  See:
→Black  carbon;  Soot  particles.  (Source: Charlson  and
Heintzenberg, 1995, p. 402.)

Climate
Climate  in  a  narrow  sense  is  usually  defined  as  the  “average
weather”, or  more  rigorously, as  the  statistical  description  in
terms  of  the  mean  and  variability  of  relevant  quantities  over  a
period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of
years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World
Meteorological  Organization (WMO). These quantities are most
often  surface  variables  such  as  temperature, precipitation, and
wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical
description, of the →climate system.

Climate change
Climate  change  refers  to  a  statistically  significant  variation  in

either the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting
for  an  extended  period  (typically  decades  or  longer).  Climate
change  may  be  due  to  natural  internal  processes  or  external
forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composi-
tion of the atmosphere or in land use.
Note  that  the  →Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change
(UNFCCC), in  its  Article  1, defines  “climate  change” as: “a
change  of  climate  which  is  attributed  directly  or  indirectly  to
human  activity  that  alters  the  composition  of  the  global
atmosphere  and  which  is  in  addition  to  natural  climate
variability  observed  over  comparable  time  periods”.  The
UNFCCC  thus  makes  a  distinction  between  “climate  change”
attributable  to  human  activities  altering  the  atmospheric
composition, and  “climate  variability” attributable  to  natural
causes.
See also: →Climate variability.

Climate feedback
An interaction mechanism between processes in the →climate
system is called a climate feedback, when the result of an initial
process  triggers  changes  in  a  second  process  that  in  turn
influences  the  initial  one.  A  positive  feedback  intensifies  the
original process, and a negative feedback reduces it.

Climate model (hierarchy)
A numerical representation of the →climate system based on the
physical, chemical and biological properties of its components,
their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for all
or  some  of  its  known  properties.  The  climate  system  can  be
represented  by  models  of  varying  complexity, i.e.  for  any  one
component or combination of components a hierarchy of models
can  be  identified, differing  in  such  aspects  as  the  number  of
spatial  dimensions, the  extent  to  which  physical, chemical  or
biological  processes  are  explicitly  represented, or  the  level  at
which  empirical  →parametrizations  are  involved.  Coupled
atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice  General  Circulation  Models
(AOGCMs)  provide  a  comprehensive  representation  of  the
climate  system.  There  is  an  evolution  towards  more  complex
models with active chemistry and biology.

Climate models are applied, as a research tool, to study and
simulate the climate, but also for operational purposes, including
monthly, seasonal and interannual →climate predictions.

Climate prediction
A  climate  prediction  or  climate  forecast  is  the  result  of  an
attempt to produce a most likely description or estimate of the
actual  evolution  of  the  climate  in  the  future, e.g.  at  seasonal,
interannual  or  long-term  time  scales.  See  also: →Climate
projection and →Climate (change) scenario.

Climate projection
A  →projection  of  the  response  of  the  climate  system  to
→emission or concentration scenarios of greenhouse gases and
aerosols, or  →radiative  forcing  scenarios, often  based  upon
simulations by →climate models. Climate projections are distin-
guished from →climate predictions in order to emphasise that
climate  projections  depend  upon  the  emission/concentration/

Appendix I

radiative forcing scenario used, which are based on assumptions,
concerning, e.g., future  socio-economic  and  technological
developments, that may or may not be realised, and are therefore
subject to substantial uncertainty.

Climate scenario
A  plausible  and  often  simplified  representation  of  the  future
climate, based on an internally consistent set of climatological
relationships, that  has  been  constructed  for  explicit  use  in
investigating  the  potential  consequences  of  anthropogenic
→climate  change, often  serving  as  input  to  impact  models.
→Climate  projections  often  serve  as  the  raw  material  for
constructing  climate  scenarios, but  climate  scenarios  usually
require  additional  information  such  as  about  the  observed
current  climate.  A  climate  change  scenario is  the  difference
between a climate scenario and the current climate.

Climate sensitivity
In  IPCC  Reports, equilibrium  climate  sensitivity  refers  to  the
equilibrium  change  in  global  mean  surface  temperature
following  a  doubling  of  the  atmospheric  (→equivalent)  CO2
concentration.  More  generally, equilibrium  climate  sensitivity
refers  to  the  equilibrium  change  in  surface  air  temperature
following  a  unit  change  in  →radiative  forcing  (°C/Wm−2).  In
practice, the  evaluation  of  the  equilibrium  climate  sensitivity
requires  very  long  simulations  with  Coupled  General
Circulation Models (→Climate model). 

The  effective  climate  sensitivity  is  a  related  measure  that
circumvents this requirement. It is evaluated from model output
for evolving non-equilibrium conditions. It is a measure of the
strengths of the →feedbacks at a particular time and may vary
with forcing history and climate state. Details are discussed in
Section 9.2.1 of Chapter 9 in this Report.

Climate system
The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of
five  major  components: the →atmosphere, the →hydrosphere,
the →cryosphere, the land surface and the →biosphere, and the
interactions between them. The climate system evolves in time
under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because of
external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations and
human-induced  forcings  such  as  the  changing  composition  of
the atmosphere and →land-use change.

Climate variability
Climate  variability  refers  to  variations  in  the  mean  state  and
other  statistics  (such  as  standard  deviations, the  occurrence  of
extremes, etc.) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales
beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due
to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal
variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external
forcing (external variability). See also: →Climate change.

Cloud condensation nuclei
Airborne particles that serve as an initial site for the condensa-
tion of liquid water and which can lead to the formation of cloud
droplets. See also: →Aerosols.

CO2  fertilisation
See →Carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilisation

Cooling degree days
The integral over a day of the temperature above 18°C (e.g. a
day with an average temperature of 20°C counts as 2 cooling
degree days). See also: →Heating degree days.

Cryosphere
The component of the →climate system consisting of all snow,
ice and permafrost on and beneath the surface of the earth and
ocean. See: →Glacier; →Ice sheet.

C3 plants
Plants  that  produce  a  three-carbon  compound  during  photo-
synthesis;  including  most  trees  and  agricultural  crops  such  as
rice, wheat, soyabeans, potatoes and vegetables.

C4 plants
Plants  that  produce  a  four-carbon  compound  during  photo-
synthesis; mainly of tropical origin, including grasses and the
agriculturally  important  crops  maize, sugar  cane, millet  and
sorghum.

Deforestation
Conversion of forest to non-forest. For a discussion of the term
→forest  and  related  terms  such  as  →afforestation,
→reforestation, and  deforestation: see  the  IPCC  Report  on
Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).

Desertification
Land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas
resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and
human  activities.  Further, the  UNCCD  (The  United  Nations
Convention  to  Combat  Desertification)  defines  land  degrada-
tion as a reduction or loss, in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid
areas, of  the  biological  or  economic  productivity  and
complexity  of  rain-fed  cropland, irrigated  cropland, or  range,
pasture, forest, and woodlands resulting from land uses or from
a  process  or  combination  of  processes, including  processes
arising from human activities and habitation patterns, such as:
(i) soil erosion caused by wind and/or water; (ii) deterioration
of the physical, chemical and biological or economic properties
of soil; and (iii) long-term loss of natural vegetation.

Detection and attribution
Climate  varies  continually  on  all  time  scales.  Detection of
→climate change is the process of demonstrating that climate
has  changed  in  some  defined  statistical  sense, without
providing  a  reason  for  that  change.  Attribution of  causes  of
climate  change  is  the  process  of  establishing  the  most  likely
causes  for  the  detected  change  with  some  defined  level  of
confidence.

Diurnal temperature range
The difference between the maximum and minimum tempera-
ture during a day.

790

Appendix I

Dobson Unit (DU)
A unit to measure the total amount of ozone in a vertical column
above  the  Earth’s  surface. The  number  of  Dobson  Units  is  the
thickness in units of 10−5 m, that the ozone column would occupy
if  compressed  into  a  layer  of  uniform  density  at  a  pressure  of
1013 hPa, and a temperature of 0°C. One DU corresponds to a
column  of  ozone  containing  2.69 ×  1020 molecules  per  square
meter. A typical value for the amount of ozone in a column of the
Earth’s atmosphere, although very variable, is 300 DU.

Ecosystem
A  system  of  interacting  living  organisms  together  with  their
physical environment. The boundaries of what could be called an
ecosystem  are  somewhat  arbitrary, depending  on  the  focus  of
interest or study. Thus the extent of an ecosystem may range from
very small spatial scales to, ultimately, the entire Earth.

El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
El  Niño, in  its  original  sense, is  a  warm  water  current  which
periodically  flows  along  the  coast  of  Ecuador  and  Peru,
disrupting the local fishery. This oceanic event is associated with
a  fluctuation  of  the  intertropical  surface  pressure  pattern  and
circulation in the Indian and Pacific oceans, called the Southern
Oscillation.  This  coupled  atmosphere-ocean  phenomenon  is
collectively  known  as El  Niño-Southern  Oscillation, or  ENSO.
During an El Niño event, the prevailing trade winds weaken and
the equatorial countercurrent strengthens, causing warm surface
waters in the Indonesian area to flow eastward to overlie the cold
waters  of  the  Peru  current. This  event  has  great  impact  on  the
wind, sea  surface  temperature  and  precipitation  patterns  in  the
tropical  Pacific.  It  has  climatic  effects  throughout  the  Pacific
region and in many other parts of the world. The opposite of an
El Niño event is called La Niña.

Emission scenario
A  plausible  representation  of  the  future  development  of
emissions  of  substances  that  are  potentially  radiatively  active
(e.g. →greenhouse gases, →aerosols), based on a coherent and
internally  consistent  set  of  assumptions  about  driving  forces
(such as demographic and socio-economic development, techno-
logical change) and their key relationships.

Concentration  scenarios, derived  from  emission  scenarios,
are  used  as  input  into  a  climate  model  to  compute  →climate
projections.

In  IPCC  (1992)  a  set  of  emission  scenarios  was  presented
which were used as a basis for the →climate projections in IPCC
(1996).  These  emission  scenarios  are  referred  to  as  the  IS92
scenarios.  In  the  IPCC  Special  Report  on  Emission  Scenarios
(Nakic´enovic´ et al., 2000) new emission scenarios, the so called
→SRES  scenarios, were  published  some  of  which  were  used,
among others, as a basis for the climate projections presented in
Chapter 9 of this Report. For the meaning of some terms related
to these scenarios, see →SRES scenarios.

climate system derives all its energy from the Sun, this balance
implies that, globally, the amount of incoming →solar radiation
must on average be equal to the sum of the outgoing reflected
solar radiation and the outgoing →infrared radiation emitted by
the  climate  system.  A  perturbation  of  this  global  radiation
balance, be  it  human  induced  or  natural, is  called  →radiative
forcing.

Equilibrium and transient climate experiment
An equilibrium climate experiment is an experiment in which a
→climate  model  is  allowed  to  fully  adjust  to  a  change  in
→radiative forcing. Such experiments provide information on the
difference between the initial and final states of the model, but
not on the time-dependent response. If the forcing is allowed to
evolve gradually according to a prescribed →emission scenario,
the time dependent response of a climate model may be analysed.
Such  experiment  is  called  a transient  climate  experiment. See:
→Climate projection.

Equivalent CO2 (carbon dioxide)
The concentration of →CO2 that would cause the same amount
of  →radiative  forcing  as  a  given  mixture  of  CO2 and  other
→greenhouse gases.

Eustatic sea-level change
A  change  in  global  average  sea  level  brought  about  by  an
alteration to the volume of the world ocean. This may be caused
by  changes  in  water  density  or  in  the  total  mass  of  water.  In
discussions  of  changes  on  geological  time-scales, this  term
sometimes  also  includes  changes  in  global  average  sea  level
caused by an alteration to the shape of the ocean basins. In this
Report the term is not used with that sense.

Evapotranspiration
The  combined  process  of  evaporation  from  the  Earth’s  surface
and transpiration from vegetation.

External forcing
See: →Climate system.

Extreme weather event
An extreme weather event is an event that is rare within its statis-
tical  reference  distribution  at  a  particular  place.  Definitions  of
“rare” vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as
rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile. By definition, the
characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary from
place to place.

An  extreme  climate  event is  an  average  of  a  number  of
weather events over a certain period of time, an average which is
itself extreme (e.g. rainfall over a season).

Faculae
Bright patches on the Sun. The area covered by faculae is greater
during periods of high →solar activity.

Energy balance
Averaged over the globe and over longer time periods, the energy
budget of the →climate system must be in balance. Because the

Flux adjustment
To avoid the problem of coupled atmosphere-ocean general
circulation  models  drifting  into  some  unrealistic  climate
state, adjustment  terms  can  be  applied  to  the  atmosphere-
ocean  fluxes  of  heat  and  moisture  (and  sometimes  the
surface stresses resulting from the effect of the wind on the
ocean surface) before these fluxes are imposed on the model
ocean  and  atmosphere.  Because  these  adjustments  are
precomputed  and  therefore  independent  of  the  coupled
model  integration, they  are  uncorrelated  to  the  anomalies
which  develop  during  the  integration.  In  Chapter  8  of  this
Report  it  is  concluded  that  present  models  have  a  reduced
need for flux adjustment.

Forest
A  vegetation  type  dominated  by  trees.  Many  definitions  of  the
term  forest  are  in  use  throughout  the  world, reflecting  wide
differences  in  bio-geophysical  conditions, social  structure, and
economics.  For a discussion of the term forest and related terms
such as →afforestation, →reforestation, and →deforestation: see
the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
(IPCC, 2000).

Fossil CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions
Emissions of CO2 resulting from the combustion of fuels from
fossil carbon deposits such as oil, gas and coal. 

Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  See: →United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

General Circulation 
The  large  scale  motions  of  the  atmosphere  and  the  ocean  as  a
consequence of differential heating on a rotating Earth, aiming to
restore the →energy balance of the system through transport of
heat and momentum.

General Circulation Model (GCM)
See: →Climate model.

Geoid
The surface which an ocean of uniform density would assume if
it were in steady state and at rest (i.e. no ocean circulation and no
applied forces other than the gravity of the Earth). This implies
that the geoid will be a surface of constant gravitational potential,
which can serve as a reference surface to which all surfaces (e.g.,
the Mean Sea Surface) can be referred. The geoid (and surfaces
parallel to the geoid) are what we refer to in common experience
as “level surfaces”.

Glacier
A mass of land ice flowing downhill (by internal deformation and
sliding  at  the  base)  and  constrained  by  the  surrounding
topography e.g. the sides of a valley or surrounding peaks; the
bedrock topography is the major influence on the dynamics and
surface slope of a glacier. A glacier is maintained by accumula-
tion  of  snow  at  high  altitudes, balanced  by  melting  at  low
altitudes or discharge into the sea.

Global surface temperature
The  global  surface  temperature  is  the  area-weighted  global
average of (i) the sea-surface temperature over the oceans (i.e. the
subsurface bulk temperature in the first few meters of the ocean),
and (ii) the surface-air temperature over land at 1.5 m above the
ground.

Global Warming Potential (GWP)
An index, describing the radiative characteristics of well mixed
→greenhouse  gases, that  represents  the  combined  effect  of  the
differing  times  these  gases  remain  in  the  atmosphere  and  their
relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing →infrared radiation.
This index approximates the time-integrated warming effect of a
unit  mass  of  a  given  greenhouse  gas  in  today’s  atmosphere,
relative to that of →carbon dioxide.

Greenhouse effect 
→Greenhouse  gases  effectively  absorb  →infrared  radiation,
emitted by the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the
same gases, and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all
sides, including  downward  to  the  Earth’s  surface.  Thus
greenhouse  gases  trap  heat  within  the  surface-troposphere
system. This is called the natural greenhouse effect.

Atmospheric radiation is strongly coupled to the temperature
of  the  level  at  which  it  is  emitted.  In  the  →troposphere  the
temperature generally decreases with height. Effectively, infrared
radiation  emitted  to  space  originates  from  an  altitude  with  a
temperature  of, on  average, −19°C, in  balance  with  the  net
incoming solar radiation, whereas the Earth’s surface is kept at a
much higher temperature of, on average, +14°C.

An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases leads to
an increased infrared opacity of the atmosphere, and therefore to
an effective radiation into space from a higher altitude at a lower
temperature. This causes a →radiative forcing, an imbalance that
can only be compensated for by an increase of the temperature of
the surface-troposphere system. This is the enhanced greenhouse
effect.

Greenhouse gas
Greenhouse  gases  are  those  gaseous  constituents  of  the
atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit
radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of infrared
radiation  emitted  by  the  Earth’s  surface, the  atmosphere  and
clouds.  This  property  causes  the  →greenhouse  effect.  Water
vapour  (H2O), carbon  dioxide  (CO2), nitrous  oxide  (N2O),
methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases
in  the  Earth’s  atmosphere.    Moreover  there  are  a  number  of
entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such
as the →halocarbons and other chlorine and bromine containing
substances, dealt  with  under  the  →Montreal  Protocol.  Beside
CO2, N2O  and  CH4, the  →Kyoto  Protocol  deals  with  the
greenhouse  gases  sulphur  hexafluoride  (SF6), hydrofluorocar-
bons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

Gross Primary Production (GPP)
The  amount  of  carbon  fixed  from  the  atmosphere  through
→photosynthesis.

792

Appendix I

Grounding line/zone
The  junction  between →ice  sheet  and →ice  shelf  or  the  place
where the ice starts to float. 

Halocarbons
Compounds containing either chlorine, bromine or fluorine and
carbon.  Such  compounds  can  act  as  powerful  →greenhouse
gases  in  the  atmosphere. The  chlorine  and  bromine  containing
halocarbons  are  also  involved  in  the  depletion  of  the  →ozone
layer.

leading  to  an  increase  of  cloud  →albedo.  This  effect  is  also
known as the Twomey effect. This is sometimes referred to as the
cloud albedo effect. However this is highly misleading since the
second indirect effect also alters cloud albedo.
Second indirect effect
A  radiative  forcing  induced  by  an  increase  in  anthropogenic
aerosols  which  cause  a  decrease  in  droplet  size, reducing  the
precipitation  efficiency, thereby  modifying  the  liquid  water
content, cloud thickness, and cloud life time. This effect is also
known as the cloud life time effect or Albrecht effect.

Heating degree days
The integral over a day of the temperature below 18°C (e.g. a day
with an average temperature of 16°C counts as 2 heating degree
days). See also: →Cooling degree days.

Heterotrophic respiration
The conversion of organic matter to CO2 by organisms other than
plants.

Hydrosphere
The component of the climate system comprising liquid surface
and subterranean water, such as: oceans, seas, rivers, fresh water
lakes, underground water etc. 

Ice cap
A dome shaped ice mass covering a highland area that is consid-
erably smaller in extent than an→ice sheet.

Ice sheet
A mass of land ice which is sufficiently deep to cover most of the
underlying  bedrock  topography, so  that  its  shape  is  mainly
determined  by  its  internal  dynamics  (the  flow  of  the  ice  as  it
deforms  internally  and  slides  at  its  base).   An  ice  sheet  flows
outwards from a high central plateau with a small average surface
slope.    The  margins  slope  steeply, and  the  ice  is  discharged
through fast-flowing ice streams or outlet glaciers, in some cases
into the sea or into ice-shelves floating on the sea. There are only
two  large  ice  sheets  in  the  modern  world, on  Greenland  and
Antarctica, the Antarctic  ice  sheet  being  divided  into  East  and
West  by  the  Transantarctic  Mountains;  during  glacial  periods
there were others. 

Industrial revolution
A period of rapid industrial growth with far-reaching social and
economic consequences, beginning in England during the second
half of the eighteenth century and spreading to Europe and later
to other countries including the United States. The invention of
the steam engine was an important trigger of this development.
The  industrial  revolution  marks  the  beginning  of  a  strong
increase in the use of fossil fuels and emission of, in particular,
fossil carbon dioxide. In this Report the terms pre-industrial and
industrial refer, somewhat arbitrarily, to the periods before and
after 1750, respectively.

Infrared radiation
Radiation emitted by the earth’s surface, the atmosphere and the
clouds.  It  is  also  known  as  terrestrial  or  long-wave  radiation.
Infrared  radiation  has  a  distinctive  range  of  wavelengths
(“spectrum”) longer than the wavelength of the red colour in the
visible part of the spectrum. The spectrum of infrared radiation is
practically distinct from that of →solar or short-wave radiation
because of the difference in temperature between the Sun and the
Earth-atmosphere system.

Integrated assessment
A method of analysis that combines results and models from the
physical, biological, economic  and  social  sciences, and  the
interactions  between  these  components, in  a  consistent
framework, to  evaluate  the  status  and  the  consequences  of
environmental change and the policy responses to it.

Internal variability
See: →Climate variability.

Ice shelf
A  floating  →ice  sheet  of  considerable  thickness  attached  to  a
coast  (usually  of  great  horizontal  extent  with  a  level  or  gently
undulating surface); often a seaward extension of ice sheets.

Indirect aerosol effect
→Aerosols  may  lead  to  an  indirect  →radiative  forcing  of  the
→climate  system  through  acting  as  condensation  nuclei  or
modifying  the  optical  properties  and  lifetime  of  clouds.  Two
indirect effects are distinguished:
First indirect effect
A  radiative  forcing  induced  by  an  increase  in  anthropogenic
aerosols which cause an initial increase in droplet concentration
and  a  decrease  in  droplet  size  for  fixed  liquid  water  content,

Inverse modelling
A  mathematical  procedure  by  which  the  input  to  a  model  is
estimated from the observed outcome, rather than vice versa. It
is, for  instance, used  to  estimate  the  location  and  strength  of
sources and sinks of CO2 from measurements of the distribution
of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, given models of the
global →carbon cycle and for computing atmospheric transport.

Isostatic land movements
Isostasy refers to the way in which the →lithosphere and mantle
respond  to  changes  in  surface  loads.  When  the  loading  of  the
lithosphere  is  changed  by  alterations  in  land  ice  mass, ocean
mass, sedimentation, erosion  or  mountain  building, vertical
isostatic adjustment results, in order to balance the new load.

Kyoto Protocol
The  Kyoto  Protocol  to  the  United  Nations  →Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted at the
Third  Session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  to  the
United Nations →Framework Convention on Climate Change, in
1997 in Kyoto, Japan. It contains legally binding commitments,
in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included
in Annex B of the Protocol (most OECD countries and countries
with  economies  in  transition)  agreed  to  reduce  their
anthropogenic  →greenhouse  gas  emissions  (CO2, CH4, N2O,
HFCs, PFCs, and SF6) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the
commitment period 2008 to 2012. The Kyoto Protocol has not
yet entered into force (April 2001).

Land use
The total of arrangements, activities and inputs undertaken in a
certain land cover type (a set of human actions).  The social and
economic  purposes  for  which  land  is  managed  (e.g., grazing,
timber extraction, and conservation).

Land-use change
A change in the use or management of land by humans, which
may  lead  to  a  change  in  land  cover.  Land  cover  and  land-use
change  may  have  an  impact  on  the  →albedo, →evapotrans-
piration, →sources and →sinks of →greenhouse gases, or other
properties of the →climate system and may thus have an impact
on  climate, locally  or  globally.  See  also: the  IPCC  Report  on
Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).

La Niña
See: →El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

Lifetime 
Lifetime is a general term used for various time-scales character-
ising  the  rate  of  processes  affecting  the  concentration  of  trace
gases. The following lifetimes may be distinguished:

Turnover time (T) is the ratio of the mass M of a reservoir
(e.g., a gaseous compound in the atmosphere) and the total rate
of  removal  S  from  the  reservoir: T  =  M/S.  For  each  removal
process  separate  turnover  times  can  be  defined.  In  soil  carbon
biology this is referred to as Mean Residence Time (MRT).

Adjustment  time or  response  time (Ta)  is  the  time-scale
characterising the decay of an instantaneous pulse input into the
reservoir. The term adjustment time is also used to characterise
the adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change
in  the  source  strength.  Half-life or  decay  constant is  used  to
quantify  a  first-order  exponential  decay  process.  See:
→Response time, for a different definition pertinent to climate
variations. The term lifetime is sometimes used, for simplicity, as
a surrogate for adjustment time.

In simple cases, where the global removal of the compound is
directly proportional to the total mass of the reservoir, the adjust-
ment time equals the turnover time: T = Ta. An example is CFC-
11 which is removed from the atmosphere only by photochem-
ical  processes  in  the  stratosphere.  In  more  complicated  cases,
where several reservoirs are involved or where the removal is not
proportional to the total mass, the equality T = Ta no longer holds.

→Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an extreme example. Its turnover time
is  only  about  4  years  because  of  the  rapid  exchange  between
atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a large
part of that CO2 is returned to the atmosphere within a few years.
Thus, the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere is actually
determined  by  the  rate  of  removal  of  carbon  from  the  surface
layer of the oceans into its deeper layers. Although an approxi-
mate value of 100 years may be given for the adjustment time of
CO2 in  the  atmosphere, the  actual  adjustment  is  faster  initially
and slower later on. In the case of methane (CH4) the adjustment
time is different from the turnover time, because the removal is
mainly  through  a  chemical  reaction  with  the  hydroxyl  radical
OH, the  concentration  of  which  itself  depends  on  the  CH4
concentration. Therefore the CH4 removal S is not proportional to
its total mass M. 

Lithosphere
The upper layer of the solid Earth, both continental and oceanic,
which  comprises  all  crustal  rocks  and  the  cold, mainly  elastic,
part of the uppermost mantle. Volcanic activity, although part of
the lithosphere, is not considered as part of the →climate system,
but  acts  as  an  external  forcing  factor.  See: →Isostatic  land
movements.

LOSU (Level of Scientific Understanding)
This is an index on a 4-step scale (High, Medium, Low and Very
Low)  designed  to  characterise  the  degree  of  scientific
understanding of the radiative forcing agents that affect climate
change.  For  each  agent, the  index  represents  a  subjective
judgement  about  the  reliability  of  the  estimate  of  its  forcing,
involving such factors as the assumptions necessary to evaluate
the forcing, the degree of knowledge of the physical/ chemical
mechanisms  determining  the  forcing  and  the  uncertainties
surrounding the quantitative estimate.

Mean Sea Level
See: →Relative Sea Level.

Mitigation
A  human  intervention  to  reduce  the  →sources  or  enhance  the
→sinks of →greenhouse gases.

Mixing ratio
See: →Mole fraction.

Model hierarchy
See: →Climate model.

Mole fraction
Mole fraction, or mixing ratio, is the ratio of the number of moles
of a constituent in a given volume to the total number of moles of
all constituents in that volume. It is usually reported for dry air.
Typical values for long-lived →greenhouse gases are in the order
of  µmol/mol  (parts  per  million: ppm), nmol/mol  (parts  per
billion: ppb), and fmol/mol (parts per trillion: ppt). Mole fraction
differs from volume mixing ratio, often expressed in ppmv etc.,
by  the  corrections  for  non-ideality  of  gases.  This  correction  is

794

significant  relative  to  measurement  precision  for  many
greenhouse gases. (Source: Schwartz and Warneck, 1995).

Montreal Protocol
The  Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer  was  adopted  in  Montreal  in  1987, and  subsequently
adjusted and amended in London (1990), Copenhagen (1992),
Vienna (1995), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). It controls
the  consumption  and  production  of  chlorine-  and  bromine-
containing  chemicals  that  destroy  stratospheric  ozone, such  as
CFCs, methyl  chloroform, carbon  tetrachloride, and  many
others.

Net Biome Production (NBP)
Net  gain  or  loss  of  carbon  from  a  region.  NBP  is  equal  to  the
→Net  Ecosystem  Production  minus  the  carbon  lost  due  to  a
disturbance, e.g. a forest fire or a forest harvest.

Net Ecosystem Production (NEP)
Net gain or loss of carbon from an →ecosystem. NEP is equal to
the  →Net  Primary  Production  minus  the  carbon  lost  through
→heterotrophic respiration.

Net Primary Production (NPP)
The  increase  in  plant  →biomass  or  carbon  of  a  unit  of  a
landscape.  NPP  is  equal  to  the  →Gross  Primary  Production
minus carbon lost through →autotrophic respiration.

Nitrogen fertilisation
Enhancement of plant growth through the addition of nitrogen
compounds. In IPCC Reports, this typically refers to fertilisa-
tion  from  anthropogenic  sources  of  nitrogen  such  as  human-
made  fertilisers  and  nitrogen  oxides  released  from  burning
fossil fuels.

Non-linearity
A process is called “non-linear” when there is no simple propor-
tional relation between cause and effect. The →climate system
contains many such non-linear processes, resulting in a system
with a potentially very complex behaviour. Such complexity may
lead to →rapid climate change.

North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
The North Atlantic Oscillation consists of opposing variations
of barometric pressure near Iceland and near the Azores. On
average, a  westerly  current, between  the  Icelandic  low
pressure  area  and  the  Azores  high  pressure  area, carries
cyclones  with  their  associated  frontal  systems  towards
Europe. However, the pressure difference between Iceland and
the Azores fluctuates on time-scales of days to decades, and
can be reversed at times.

Organic aerosol
→Aerosol  particles  consisting  predominantly  of  organic
compounds, mainly  C, H, O, and  lesser  amounts  of  other
elements.  (Source: Charlson  and  Heintzenberg, 1995, p.  405.)
See: →Carbonaceous aerosol.

Ozone
Ozone, the  triatomic  form  of  oxygen  (O3), is  a  gaseous
atmospheric constituent. In the →troposphere it is created both
naturally  and  by  photochemical  reactions  involving  gases
resulting  from  human  activities  (“smog”).  Tropospheric  ozone
acts as a  →greenhouse gas.  In the →stratosphere it is created by
the interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecular
oxygen  (O2).  Stratospheric  ozone  plays  a  decisive  role  in  the
stratospheric radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in the
→ozone layer. 

Ozone hole
See: →Ozone layer.

Ozone layer
The →stratosphere contains a layer in which the concentration of
ozone  is  greatest, the  so  called  ozone  layer.  The  layer  extends
from  about  12  to  40  km.  The  ozone  concentration  reaches  a
maximum  between  about  20  and  25  km.  This  layer  is  being
depleted  by  human  emissions  of  chlorine  and  bromine
compounds. Every year, during the Southern Hemisphere spring,
a very strong depletion of the ozone layer takes place over the
Antarctic  region, also  caused  by  human-made  chlorine  and
bromine compounds in combination with the specific meteoro-
logical conditions of that region. This phenomenon is called the
ozone hole.

Parametrization
In  →climate  models, this  term  refers  to  the  technique  of
representing processes, that cannot be explicitly resolved at the
spatial  or  temporal  resolution  of  the  model  (sub-grid  scale
processes), by  relationships  between  the  area  or  time  averaged
effect of such sub-grid scale processes and the larger scale flow.

Patterns of climate variability
Natural  variability  of  the  →climate  system, in  particular  on
seasonal  and  longer  time-scales, predominantly  occurs  in
preferred  spatial  patterns, through  the  dynamical  non-linear
characteristics  of  the  atmospheric  circulation  and  through
interactions  with  the  land  and  ocean  surfaces.  Such  spatial
patterns are also called “regimes” or “modes”. Examples are the
→North  Atlantic  Oscillation  (NAO), the  Pacific-North
American  pattern  (PNA), the  →El  Niño-Southern  Oscillation
(ENSO), and the Antarctic Oscillation (AO).

Photosynthesis
The  process  by  which  plants  take  CO2  from  the  air  (or
bicarbonate in water) to build carbohydrates, releasing O2 in the
process.  There  are  several  pathways  of  photosynthesis  with
different  responses  to  atmospheric  CO2 concentrations.  See:
→Carbon dioxide fertilisation.

Pool
See: →Reservoir.

Post-glacial rebound
The vertical movement of the continents and sea floor following

Appendix I

the  disappearance  and  shrinking  of →ice  sheets, e.g.  since  the
Last Glacial Maximum (21 ky BP). The rebound is an →isostatic
land movement.

Ppm, ppb, ppt
See: → Mole fraction.

Precursors
Atmospheric  compounds  which  themselves  are  not
→greenhouse gases or →aerosols, but which have an effect on
greenhouse  gas  or  aerosol  concentrations  by  taking  part  in
physical  or  chemical  processes  regulating  their  production  or
destruction rates.

Pre-industrial
See: →Industrial revolution.

Projection (generic)
A projection is a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of
quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Projections
are  distinguished  from  predictions in  order  to  emphasise  that
projections  involve  assumptions  concerning, e.g., future  socio-
economic and technological developments that may or may not
be realised, and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty.
See also →Climate projection; →Climate prediction.

Proxy
A  proxy  climate  indicator  is  a  local  record  that  is  interpreted,
using  physical  and  biophysical  principles, to  represent  some
combination of climate-related variations back in time. Climate
related  data  derived  in  this  way  are  referred  to  as  proxy  data.
Examples  of  proxies  are: tree  ring  records, characteristics  of
corals, and various data derived from ice cores.

Radiative forcing
Radiative  forcing  is  the  change  in  the  net  vertical  irradiance
(expressed  in  Watts  per  square  metre: Wm−2)  at  the
→tropopause  due  to  an  internal  change  or  a  change  in  the
external forcing of the →climate system, such as, for example,
a change in the concentration of →carbon dioxide or the output
of the Sun. Usually radiative forcing is computed after allowing
for  stratospheric  temperatures  to  readjust  to  radiative  equilib-
rium, but  with  all  tropospheric  properties  held  fixed  at  their
unperturbed values. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if
no  change  in  stratospheric  temperature  is  accounted  for.
Practical  problems  with  this  definition, in  particular  with
respect  to  radiative  forcing  associated  with  changes, by
aerosols, of the precipitation formation by clouds, are discussed
in Chapter 6 of this Report.

Radiative forcing scenario
A  plausible  representation  of  the  future  development  of
→radiative  forcing  associated, for  example, with  changes  in
atmospheric  composition  or  land-use  change, or  with  external
factors such as variations in →solar activity.  Radiative forcing
scenarios can be used as input into simplified →climate models
to compute →climate projections.

Radio-echosounding
The surface and bedrock, and hence the thickness, of a glacier
can be mapped by radar; signals penetrating the ice are reflected
at the lower boundary with rock (or water, for a floating glacier
tongue).

Rapid climate change
The →non-linearity of the →climate system may lead to rapid
climate  change, sometimes  called  abrupt  events or  even
surprises. Some such abrupt events may be imaginable, such as a
dramatic reorganisation of the →thermohaline circulation, rapid
deglaciation, or  massive  melting  of  permafrost  leading  to  fast
changes in the →carbon cycle. Others may be truly unexpected,
as a consequence of a strong, rapidly changing, forcing of a non-
linear system.

Reforestation
Planting of forests on lands that have previously contained forests
but that have been converted to some other use. For a discussion
of  the  term →forest  and  related  terms  such  as →afforestation,
reforestation, and →deforestation: see the IPCC Report on Land
Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).

Regimes
Preferred  →patterns of climate variability.

Relative Sea Level
Sea  level  measured  by  a →tide  gauge  with  respect  to  the  land
upon  which  it  is  situated.  Mean  Sea  Level  (MSL)  is  normally
defined as the average Relative Sea Level over a period, such as
a month or a year, long enough to average out transients such as
waves.

(Relative) Sea Level Secular Change
Long  term  changes  in  relative  sea  level  caused  by  either
→eustatic changes, e.g. brought about by →thermal expansion,
or changes in vertical land movements.

Reservoir
A component of the →climate system, other than the atmosphere,
which has the capacity to store, accumulate or release a substance
of  concern, e.g.  carbon, a  →greenhouse  gas  or  a  →precursor.
Oceans, soils, and →forests are examples of reservoirs of carbon.
Pool is an equivalent term (note that the definition of pool often
includes the atmosphere).  The absolute quantity of substance of
concerns, held within a reservoir at a specified time, is called the
stock.

Respiration
The process whereby living organisms convert organic matter to
CO2, releasing energy and consuming O2.

Response time
The response time or adjustment time is the time needed for the
→climate  system  or  its  components  to  re-equilibrate  to  a  new
state, following  a  forcing  resulting  from  external  and  internal
processes  or  →feedbacks.  It  is  very  different  for  various

796

Appendix I

components  of  the  climate  system.  The  response  time  of  the
→troposphere  is  relatively  short, from  days  to  weeks, whereas
the  →stratosphere  comes  into  equilibrium  on  a  time-scale  of
typically  a  few  months.  Due  to  their  large  heat  capacity, the
oceans have a much longer response time, typically decades, but
up to centuries or millennia. The response time of the strongly
coupled surface-troposphere system is, therefore, slow compared
to that of the stratosphere, and mainly determined by the oceans.
The →biosphere may respond fast, e.g. to droughts, but also very
slowly to imposed changes.

See: →Lifetime, for  a  different  definition  of  response  time
pertinent to the rate of processes affecting the concentration of
trace gases.

Scenario (generic)
A  plausible  and  often  simplified  description  of  how  the  future
may develop, based on a coherent and internally consistent set of
assumptions  about  driving  forces  and  key  relationships.
Scenarios may be derived from →projections, but are often based
on  additional  information  from  other  sources, sometimes
combined  with  a  “narrative  storyline”.  See  also: →SRES
scenarios; →Climate scenario; →Emission scenarios.

Sea level rise
See: →Relative Sea Level Secular Change; →Thermal expansion.

Sequestration
See: →Uptake.

Significant wave height
The  average  height  of  the  highest  one-third  of  all  sea  waves
occurring in a particular time period. This serves as an indicator
of the characteristic size of the highest waves.

Sink
Any  process, activity  or  mechanism  which  removes  a
→greenhouse gas, an →aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse
gas or aerosol from the atmosphere.

Soil moisture
Water  stored  in  or  at  the  land  surface  and  available  for
evaporation.

Solar activity
The Sun exhibits periods of high activity observed in numbers of
→sunspots, as  well  as  radiative  output, magnetic  activity, and
emission of high energy particles. These variations take place on
a  range  of  time-scales  from  millions  of  years  to  minutes.  See:
→Solar cycle.

Solar (“11 year”) cycle
A  quasi-regular  modulation  of  →solar  activity  with  varying
amplitude and a period of between 9 and 13 years.

Solar radiation
Radiation emitted by the Sun. It is also referred to as short-wave
radiation. Solar radiation has a distinctive range of wavelengths

(spectrum) determined by the temperature of the Sun. See also:
→Infrared radiation.

Soot particles
Particles formed during the quenching of gases at the outer edge
of  flames  of  organic  vapours, consisting  predominantly  of
carbon, with lesser amounts of oxygen and hydrogen present as
carboxyl  and  phenolic  groups  and  exhibiting  an  imperfect
graphitic  structure.  See: →Black  carbon;  Charcoal.  (Source:
Charlson and Heintzenberg, 1995, p. 406.)

Source
Any process, activity or mechanism which releases a greenhouse
gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol  into
the atmosphere. 

Spatial and temporal scales
Climate may vary on a large range of spatial and temporal scales.
Spatial  scales  may  range  from  local  (less  than  100,000  km2),
through regional (100,000 to 10 million km2) to continental (10
to 100 million km2). Temporal scales may range from seasonal to
geological (up to hundreds of millions of years).

SRES scenarios
SRES  scenarios  are  →emission  scenarios  developed  by
Nakic´enovic´ et al. (2000) and used, among others, as a basis for
the climate projections in Chapter 9 of this Report. The following
terms are relevant for a better understanding of the structure and
use of the set of SRES scenarios:
(Scenario) Family
Scenarios  that  have  a  similar  demographic, societal, economic
and technical-change storyline. Four scenario families comprise
the SRES scenario set: A1, A2, B1 and B2.
(Scenario) Group
Scenarios within a family that reflect a consistent variation of the
storyline.  The  A1  scenario  family  includes  four  groups
designated as A1T, A1C, A1G and A1B that explore alternative
structures  of  future  energy  systems.  In  the  Summary  for
Policymakers  of  Nakic´enovic´ et  al.  (2000), the A1C  and A1G
groups  have  been  combined  into  one  ‘Fossil  Intensive’ A1FI
scenario group. The other three scenario families consist of one
group each. The SRES scenario set reflected in the Summary for
Policymakers  of  Nakic´enovic´ et  al.  (2000)  thus  consist  of  six
distinct  scenario  groups, all  of  which  are  equally  sound  and
together  capture  the  range  of  uncertainties  associated  with
driving forces and emissions.
Illustrative Scenario
A scenario that is illustrative for each of the six scenario groups
reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of Nakic´enovic´ et al.
(2000).  They  include  four  revised  ‘scenario  markers’ for  the
scenario groups A1B, A2, B1, B2, and two additional scenarios
for  the A1FI  and A1T  groups. All  scenario  groups  are  equally
sound. 
(Scenario) Marker
A scenario that was originally posted in draft form on the SRES
website  to  represent  a  given  scenario  family.  The  choice  of
markers  was  based  on  which  of  the  initial  quantifications  best

Appendix I

797

reflected  the  storyline, and  the  features  of  specific  models.
Markers are no more likely than other scenarios, but are consid-
ered  by  the  SRES  writing  team  as  illustrative  of  a  particular
storyline. They are included in revised form in Nakic´enovic´ et al.
(2000). These scenarios have received the closest scrutiny of the
entire  writing  team  and  via  the  SRES  open  process.  Scenarios
have also been selected to illustrate the other two scenario groups
(see also ‘Scenario Group’ and ‘Illustrative Scenario’).
(Scenario) Storyline
A  narrative  description  of  a  scenario  (or  family  of  scenarios)
highlighting  the  main  scenario  characteristics, relationships
between key driving forces and the dynamics of their evolution.

year  70  in  a  1%  per  year  compound  CO2 increase  experiment
with a global coupled →climate model.

Tropopause
The boundary between the →troposphere and the →stratosphere.

Troposphere
The lowest part of the atmosphere from the surface to about 10
km  in  altitude  in  mid-latitudes  (ranging  from  9  km  in  high
latitudes to 16 km in the tropics on average) where clouds and
“weather” phenomena  occur.  In  the  troposphere  temperatures
generally decrease with height.

Stock
See: →Reservoir.

Turnover time
See: →Lifetime.

Storm surge
The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of
the  sea  due  to  extreme  meteorological  conditions  (low
atmospheric pressure and/or strong winds).  The storm surge is
defined  as  being  the  excess  above  the  level  expected  from  the
tidal variation alone at that time and place.

Stratosphere
The  highly  stratified  region  of  the  atmosphere  above  the
→troposphere extending from about 10 km (ranging from 9 km
in high latitudes to 16 km in the tropics on average) to about 50
km. 

Sunspots
Small dark areas on the Sun. The number of sunspots is higher
during periods of high →solar activity, and varies in particular
with the →solar cycle.

Thermal expansion
In connection with sea level, this refers to the increase in volume
(and  decrease  in  density)  that  results  from  warming  water.   A
warming of the ocean leads to an expansion of the ocean volume
and hence an increase in sea level.

Thermohaline circulation
Large-scale  density-driven  circulation  in  the  ocean, caused  by
differences in temperature and salinity. In the North Atlantic the
thermohaline circulation consists of warm surface water flowing
northward and cold deep water flowing southward, resulting in a
net poleward transport of heat. The surface water sinks in highly
restricted sinking regions located in high latitudes.

Tide gauge
A  device  at  a  coastal  location  (and  some  deep  sea  locations)
which continuously measures the level of the sea with respect to
the  adjacent  land.  Time-averaging  of  the  sea  level  so  recorded
gives the observed →Relative Sea Level Secular Changes.

Uncertainty
An  expression of the degree to which a value (e.g. the future state
of the climate system) is unknown. Uncertainty can result from
lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or
even  knowable.  It  may  have  many  types  of  sources, from
quantifiable errors in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or
terminology, or  uncertain  projections  of  human  behaviour.
Uncertainty  can  therefore  be  represented  by  quantitative
measures (e.g. a range of values calculated by various models) or
by qualitative statements (e.g., reflecting the judgement of a team
of experts). See Moss and Schneider (2000).

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCC)
The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and
signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than
150  countries  and  the  European  Community.  Its  ultimate
objective is the “stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in
the  atmosphere  at  a  level  that  would  prevent  dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. It contains
commitments  for  all  Parties.    Under  the  Convention, Parties
included in Annex I aim to return greenhouse gas emissions not
controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels by the year
2000.  The  convention  entered  into  force  in  March  1994.  See:
→Kyoto Protocol.

Uptake
The  addition  of  a  substance  of  concern  to  a  →reservoir.  The
uptake  of  carbon  containing  substances, in  particular  carbon
dioxide, is often called (carbon) sequestration.

Volume mixing ratio
See: →Mole fraction.

Appendix II

Introduction

Appendix II gives, in tabulated form, the values for emissions,
abundances  and  burdens, and, radiative  forcing  of  major
greenhouse  gases  and  aerosols  based  on  the  SRES1 scenarios
(Naki´cenovi´c et. al., 2000). The Appendix also presents global
projections  of  changes  in  surface  air  temperature  and  sea  level
using these SRES emission scenarios.

The emission values are only anthropogenic emissions and
are  the  ones  published  in  Appendix  VII  of  the  SRES  Report.
Apart from the CO2 emissions, for which deforestation and land
use values are given in the SRES Report, the SRES scenarios for
the  rest  of  the  gases  define  only  the  changes  in  direct
anthropogenic  emissions  and  do  not  specify  the  current
magnitude of the natural emissions nor the concurrent changes in
natural  emissions  due  either  to  direct  human  activities  such  as
land-use  change  or  to  the  indirect  impacts  of  climate  change.
Emissions  for  black  carbon  (BC)  aerosols  and  organic  matter
carbonaceous  (OC)  aerosols  species  not  covered  in  the  SRES
Report, are calculated by scaling to the SRES anthropogenic CO
emissions.

The  abundances  and  burdens  for  each  of  the  species  are
calculated with the latest climate chemistry and climate carbon
models (see Chapters 3, 4 and 5 for details). 

The radiative forcings due to well-mixed greenhouse gases
are computed using each of the simplified expressions given in

1 IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (Naki´cenovi´c et. al.,
2000), herafter SRES.

Chapter  6, Table  6.2.  The  radiative  forcings  associated  with
future tropospheric O3 increase are calculated on the basis of the
O3 changes  presented  in  Chapter  4  for  the  various  SRES
scenarios. The mean forcing per DU estimated from the various
models, and given in Chapter 6, Table 6.3 (i.e., 0.042 Wm−2/DU),
is used to derive these future forcings. For each aerosol species,
the ratio of the column burdens for the particular scenario to that
of  the  year  2000  is  multiplied  by  the  “best  estimate” of  the
present  day  radiative  forcing  (see  Chapter  6  for  more  details).
The  radiative  forcings  for  all  the  species  have  been  calculated
since pre-industrial time.

The  global  mean  surface  air  temperature  and  sea  level
projections, based on the SRES scenarios, have been calculated
using  Simple  Climate  models  which  have  been  “tuned” to  get
similar  responses  to  the  AOGCMs  in  the  global  mean  (see
Chapters 9 and 11 for details). 

The results presented are global mean values, every ten years
from 2000 to 2100, for a range of scenarios. These scenarios are
the  final  approved  Illustrative  Marker  Scenarios  (A1B, A1T,
A1FI, A2, B1, and B2); the preliminary marker scenarios (A1p,
A2p, B1p, B2p, approved by the IPCC Bureau in June 1998) and,
for comparison and for some species, results based on a previous
scenario used by IPCC (IS92a) have also been added. For some
gases, the  values  tabulated  in  the  IPCC  Second  Assessment
Report  (IPCC, 1996;  hereafter  SAR), for  that  IS92a  scenario
using the previous generation of chemistry and climate models,
are also given.

Note: Table II.1.4 contains supplementary data to the SRES Report (Naki´cenovi´c et. al., 2000): The data contained in the SRES Report was
insufficient to break down the individual contributions to HFCs, PFCs and SF6, these emissions were supplied by Lead Authors of the SRES
Report and are also available at the CIESIN (Center for International Earth Science Information Network) Website (http://sres.ciesin.org).
The sample scenario IS92a is only included for HFC−125, HFC−134a, and HFC−152a.
All PFCs, SF6 and HFCs emissions are the same for family A1 (A1B, A1T and A1FI).

Note: A “reference” case was defined with climate sensitivity 2.5°C, ocean uptake corresponding to the mean of the ocean model results in
Chapter 3, Figure 3.10, and terrestrial uptake corresponding to the mean of the responses of mid−range models, LPJ, IBIS and SDGM (Chapter 3,
Figure 3.10). A “low CO2” parametrization was chosen with climate sensitivity 1.5°C and maximal CO2 uptake by oceans and land. A “high CO2”
parametrization was defined with climate sensitivity 4.5°C and minimal CO2 uptake by oceans and land. See Chapter 3, Box 3.7, and Jain et al.
(1994) for more details on the ISAM model.
The IS92a column values are calculated using the ISAM parametrization noted above with IS92a emissions starting in the year 2000;  whereas the
IS92a/SAR column refers to values as reported in the SAR using IS92a emissions starting in 1990, using the SAR parametrization of ISAM.

Note: A “reference” case was defined with an average ocean uptake for the 1980s of 2.0 PgC/yr. A “low CO2” parameterisation was obtained by
combining a “fast ocean” (ocean uptake of 2.54 PgC/yr for the 1980s) and no response of heterotrophic respiration to temperature. A “high CO2”
parameterisation was obtained by combining a “slow ocean “ (ocean uptake of 1.46 PgC/yr for the 1980s) and capping CO2 fertilisation. Climate
sensitivity was set to 2.5°C for a doubling of CO2. See Chapter 3, Box 3.7 for more details on the Bern−CC model.
The IS92a/SAR column refers to values as reported in the SAR using IS92a emissions; whereas the IS92a column is calculated using IS92a
emissions but with year 2000 starting values and the BERN-CC model as described in Chapter 3. 
The Bern-CC model was initialised for observed atmospheric CO2 which was prescribed for the period 1765 to 1999. The CO2 data were
smoothed by a spline. Scenario calculations started at the begining of the year 2000. This explains the difference in the values given for the years
upto 2000. Values shown are for the beginning of each year. Annual-mean values are generally higher (up to 7ppm) depending on the scenario and
the year.

Note: Even though all PFCs, SF6 and HFCs emissions are the same for family A1 (A1B, A1T and A1FI), the OH changes due to CH4, NOx, CO and
VOC (affecting only HFCs burdens). Hence the burden for HFCs can diverge for each of these scenarios within familiy A1. See Chapter 4 for details.

Note: IS92a/SAR column refers to IS92a emissions as reported in the SAR which estimated this O3 change only as an indirect feedback effect
from CH4 increases; whereas IS92a column uses the latest models (see Chapter 4) which include also changes in emissions of NOx, CO and VOC.
A mean tropospheric O3 content of 34 DU in 1990 is adopted; and 1 ppb of tropospheric O3 = 0.65 DU.
These projected increases in troposheric O3 are likely to be 25% too large, see note to Table 4.11 of Chapter 4 describing corrections made after
government review.

the values corresponding to the year 1998 (as appropriate for the time frame when Chapter 6 began its preparation). The resulting difference in the
computed present day forcings is about 3% in the case of CO2 and about 2% in the case of CH4. For N2O, the difference in the computed forcings is
negligible. In the case of tropospheric ozone, the forcing for the year 2000 given here and that in Chapter 6 are the results of slightly different
scenarios employed which leads to about a 9% difference in the forcings. For the halogen containing compounds, the absolute differences in concen-
trations between here and Chapter 6 lead to a difference in present day forcing of less than 0.002 Wm−2 for any species.
