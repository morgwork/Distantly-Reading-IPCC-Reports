Summary  for  Policymakers

The Third Assessment Report of Working Group I of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) builds
upon past assessments and incorporates new results from the
past five years of research on climate change1. Many hundreds
of scientists2 from many countries participated in its preparation
and review.

This Summary for Policymakers (SPM), which was approved
by IPCC member governments in Shanghai in January 20013,
describes the current state of understanding of the climate
system and provides estimates of its projected future evolution
and their uncertainties. Further details can be found in the
underlying report, and the appended Source Information
provides cross references to the report's chapters.

An  increasing  body  of  observations
gives a   c o l l e c t i v e   p i c t u r e   o f   a
w a r m i n g   w o r l d   and  other  changes
in  the  climate  system.
Since the release of the Second Assessment Report (SAR4),
additional data from new studies of current and palaeoclimates,
improved analysis of data sets, more rigorous evaluation of
their quality, and comparisons among data from different
sources have led to greater understanding of climate change. 

The  global  average  surface  temperature
has  increased  over  the  20th  century  by
about  0.6°C. 

G The global average surface temperature (the average of near
surface air temperature over land, and sea surface temperature)

has increased since 1861. Over the 20th century the increase
has been 0.6 ± 0.2°C5,6 (Figure 1a). This value is about 0.15°C
larger than that estimated by the SAR for the period up to
1994, owing to the relatively high temperatures of the
additional years (1995 to 2000) and improved methods of
processing the data. These numbers take into account various
adjustments, including urban heat island effects. The record
shows a great deal of variability; for example, most of the
warming occurred during the 20th century, during two
periods, 1910 to 1945 and 1976 to 2000.

G Globally, it is very likely7 that the 1990s was the warmest

decade and 1998 the warmest year in the instrumental
record, since 1861 (see Figure 1a).

G New analyses of proxy data for the Northern Hemisphere

indicate that the increase in temperature in the 20th century
is likely7 to have been the largest of any century during the
past 1,000 years. It is also likely7 that, in the Northern
Hemisphere, the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998
the warmest year (Figure 1b). Because less data are
available, less is known about annual averages prior to
1,000 years before present and for conditions prevailing in
most of the Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.

G On average, between 1950 and 1993, night-time daily

minimum air temperatures over land increased by about
0.2°C per decade. This is about twice the rate of increase in
daytime daily maximum air temperatures (0.1°C per decade).
This has lengthened the freeze-free season in many mid- and
high latitude regions. The increase in sea surface temperature
over this period is about half that of the mean land surface
air temperature.

1 Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs 

from that in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indirectly to 
human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.

2 In total 122 Co-ordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors, 515 Contributing Authors, 21 Review Editors and 420 Expert Reviewers.
3 Delegations of 99 IPCC member countries participated in the Eighth Session of Working Group I in Shanghai on 17 to 20 January 2001. 
4 The IPCC Second Assessment Report is referred to in this Summary for Policymakers as the SAR.
5 Generally temperature trends are rounded to the nearest 0.05°C per unit time, the periods often being limited by data availability.
6 In general, a 5% statistical significance level is used, and a 95% confidence level.
7 In this Summary for Policymakers and in the Technical Summary, the following words have been used where appropriate to indicate judgmental estimates of 
confidence: virtually certain (greater than 99% chance that a result is true); very likely (90−99% chance); likely (66−90% chance); medium likelihood (33−66% 
chance); unlikely (10−33% chance); very unlikely (1−10% chance); exceptionally unlikely (less than 1% chance). The reader is referred to individual chapters 
for more details.

Figure 1: Variations of the Earth’s
surface temperature over the last
140 years and the last millennium.

(a) The Earth’s surface temperature is
shown year by year (red bars) and
approximately decade by decade (black
line, a filtered annual curve suppressing
fluctuations below near decadal 
time-scales). There are uncertainties in
the annual data (thin black whisker
bars represent the 95% confidence
range) due to data gaps, random
instrumental errors and uncertainties,
uncertainties in bias corrections in the
ocean surface temperature data and
also in adjustments for urbanisation over
the land. Over both the last 140 years
and 100 years, the best estimate is that
the global average surface temperature
has increased by 0.6 ± 0.2°C.

(b) Additionally, the year by year (blue
curve) and 50 year average (black
curve) variations of the average surface
temperature of the Northern Hemisphere
for the past 1000 years have been
reconstructed from “proxy” data
calibrated against thermometer data (see
list of the main proxy data in the
diagram). The 95% confidence range in
the annual data is represented by the
grey region. These uncertainties increase
in more distant times and are always
much larger than in the instrumental
record due to the use of relatively sparse
proxy data. Nevertheless the rate and
duration of warming of the 20th century
has been much greater than in any of
the previous nine centuries. Similarly, it
is likely7 that the 1990s have been the
warmest decade and 1998 the warmest
year of the millennium.

Temperatures  have  risen  during  the  past
four  decades  in  the  lowest  8  kilometres  of
the  atmosphere.

Global  average  sea  level  has  risen  and
ocean  heat  content  has  increased.

G Tide gauge data show that global average sea level rose

G Since the late 1950s (the period of adequate observations

between 0.1 and 0.2 metres during the 20th century.

from weather balloons), the overall global temperature
increases in the lowest 8 kilometres of the atmosphere and
in surface temperature have been similar at 0.1°C per decade.

G Since the start of the satellite record in 1979, both satellite

and weather balloon measurements show that the global
average temperature of the lowest 8 kilometres of the
atmosphere has changed by +0.05 ± 0.10°C per decade, but the
global average surface temperature has increased significantly
by +0.15 ± 0.05°C per decade. The difference in the warming
rates is statistically significant. This difference occurs
primarily over the tropical and sub-tropical regions.

G The lowest 8 kilometres of the atmosphere and the surface
are influenced differently by factors such as stratospheric
ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosols, and the El Niño
phenomenon. Hence, it is physically plausible to expect that
over a short time period (e.g., 20 years) there may be
differences in temperature trends. In addition, spatial sampling
techniques can also explain some of the differences in
trends, but these differences are not fully resolved.

Snow  cover  and  ice  extent  have  decreased.

G Satellite data show that there are very likely7 to have been
decreases of about 10% in the extent of snow cover since
the late 1960s, and ground-based observations show that
there is very likely7 to have been a reduction of about two
weeks in the annual duration of lake and river ice cover in
the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere,
over the 20th century.

G There has been a widespread retreat of mountain glaciers in

non-polar regions during the 20th century. 

G Northern Hemisphere spring and summer sea-ice extent has
decreased by about 10 to 15% since the 1950s. It is likely7
that there has been about a 40% decline in Arctic sea-ice
thickness during late summer to early autumn in recent
decades and a considerably slower decline in winter sea-ice
thickness.

4

G Global ocean heat content has increased since the late 1950s,

the period for which adequate observations of sub-surface
ocean temperatures have been available.

Changes  have  also  occurred  in  other
important  aspects  of  climate.

G It is very likely7 that precipitation has increased by 0.5 to

1% per decade in the 20th century over most mid- and
high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere continents, and
it is likely7 that rainfall has increased by 0.2 to 0.3% per
decade over the tropical (10°N to 10°S) land areas.
Increases in the tropics are not evident over the past few
decades. It is also likely7 that rainfall has decreased over
much of the Northern Hemisphere sub-tropical (10°N to
30°N) land areas during the 20th century by about 0.3%
per decade. In contrast to the Northern Hemisphere, no
comparable systematic changes have been detected in
broad latitudinal averages over the Southern Hemisphere.
There are insufficient data to establish trends in precipitation
over the oceans.

G In the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere

over the latter half of the 20th century, it is likely7 that there
has been a 2 to 4% increase in the frequency of heavy
precipitation events. Increases in heavy precipitation events
can arise from a number of causes, e.g., changes in
atmospheric moisture, thunderstorm activity and large-scale
storm activity.

G It is likely7 that there has been a 2% increase in cloud cover
over mid- to high latitude land areas during the 20th century.
In most areas the trends relate well to the observed decrease
in daily temperature range.

G Since 1950 it is very likely7 that there has been a reduction
in the frequency of extreme low temperatures, with a smaller
increase in the frequency of extreme high temperatures.

Emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  and
aerosols  due  to  human  activities
continue  to  alter  the  atmosphere  in
ways  that  are  expected  to  affect  the
climate.

Changes in climate occur as a result of both internal variability
within the climate system and external factors (both natural
and anthropogenic). The influence of external factors on
climate can be broadly compared using the concept of
radiative forcing8. A positive radiative forcing, such as that
produced by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases,
tends to warm the surface. A negative radiative forcing, which
can arise from an increase in some types of aerosols
(microscopic airborne particles) tends to cool the surface.
Natural factors, such as changes in solar output or explosive
volcanic activity, can also cause radiative forcing.
Characterisation of these climate forcing agents and their
changes over time (see Figure 2) is required to understand past
climate changes in the context of natural variations and to
project what climate changes could lie ahead. Figure 3 shows
current estimates of the radiative forcing due to increased
concentrations of atmospheric constituents and other
mechanisms.

G Warm episodes of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
phenomenon (which consistently affects regional variations
of precipitation and temperature over much of the tropics,
sub-tropics and some mid-latitude areas) have been more
frequent, persistent and intense since the mid-1970s,
compared with the previous 100 years. 

G Over the 20th century (1900 to 1995), there were relatively

small increases in global land areas experiencing severe
drought or severe wetness. In many regions, these changes
are dominated by inter-decadal and multi-decadal climate
variability, such as the shift in ENSO towards more warm
events.

G In some regions, such as parts of Asia and Africa, the

frequency and intensity of droughts have been observed to
increase in recent decades.

Some  important  aspects  of  climate  appear
not  to  have  changed.

G A few areas of the globe have not warmed in recent decades,
mainly over some parts of the Southern Hemisphere oceans
and parts of Antarctica.

G No significant trends of Antarctic sea-ice extent are apparent

since 1978, the period of reliable satellite measurements.

G Changes globally in tropical and extra-tropical storm

intensity and frequency are dominated by inter-decadal to
multi-decadal variations, with no significant trends evident
over the 20th century. Conflicting analyses make it difficult
to draw definitive conclusions about changes in storm
activity, especially in the extra-tropics.

G No systematic changes in the frequency of tornadoes, thunder
days, or hail events are evident in the limited areas analysed.

8 Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system, and 

is an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism. It is expressed in Watts per square metre (Wm−2).

Figure 2: Long records of past changes in
atmospheric composition provide the context for
the influence of anthropogenic emissions.

(a) shows changes in the atmospheric 
concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
(CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) over the past 1000
years. The ice core and firn data for several sites in
Antarctica and Greenland (shown by different
symbols) are supplemented with the data from direct
atmospheric samples over the past few decades
(shown by the line for CO2 and incorporated in the
curve representing the global average of CH4). The
estimated positive radiative forcing of the climate
system from these gases is indicated on the right-
hand scale. Since these gases have atmospheric
lifetimes of a decade or more, they are well mixed,
and their concentrations reflect emissions from
sources throughout the globe. All three records show
effects of the large and increasing growth in 
anthropogenic emissions during the Industrial Era. 

(b) illustrates the influence of industrial emissions on
atmospheric sulphate concentrations, which produce
negative radiative forcing. Shown is the time history
of the concentrations of sulphate, not in the
atmosphere but in ice cores in Greenland (shown by
lines; from which the episodic effects of volcanic
eruptions have been removed). Such data indicate
the local deposition of sulphate aerosols at the site,
reflecting sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions at 
mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. This
record, albeit more regional than that of the 
globally-mixed greenhouse gases, demonstrates the
large growth in anthropogenic SO2 emissions during
the Industrial Era. The pluses denote the relevant
regional estimated SO2 emissions (right-hand scale).

Concentrations  of  atmospheric  greenhouse
gases  and  their  radiative  forcing  have
continued  to  increase  as  a  result  of  human
activities. 

G The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has
increased by 31% since 1750. The present CO2 concentration
has not been exceeded during the past 420,000 years and
likely7 not during the past 20 million years. The current rate
of increase is unprecedented during at least the past 20,000
years.

G About three-quarters of the anthropogenic emissions of CO2

to the atmosphere during the past 20 years is due to fossil
fuel burning. The rest is predominantly due to land-use
change, especially deforestation.

G Currently the ocean and the land together are taking up
about half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. On land,
the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 very likely7 exceeded the
release of CO2 by deforestation during the 1990s.

G The rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration has

been about 1.5 ppm9 (0.4%) per year over the past two
decades. During the 1990s the year to year increase varied
from 0.9 ppm (0.2%) to 2.8 ppm (0.8%). A large part of this
variability is due to the effect of climate variability (e.g., El
Niño events) on CO2 uptake and release by land and oceans.

G The atmospheric concentration of methane (CH4) has

increased by 1060 ppb9 (151%) since 1750 and continues
to increase. The present CH4 concentration has not been
exceeded during the past 420,000 years. The annual
growth in CH4 concentration slowed and became more
variable in the 1990s, compared with the 1980s. Slightly
more than half of current CH4 emissions are anthropogenic
(e.g., use of fossil fuels, cattle, rice agriculture and
landfills). In addition, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions
have recently been identified as a cause of increasing CH4
concentration. 

G The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) has

increased by 46 ppb (17%) since 1750 and continues to
increase. The present N2O concentration has not been
exceeded during at least the past thousand years. About a
third of current N2O emissions are anthropogenic (e.g.,
agricultural soils, cattle feed lots and chemical industry). 

G Since 1995, the atmospheric concentrations of many of

those halocarbon gases that are both ozone-depleting and
greenhouse gases (e.g., CFCl3 and CF2Cl2), are either
increasing more slowly or decreasing, both in response to
reduced emissions under the regulations of the Montreal
Protocol and its Amendments. Their substitute compounds
(e.g., CHF2Cl and CF3CH2F) and some other synthetic
compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur
hexafluoride (SF6)) are also greenhouse gases, and their
concentrations are currently increasing. 

G The radiative forcing due to increases of the well-mixed
greenhouse gases from 1750 to 2000 is estimated to be 
2.43 Wm−2: 1.46 Wm−2 from CO2; 0.48 Wm−2 from CH4;
0.34 Wm−2 from the halocarbons; and 0.15 Wm−2 from N2O.
(See Figure 3, where the uncertainties are also illustrated.)

G The observed depletion of the stratospheric ozone (O3)
layer from 1979 to 2000 is estimated to have caused a
negative radiative forcing (–0.15 Wm−2). Assuming full
compliance with current halocarbon regulations, the positive
forcing of the halocarbons will be reduced as will the
magnitude of the negative forcing from stratospheric ozone
depletion as the ozone layer recovers over the 21st century.

G The total amount of O3 in the troposphere is estimated to

have increased by 36% since 1750, due primarily to 
anthropogenic emissions of several O3-forming gases. This
corresponds to a positive radiative forcing of 0.35 Wm−2. 
O3 forcing varies considerably by region and responds
much more quickly to changes in emissions than the long-
lived greenhouse gases, such as CO2.

9 ppm (parts per million) or ppb (parts per billion, 1 billion = 1,000 million) is the ratio of the number of greenhouse gas molecules to the total number of 

molecules of dry air. For example: 300 ppm means 300 molecules of a greenhouse gas per million molecules of dry air.

Figure 3: Many external factors force climate change. 

These radiative forcings arise from changes in the atmospheric composition, alteration of surface reflectance by land use, and variation in the output
of the sun. Except for solar variation, some form of human activity is linked to each. The rectangular bars represent estimates of the contributions of
these forcings − some of which yield warming, and some cooling. Forcing due to episodic volcanic events, which lead to a negative forcing lasting
only for a few years, is not shown. The indirect effect of aerosols shown is their effect on the size and number of cloud droplets. A second indirect
effect of aerosols on clouds, namely their effect on cloud lifetime, which would also lead to a negative forcing, is not shown. Effects of aviation on
greenhouse gases are included in the individual bars. The vertical line about the rectangular bars indicates a range of estimates, guided by the
spread in the published values of the forcings and physical understanding. Some of the forcings possess a much greater degree of certainty than
others. A vertical line without a rectangular bar denotes a forcing for which no best estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The overall
level of scientific understanding for each forcing varies considerably, as noted. Some of the radiative forcing agents are well mixed over the globe,
such as CO2, thereby perturbing the global heat balance. Others represent perturbations with stronger regional signatures because of their spatial
distribution, such as aerosols. For this and other reasons, a simple sum of the positive and negative bars cannot be expected to yield the net effect
on the climate system. The simulations of this assessment report (for example, Figure 5) indicate that the estimated net effect of these perturbations
is to have warmed the global climate since 1750. [Based upon Chapter 6, Figure 6.6]

Anthropogenic  aerosols  are  short-lived  and
mostly  produce  negative  radiative  forcing.

G The major sources of anthropogenic aerosols are fossil fuel

and biomass burning. These sources are also linked to
degradation of air quality and acid deposition.

G Since the SAR, significant progress has been achieved in
better characterising the direct radiative roles of different
types of aerosols. Direct radiative forcing is estimated to be
−0.4 Wm−2 for sulphate, −0.2 Wm−2 for biomass burning
aerosols, −0.1 Wm−2 for fossil fuel organic carbon and 
+0.2 Wm−2 for fossil fuel black carbon aerosols. There is
much less confidence in the ability to quantify the total
aerosol direct effect, and its evolution over time, than that
for the gases listed above. Aerosols also vary considerably
by region and respond quickly to changes in emissions.

G In addition to their direct radiative forcing, aerosols have an

indirect radiative forcing through their effects on clouds.
There is now more evidence for this indirect effect, which is
negative, although of very uncertain magnitude.

Natural  factors  have  made  small 
contributions  to  radiative  forcing  over  the
past  century.

G The radiative forcing due to changes in solar irradiance for
the period since 1750 is estimated to be about +0.3 Wm−2,
most of which occurred during the first half of the 20th
century. Since the late 1970s, satellite instruments have
observed small oscillations due to the 11-year solar cycle.
Mechanisms for the amplification of solar effects on
climate have been proposed, but currently lack a rigorous
theoretical or observational basis.

G Stratospheric aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions
lead to negative forcing, which lasts a few years. Several
major eruptions occurred in the periods 1880 to 1920 and
1960 to 1991.

G The combined change in radiative forcing of the two major

natural factors (solar variation and volcanic aerosols) is
estimated to be negative for the past two, and possibly the
past four, decades.

Confidence  in  the  ability  of  models
to  project  future  climate  has
increased. 

Complex physically-based climate models are required to
provide detailed estimates of feedbacks and of regional
features. Such models cannot yet simulate all aspects of
climate (e.g., they still cannot account fully for the observed
trend in the surface-troposphere temperature difference since
1979) and there are particular uncertainties associated with
clouds and their interaction with radiation and aerosols.
Nevertheless, confidence in the ability of these models to
provide useful projections of future climate has improved due
to their demonstrated performance on a range of space and
time-scales. 

G Understanding of climate processes and their incorporation
in climate models have improved, including water vapour,
sea-ice dynamics, and ocean heat transport.

G Some recent models produce satisfactory simulations of

current climate without the need for non-physical adjustments
of heat and water fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere interface
used in earlier models.

G Simulations that include estimates of natural and 

anthropogenic forcing reproduce the observed large-scale
changes in surface temperature over the 20th century
(Figure 4). However, contributions from some additional
processes and forcings may not have been included in the
models. Nevertheless, the large-scale consistency between
models and observations can be used to provide an
independent check on projected warming rates over the next
few decades under a given emissions scenario.

G Some aspects of model simulations of ENSO, monsoons

and the North Atlantic Oscillation, as well as selected
periods of past climate, have improved.

There  is  new  and  stronger  evidence
that  most  of  the  warming  observed
over  the  last  50  years  is  attrib-
utable  to  human  activities.

The SAR concluded: “The balance of evidence suggests a
discernible human influence on global climate”. That report
also noted that the anthropogenic signal was still emerging from
the background of natural climate variability. Since the SAR,
progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, particularly
with respect to distinguishing and quantifying the magnitude
of responses to different external influences. Although many
of the sources of uncertainty identified in the SAR still remain
to some degree, new evidence and improved understanding
support an updated conclusion.

G There is a longer and more closely scrutinised temperature

record and new model estimates of variability. The warming
over the past 100 years is very unlikely7 to be due to
internal variability alone, as estimated by current models.
Reconstructions of climate data for the past 1,000 years
(Figure 1b) also indicate that this warming was unusual and
is unlikely7 to be entirely natural in origin. 

G There are new estimates of the climate response to natural
and anthropogenic forcing, and new detection techniques
have been applied. Detection and attribution studies consis-
tently find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the
climate record of the last 35 to 50 years. 

G Simulations of the response to natural forcings alone (i.e.,
the response to variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
eruptions) do not explain the warming in the second half of
the 20th century (see for example Figure 4a). However, they
indicate that natural forcings may have contributed to the
observed warming in the first half of the 20th century. 

G The warming over the last 50 years due to anthropogenic
greenhouse gases can be identified despite uncertainties in
forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and natural
factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance). The anthropogenic
sulphate aerosol forcing, while uncertain, is negative over
this period and therefore cannot explain the warming.
Changes in natural forcing during most of this period are
also estimated to be negative and are unlikely7 to explain
the warming.

10

G Detection and attribution studies comparing model

simulated changes with the observed record can now take
into account uncertainty in the magnitude of modelled
response to external forcing, in particular that due to
uncertainty in climate sensitivity.

G Most of these studies find that, over the last 50 years, the

estimated rate and magnitude of warming due to increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases alone are comparable
with, or larger than, the observed warming. Furthermore,
most model estimates that take into account both
greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols are consistent with
observations over this period.

G The best agreement between model simulations and

observations over the last 140 years has been found when
all the above anthropogenic and natural forcing factors are
combined, as shown in Figure 4c. These results show that
the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed
changes, but do not exclude the possibility that other
forcings may also have contributed.

In the light of new evidence and taking into account the
remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over
the last 50 years is likely7 to have been due to the increase in
greenhouse gas concentrations.

Furthermore, it is very likely7 that the 20th century warming
has contributed significantly to the observed sea level rise,
through thermal expansion of sea water and widespread loss of
land ice. Within present uncertainties, observations and models
are both consistent with a lack of significant acceleration of
sea level rise during the 20th century.

Figure 4: Simulating the Earth’s temperature variations, and comparing the results to measured changes, can provide insight into the
underlying causes of the major changes. 

A climate model can be used to simulate the temperature changes that occur both from natural and anthropogenic causes. The simulations
represented by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation and volcanic activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were
done with anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases and an estimate of sulphate aerosols, and those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with
both natural and anthropogenic forcings included. From (b), it can be seen that inclusion of anthropogenic forcings provides a plausible explanation
for a substantial part of the observed temperature changes over the past century, but the best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both
natural and anthropogenic factors are included. These results show that the forcings included are sufficient to explain the observed changes, but do
not exclude the possibility that other forcings may also have contributed. The bands of model results presented here are for four runs from the same
model. Similar results to those in (b) are obtained with other models with anthropogenic forcing. [Based upon Chapter 12, Figure 12.7]

Human  influences  will  continue  to
change  atmospheric  composition
throughout  the  21st  century.

Models have been used to make projections of atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and hence of
future climate, based upon emissions scenarios from the IPCC
Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (Figure 5).
These scenarios were developed to update the IS92 series,
which were used in the SAR and are shown for comparison
here in some cases. 

Greenhouse  gases

G Emissions of CO2 due to fossil fuel burning are virtually

certain7 to be the dominant influence on the trends in
atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century.

G As the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere increases, ocean
and land will take up a decreasing fraction of anthropogenic
CO2 emissions. The net effect of land and ocean climate
feedbacks as indicated by models is to further increase
projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations, by reducing
both the ocean and land uptake of CO2.

G By 2100, carbon cycle models project atmospheric CO2

concentrations of 540 to 970 ppm for the illustrative SRES
scenarios (90 to 250% above the concentration of 280 ppm
in the year 1750), Figure 5b. These projections include the
land and ocean climate feedbacks. Uncertainties, especially
about the magnitude of the climate feedback from the
terrestrial biosphere, cause a variation of about −10 to
+30% around each scenario. The total range is 490 to 1260
ppm (75 to 350% above the 1750 concentration).

G Changing land use could influence atmospheric CO2

concentration. Hypothetically, if all of the carbon released
by historical land-use changes could be restored to the
terrestrial biosphere over the course of the century (e.g., by
reforestation), CO2 concentration would be reduced by 40
to 70 ppm.

G Model calculations of the concentrations of the non-CO2
greenhouse gases by 2100 vary considerably across the
SRES illustrative scenarios, with CH4 changing by –190 to
+1,970 ppb (present concentration 1,760 ppb), N2O changing

12

by +38 to +144 ppb (present concentration 316 ppb), total
tropospheric O3 changing by −12 to +62%, and a wide
range of changes in concentrations of HFCs, PFCs and SF6,
all relative to the year 2000. In some scenarios, total tropos-
pheric O3 would become as important a radiative forcing
agent as CH4 and, over much of the Northern Hemisphere,
would threaten the attainment of current air quality targets. 

G Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the gases that
control their concentration would be necessary to stabilise
radiative forcing. For example, for the most important
anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon cycle models indicate
that stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450,
650 or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic CO2
emissions to drop below 1990 levels, within a few decades,
about a century, or about two centuries, respectively, and
continue to decrease steadily thereafter. Eventually CO2
emissions would need to decline to a very small fraction of
current emissions. 

Aerosols

G The SRES scenarios include the possibility of either increases

or decreases in anthropogenic aerosols (e.g., sulphate
aerosols (Figure 5c), biomass aerosols, black and organic
carbon aerosols) depending on the extent of fossil fuel use
and policies to abate polluting emissions. In addition,
natural aerosols (e.g., sea salt, dust and emissions leading to
the production of sulphate and carbon aerosols) are
projected to increase as a result of changes in climate. 

Radiative  forcing  over  the  21st  century

G For the SRES illustrative scenarios, relative to the year

2000, the global mean radiative forcing due to greenhouse
gases continues to increase through the 21st century, with
the fraction due to CO2 projected to increase from slightly
more than half to about three quarters. The change in the
direct plus indirect aerosol radiative forcing is projected to
be smaller in magnitude than that of CO2. 

Global  average  temperature  and  sea
level  are  projected  to  rise  under  all
IPCC  SRES  scenarios.

In order to make projections of future climate, models
incorporate past, as well as future emissions of greenhouse
gases and aerosols. Hence, they include estimates of warming
to date and the commitment to future warming from past
emissions. 

Temperature

G The globally averaged surface temperature is projected to

increase by 1.4 to 5.8°C (Figure 5d) over the period 1990 to
2100. These results are for the full range of 35 SRES
scenarios, based on a number of climate models10,11. 

G Temperature increases are projected to be greater than those
in the SAR, which were about 1.0 to 3.5°C based on the six
IS92 scenarios. The higher projected temperatures and the
wider range are due primarily to the lower projected
sulphur dioxide emissions in the SRES scenarios relative to
the IS92 scenarios.

G The projected rate of warming is much larger than the

observed changes during the 20th century and is very likely7
to be without precedent during at least the last 10,000 years,
based on palaeoclimate data.

G By 2100, the range in the surface temperature response

across the group of climate models run with a given
scenario is comparable to the range obtained from a single
model run with the different SRES scenarios. 

G On timescales of a few decades, the current observed rate of
warming can be used to constrain the projected response to
a given emissions scenario despite uncertainty in climate
sensitivity. This approach suggests that anthropogenic

warming is likely7 to lie in the range of 0.1 to 0.2°C per
decade over the next few decades under the IS92a scenario,
similar to the corresponding range of projections of the
simple model used in Figure 5d.

G Based on recent global model simulations, it is very likely7

that nearly all land areas will warm more rapidly than the
global average, particularly those at northern high latitudes
in the cold season. Most notable of these is the warming in
the northern regions of North America, and northern and
central Asia, which exceeds global mean warming in each
model by more than 40%. In contrast, the warming is less
than the global mean change in south and southeast Asia in
summer and in southern South America in winter.

G Recent trends for surface temperature to become more 

El Niño-like in the tropical Pacific, with the eastern tropical
Pacific warming more than the western tropical Pacific,
with a corresponding eastward shift of precipitation, are
projected to continue in many models.

Precipitation

G Based on global model simulations and for a wide range of

scenarios, global average water vapour concentration and
precipitation are projected to increase during the 21st
century. By the second half of the 21st century, it is likely7
that precipitation will have increased over northern mid- to
high latitudes and Antarctica in winter. At low latitudes
there are both regional increases and decreases over land
areas. Larger year to year variations in precipitation are
very likely7 over most areas where an increase in mean
precipitation is projected.

10 Complex physically based climate models are the main tool for projecting future climate change. In order to explore the full range of scenarios, these are 

complemented by simple climate models calibrated to yield an equivalent response in temperature and sea level to complex climate models. These 
projections are obtained using a simple climate model whose climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are calibrated to each of seven complex climate 
models. The climate sensitivity used in the simple model ranges from 1.7 to 4.2°C, which is comparable to the commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C. 

11 This range does not include uncertainties in the modelling of radiative forcing, e.g. aerosol forcing uncertainties. A small carbon-cycle climate feedback 

is included.

Figure 5: The global climate of the 21st century will depend on natural changes and the response of the climate system to human activities. 

Climate models project the response of many climate variables – such as increases in global surface temperature and sea level – to various
scenarios of greenhouse gas and other human-related emissions. (a) shows the CO2 emissions of the six illustrative SRES scenarios, which are
summarised in the box on page 18, along with IS92a for comparison purposes with the SAR. (b) shows projected CO2 concentrations. (c) shows 
anthropogenic SO2 emissions. Emissions of other gases and other aerosols were included in the model but are not shown in the figure. (d) and (e)
show the projected temperature and sea level responses, respectively. The “several models all SRES envelope” in (d) and (e) shows the
temperature and sea level rise, respectively, for the simple model when tuned to a number of complex models with a range of climate sensitivities.
All SRES envelopes refer to the full range of 35 SRES scenarios. The “model average all SRES envelope” shows the average from these models
for the range of scenarios. Note that the warming and sea level rise from these emissions would continue well beyond 2100. Also note that this
range does not allow for uncertainty relating to ice dynamical changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet, nor does it account for uncertainties in
projecting non-sulphate aerosols and greenhouse gas concentrations. [Based upon (a) Chapter 3, Figure 3.12, (b) Chapter 3, Figure 3.12, (c)

Extreme  Events

Table 1 depicts an assessment of confidence in observed
changes in extremes of weather and climate during the latter
half of the 20th century (left column) and in projected changes
during the 21st century (right column)a. This assessment relies
on observational and modelling studies, as well as the physical
plausibility of future projections across all commonly-used
scenarios and is based on expert judgement7. 

G For some other extreme phenomena, many of which may
have important impacts on the environment and society,
there is currently insufficient information to assess recent
trends, and climate models currently lack the spatial detail
required to make confident projections. For example, very
small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes,
hail and lightning, are not simulated in climate models.

El  Niño

Snow  and  ice

G Confidence in projections of changes in future frequency,

G Northern Hemisphere snow cover and sea-ice extent are

projected to decrease further.

G Glaciers and ice caps are projected to continue their

widespread retreat during the 21st century. 

G The Antarctic ice sheet is likely7 to gain mass because of

greater precipitation, while the Greenland ice sheet is
likely7 to lose mass because the increase in runoff will
exceed the precipitation increase.

G Concerns have been expressed about the stability of the

West Antarctic ice sheet because it is grounded below sea
level. However, loss of grounded ice leading to substantial
sea level rise from this source is now widely agreed to be
very unlikely7 during the 21st century, although its
dynamics are still inadequately understood, especially for
projections on longer time-scales.

Sea  level

G Global mean sea level is projected to rise by 0.09 to 0.88

metres between 1990 and 2100, for the full range of
SRES scenarios. This is due primarily to thermal
expansion and loss of mass from glaciers and ice caps
(Figure 5e). The range of sea level rise presented in the
SAR was 0.13 to 0.94 metres based on the IS92
scenarios. Despite the higher temperature change
projections in this assessment, the sea level projections
are slightly lower, primarily due to the use of improved
models, which give a smaller contribution from glaciers
and ice sheets.

amplitude, and spatial pattern of El Niño events in the
tropical Pacific is tempered by some shortcomings in how
well El Niño is simulated in complex models. Current
projections show little change or a small increase in
amplitude for El Niño events over the next 100 years.

G Even with little or no change in El Niño amplitude,

global warming is likely7 to lead to greater extremes of
drying and heavy rainfall and increase the risk of
droughts and floods that occur with El Niño events in
many different regions.

Monsoons

G It is likely7 that warming associated with increasing

greenhouse gas concentrations will cause an increase of
Asian summer monsoon precipitation variability. Changes
in monsoon mean duration and strength depend on the
details of the emission scenario. The confidence in such
projections is also limited by how well the climate
models simulate the detailed seasonal evolution of the
monsoons.

Thermohaline  circulation

G Most models show weakening of the ocean thermohaline

circulation which leads to a reduction of the heat
transport into high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.
However, even in models where the thermohaline
circulation weakens, there is still a warming over Europe
due to increased greenhouse gases. The current
projections using climate models do not exhibit a
complete shut-down of the thermohaline circulation by
2100. Beyond 2100, the thermohaline circulation could
completely, and possibly irreversibly, shut-down in either
hemisphere if the change in radiative forcing is large
enough and applied long enough. 

16

Anthropogenic  climate  change  will
persist  for  many  centuries.

G Emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases (i.e., CO2, N2O,

PFCs, SF6) have a lasting effect on atmospheric
composition, radiative forcing and climate. For example,
several centuries after CO2 emissions occur, about a quarter
of the increase in CO2 concentration caused by these
emissions is still present in the atmosphere. 

G After greenhouse gas concentrations have stabilised, global
average surface temperatures would rise at a rate of only a
few tenths of a degree per century rather than several
degrees per century as projected for the 21st century
without stabilisation. The lower the level at which 
concentrations are stabilised, the smaller the total
temperature change.

G Global mean surface temperature increases and rising sea
level from thermal expansion of the ocean are projected to
continue for hundreds of years after stabilisation of
greenhouse gas concentrations (even at present levels),
owing to the long timescales on which the deep ocean
adjusts to climate change.

Further  action  is  required  to
address  remaining  gaps  in
information  and  understanding.

Further research is required to improve the ability to detect,
attribute and understand climate change, to reduce uncertainties
and to project future climate changes. In particular, there is a
need for additional systematic and sustained observations,
modelling and process studies. A serious concern is the decline
of observational networks. The following are high priority
areas for action.

G Systematic observations and reconstructions:

– Reverse the decline of observational networks in many 

parts of the world.

– Sustain and expand the observational foundation for 

climate studies by providing accurate, long-term,
consistent data including implementation of a strategy for 
integrated global observations.

– Enhance the development of reconstructions of past 

climate periods.

– Improve the observations of the spatial distribution of

contribute to sea level rise for thousands of years after
climate has been stabilised. Climate models indicate that
the local warming over Greenland is likely7 to be one to
three times the global average. Ice sheet models project that
a local warming of larger than 3°C, if sustained for
millennia, would lead to virtually a complete melting of the
Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea level rise of about
7 metres. A local warming of 5.5°C, if sustained for 1,000
years, would be likely7 to result in a contribution from
Greenland of about 3 metres to sea level rise.

G Current ice dynamic models suggest that the West Antarctic

ice sheet could contribute up to 3 metres to sea level rise
over the next 1,000 years, but such results are strongly
dependent on model assumptions regarding climate change
scenarios, ice dynamics and other factors.

G Modelling and process studies:

– Improve understanding of the mechanisms and factors 

leading to changes in radiative forcing.

– Understand and characterise the important unresolved 

processes and feedbacks, both physical and biogeo-
chemical, in the climate system.

– Improve methods to quantify uncertainties of climate 

projections and scenarios, including long-term ensemble 
simulations using complex models.

– Improve the integrated hierarchy of global and regional 

climate models with a focus on the simulation of climate 
variability, regional climate changes and extreme events.

– Link more effectively models of the physical climate and 
the biogeochemical system, and in turn improve coupling 
with descriptions of human activities.

17

Cutting across these foci are crucial needs associated with
strengthening international co-operation and co-ordination in
order to better utilise scientific, computational and observational
resources. This should also promote the free exchange of data
among scientists. A special need is to increase the observational
and research capacities in many regions, particularly in
developing countries. Finally, as is the goal of this assessment,
there is a continuing imperative to communicate research
advances in terms that are relevant to decision making.

The  Emissions  Scenarios  of  the  Special  Report  on  Emissions  Scenarios
(SRES)

A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that
peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major
underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a
substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into three groups that
describe alternative directions of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are distinguished by their
technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B) (where
balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement
rates apply to all energy supply and end use technologies).

A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and
preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously increasing
population. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological change
more fragmented and slower than other storylines.

B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same global population, that peaks in mid-
century and declines thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic structures toward a service and
information economy, with reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies.
The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but
without additional climate initiatives.

B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social
and environmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population, at a rate lower than A2,
intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1
storylines. While the scenario is also oriented towards environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and
regional levels.

An illustrative scenario was chosen for each of the six scenario groups A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1 and B2. All should be
considered equally sound.

The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly
assume implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the emissions targets of the
Kyoto Protocol.

Technical  Summar y  of  the Working  Group  I  Repor t

A. Introduction

A.1 The  IPCC  and  its Working  Groups

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
established by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)
and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in
1988. The aim was, and remains, to provide an assessment of
the understanding of all aspects of climate change1, including
how human activities can cause such changes and can be
impacted by them. It had become widely recognised that
human-influenced emissions of greenhouse gases have the
potential to alter the climate system (see Box 1), with possible
deleterious or beneficial effects. It was also recognised that
addressing such global issues required organisation on a global
scale, including assessment of the understanding of the issue
by the worldwide expert communities.

At its first session, the IPCC was organised into three Working
Groups. The current remits of the Working Groups are for
Working Group I to address the scientific aspects of the
climate system and climate change, Working Group II to
address the impacts of and adaptations to climate change, and
Working Group III to address the options for the mitigation of
climate change. The IPCC provided its first major assessment
report in 1990 and its second major assessment report in 1996.

The IPCC reports are (i) up-to-date descriptions of the knowns
and unknowns of the climate system and related factors, (ii)
based on the knowledge of the international expert
communities, (iii) produced by an open and peer-reviewed
professional process, and (iv) based upon scientific publications
whose findings are summarised in terms useful to decision
makers. While the assessed information is policy relevant, the
IPCC does not establish or advocate public policy.

The scope of the assessments of Working Group I includes
observations of the current changes and trends in the climate

system, a reconstruction of past changes and trends, an
understanding of the processes involved in those changes, and
the incorporation of this knowledge into models that can attribute
the causes of changes and that can provide simulation of natural
and human-induced future changes in the climate system.

A.2 The  First  and  Second  Assessment
Repor ts  of Working  Group  I

In the First Assessment Report in 1990, Working Group I broadly
described the status of the understanding of the climate system
and climate change that had been gained over the preceding
decades of research. Several major points were emphasised. The
greenhouse effect is a natural feature of the planet, and its
fundamental physics is well understood. The atmospheric
abundances of greenhouse gases were increasing, due largely to
human activities. Continued future growth in greenhouse gas
emissions was predicted to lead to significant increases in the
average surface temperature of the planet, increases that would
exceed the natural variation of the past several millennia and that
could be reversed only slowly. The past century had, at that time,
seen a surface warming of nearly 0.5°C, which was broadly
consistent with that predicted by climate models for the
greenhouse gas increases, but was also comparable to what was
then known about natural variation. Lastly, it was pointed out that
the current level of understanding at that time and the existing
capabilities of climate models limited the prediction of changes
in the climate of specific regions.

Based on the results of additional research and Special Reports
produced in the interim, IPCC Working Group I assessed the
new state of understanding in its Second Assessment Report
(SAR2) in 1996. The report underscored that greenhouse gas
abundances continued to increase in the atmosphere and that
very substantial cuts in emissions would be required for stabili-
sation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
(which is the ultimate goal of Article 2 of the Framework
Convention on Climate Change). Further, the general increase in

1 Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This usage 

differs from that in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or 
indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over 
comparable time periods. For a definition of scientific and technical terms: see the Glossary in Appendix I.

global temperature continued, with recent years being the
warmest since at least 1860. The ability of climate models to
simulate observed events and trends had improved, particularly
with the inclusion of sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone as
radiative forcing agents in climate models. Utilising this
simulative capability to compare to the observed patterns of
regional temperature changes, the report concluded that the
ability to quantify the human influence on global climate was
limited. The limitations arose because the expected signal was
still emerging from the noise of natural variability and because of
uncertainties in other key factors. Nevertheless, the report also
concluded that “the balance of evidence suggests a discernible
human influence on global climate”. Lastly, based on a range of
scenarios of future greenhouse gas abundances, a set of
responses of the climate system was simulated.

A.3 The Third  Assessment  Repor t: This
Technical  Summar y

The third major assessment report of IPCC Working Group I
builds upon these past assessments and incorporates the results
of the past five years of climate research. This Technical
Summary is based on the underlying information of the

Appendix. This Summary aims to describe the major features
(see Figure 1) of the understanding of the climate system and
climate change at the outset of the 21st century. Specifically:

cause climate to change, including both those that are
natural (e.g., solar variation) and human-related (e.g.,
greenhouse gases) phenomena? (Section C)

climate system to these forcing agents? In particular, how
well are key physical and biogeochemical processes
described by present global climate models? (Section D)

G Based on today’s observational data and today’s climate
predictive capabilities, what does the comparison show
regarding a human influence on today’s climate? (Section E)

G Further, using current predictive tools, what could the

possible climate future be? Namely, for a wide spectrum of
projections for several climate-forcing agents, what does
current understanding project for global temperatures,
regional patterns of precipitation, sea levels, and changes in
extremes? (Section F)

Finally, what are the most urgent research activities that
need to be addressed to improve our understanding of the
climate system and to reduce our uncertainty regarding
future climate change?

The Third Assessment Report of IPCC Working Group I is the
product of hundreds of scientists from the developed and
developing world who contributed to its preparation and
review. What follows is a summary of their understanding of
the climate system.

Box 1: What drives changes in climate?
The Earth absorbs radiation from the Sun, mainly at the surface.
This energy is then redistributed by the atmospheric and oceanic
circulations and radiated back to space at longer (infrared)
wavelengths. For the annual mean and for the Earth as a whole, the
incoming solar radiation energy is balanced approximately by the
outgoing terrestrial radiation. Any factor that alters the radiation
received from the Sun or lost to space, or that alters the redistri-
bution of energy within the atmosphere and between the atmosphere,
land, and ocean, can affect climate. A change in the net radiative
energy available to the global Earth-atmosphere system is termed
here, and in previous IPCC reports, a radiative forcing. Positive
radiative forcings tend to warm the Earth’s surface and lower
atmosphere. Negative radiative forcings tend to cool them.

Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases will reduce the
efficiency with which the Earth’s surface radiates to space. More of
the outgoing terrestrial radiation from the surface is absorbed by
the atmosphere and re-emitted at higher altitudes and lower temper-
atures. This results in a positive radiative forcing that tends to
warm the lower atmosphere and surface. Because less heat escapes
to space, this is the enhanced greenhouse effect – an enhancement
of an effect that has operated in the Earth’s atmosphere for billions
of years due to the presence of naturally occurring greenhouse
gases: water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane and nitrous
oxide. The amount of radiative forcing depends on the size of the
increase in concentration of each greenhouse gas, the radiative
properties of the gases involved, and the concentrations of other
greenhouse gases already present in the atmosphere. Further, many
greenhouse gases reside in the atmosphere for centuries after being
emitted, thereby introducing a long-term commitment to positive
radiative forcing.

Anthropogenic aerosols (microscopic airborne particles or droplets)
in the troposphere, such as those derived from fossil fuel and
biomass burning, can reflect solar radiation, which leads to a
cooling tendency in the climate system. Because it can absorb solar
radiation, black carbon (soot) aerosol tends to warm the climate
system. In addition, changes in aerosol concentrations can alter
cloud amount and cloud reflectivity through their effect on cloud
properties and lifetimes. In most cases, tropospheric aerosols tend
to produce a negative radiative forcing and a cooler climate. They
have a much shorter lifetime (days to weeks) than most greenhouse 

24

gases (decades to centuries), and, as a result, their concentrations
respond much more quickly to changes in emissions.

Volcanic activity can inject large amounts of sulphur-containing
gases (primarily sulphur dioxide) into the stratosphere, which are
transformed into sulphate aerosols. Individual eruptions can produce
a large, but transitory, negative radiative forcing, tending to cool the
Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere over periods of a few years.

The Sun’s output of energy varies by small amounts (0.1%) over
an 11-year cycle and, in addition, variations over longer periods
may occur. On time-scales of tens to thousands of years, slow
variations in the Earth’s orbit, which are well understood, have led
to changes in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar
radiation. These changes have played an important part in
controlling the variations of climate in the distant past, such as the
glacial and inter-glacial cycles.

When radiative forcing changes, the climate system responds on
various time-scales. The longest of these are due to the large heat
capacity of the deep ocean and dynamic adjustment of the ice
sheets. This means that the transient response to a change (either
positive or negative) may last for thousands of years. Any changes
in the radiative balance of the Earth, including those due to an
increase in greenhouse gases or in aerosols, will alter the global
hydrological cycle and atmospheric and oceanic circulation,
thereby affecting weather patterns and regional temperatures and
precipitation.

Any human-induced changes in climate will be embedded in a
background of natural climatic variations that occur on a whole
range of time- and space-scales. Climate variability can occur as a
result of natural changes in the forcing of the climate system, for
example variations in the strength of the incoming solar radiation
and changes in the concentrations of aerosols arising from volcanic
eruptions. Natural climate variations can also occur in the absence
of a change in external forcing, as a result of complex interactions
between components of the climate system, such as the coupling
between the atmosphere and ocean. The El Niño-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is an example of such natural
“internal” variability on interannual time-scales. To distinguish
anthropogenic climate changes from natural variations, it is
necessary to identify the anthropogenic “signal” against the
background “noise” of natural climate variability.

B. The  Obser ved  Chang es  in  the
Climate  System

Is the Earth’s climate changing? The answer is unequivocally
“Yes”. A suite of observations supports this conclusion and
provides insight about the rapidity of those changes. These
data are also the bedrock upon which to construct the answer
to the more difficult question: “Why is it changing?”, which is
addressed in later Sections.

This Section provides an updated summary of the observations
that delineate how the climate system has changed in the past.
Many of the variables of the climate system have been
measured directly, i.e., the “instrumental record”. For example,
widespread direct measurements of surface temperature began
around the middle of the 19th century. Near global
observations of other surface “weather” variables, such as
precipitation and winds, have been made for about a hundred
years. Sea level measurements have been made for over 100
years in some places, but the network of tide gauges with long
records provides only limited global coverage. Upper air
observations have been made systematically only since the late
1940s. There are also long records of surface oceanic
observations made from ships since the mid-19th century and
by dedicated buoys since about the late 1970s. Sub-surface
oceanic temperature measurements with near global coverage
are now available from the late 1940s. Since the late 1970s,
other data from Earth-observation satellites have been used to
provide a wide range of global observations of various
components of the climate system. In addition, a growing set
of palaeoclimatic data, e.g., from trees, corals, sediments, and
ice, are giving information about the Earth’s climate of
centuries and millennia before the present.

This Section places particular emphasis on current knowledge of
past changes in key climate variables: temperature, precipitation
and atmospheric moisture, snow cover, extent of land and sea
ice, sea level, patterns in atmospheric and oceanic circulation,
extreme weather and climate events, and overall features of the
climate variability. The concluding part of this Section compares
the observed trends in these various climate indicators to see if a
collective picture emerges. The degree of this internal
consistency is a critical factor in assessing the level of confidence
in the current understanding of the climate system.

B.1  Obser ved  Chang es  in Temperature

Temperatures  in  the  instrumental  record  for
land  and  oceans
The global average surface temperature has increased by 0.6
±0.2°C3 since the late 19th century. It is very likely that the
1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year in
the instrumental record since 1861 (see Figure 2). The main
cause of the increased estimate of global warming of 0.15°C
since the SAR is related to the record warmth of the additional
six years (1995 to 2000) of data. A secondary reason is related
to improved methods of estimating change. The current,
slightly larger uncertainty range (±0.2°C, 95% confidence
interval) is also more objectively based. Further, the scientific
basis for confidence in the estimates of the increase in global

1910 to 1945 and since 1976. The rate of increase of temperature
for both periods is about 0.15°C/decade. Recent warming has
been greater over land compared to oceans; the increase in sea
surface temperature over the period 1950 to 1993 is about half
that of the mean land-surface air temperature. The high global
temperature associated with the 1997 to 1998 El Niño event
stands out as an extreme event, even taking into account the
recent rate of warming.

The regional patterns of the warming that occurred in the early
part of the 20th century were different than those that occurred
in the latter part. Figure 3 shows the regional patterns of the
warming that have occurred over the full 20th century, as well
as for three component time periods. The most recent period of
warming (1976 to 1999) has been almost global, but the largest

[Based on Figure 2.7c]

increases in temperature have
occurred over the mid- and high
latitudes of the continents in the
Northern Hemisphere. Year-round
cooling is evident in the north-
western North Atlantic and the
central North Pacific Oceans, but
the North Atlantic cooling trend
has recently reversed. The recent
regional patterns of temperature
change have been shown to be
related, in part, to various phases
of atmospheric-oceanic
oscillations, such as the North
Atlantic-Arctic Oscillation and
possibly the Pacific Decadal
Oscillation. Therefore, regional
temperature trends over a few
decades can be strongly influenced
by regional variability in the
climate system and can depart

temperature since the late 19th century has been strengthened
since the SAR. This is due to the improvements derived from
several new studies. These include an independent test of the
corrections used for time-dependent biases in the sea surface
temperature data and new analyses of the effect of urban “heat
island” influences on global land-temperature trends. As
indicated in Figure 2, most of the increase in global temperature
since the late 19th century has occurred in two distinct periods:

appreciably from a global average. The 1910 to 1945 warming
was initially concentrated in the North Atlantic. By contrast, the
period 1946 to 1975 showed significant cooling in the North
Atlantic, as well as much of the Northern Hemisphere, and
warming in much of the Southern Hemisphere. 

New analyses indicate that global ocean heat content has
increased significantly since the late 1950s. More than half
of the increase in heat content has occurred in the upper 300 m

the area of the circle with red representing increases, blue representing decreases, and green little or no change. Trends were calculated from annually
averaged gridded anomalies with the requirement that the calculation of annual anomalies include a minimum of 10 months of data. For the period 1901
to 1999, trends were calculated only for those grid boxes containing annual anomalies in at least 66 of the 100 years. The minimum number of years
required for the shorter time periods (1910 to 1945, 1946 to 1975, and 1976 to 1999) was 24, 20, and 16 years respectively. [Based on Figure 2.9]

of the ocean, equivalent to a rate of temperature increase in
this layer of about 0.04°C/decade.

New analyses of daily maximum and minimum land-surface
temperatures for 1950 to 1993 continue to show that this
measure of diurnal temperature range is decreasing very
widely, although not everywhere. On average, minimum
temperatures are increasing at about twice the rate of
maximum temperatures (0.2 versus 0.1°C/decade).

Temperatures  above  the  surface  layer  from
satellite  and  weather  balloon  records
Surface, balloon and satellite temperature measurements show
that the troposphere and Earth’s surface have warmed and
that the stratosphere has cooled. Over the shorter time period
for which there have been both satellite and weather balloon
data (since 1979), the balloon and satellite records show
significantly less lower-tropospheric warming than observed
at the surface. Analyses of temperature trends since 1958 for
the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere and at the surface are in

27

good agreement, as shown in Figure 4a, with a warming of
about 0.1°C per decade. However, since the beginning of the
satellite record in 1979, the temperature data from both
satellites and weather balloons show a warming in the global
middle-to-lower troposphere at a rate of approximately 0.05 ±
0.10°C per decade. The global average surface temperature has
increased significantly by 0.15 ± 0.05°C/decade. The
difference in the warming rates is statistically significant. By
contrast, during the period 1958 to 1978, surface temperature
trends were near zero, while trends for the lowest 8 km of the
atmosphere were near 0.2°C/decade. About half of the
observed difference in warming since 1979 is likely4 to be due
to the combination of the differences in spatial coverage of the
surface and tropospheric observations and the physical effects
of the sequence of volcanic eruptions and a substantial El
Niño (see Box 4 for a general description of ENSO) that
occurred within this period. The remaining difference is very
likely real and not an observing bias. It arises primarily due to
differences in the rate of temperature change over the tropical
and sub-tropical regions, which were faster in the lowest 8 km
of the atmosphere before about 1979, but which have been
slower since then. There are no significant differences in
warming rates over mid-latitude continental regions in the
Northern Hemisphere. In the upper troposphere, no significant
global temperature trends have been detected since the early
1960s. In the stratosphere, as shown in Figure 4b, both
satellites and balloons show substantial cooling, punctuated by
sharp warming episodes of one to two years long that are due
to volcanic eruptions.

Surface  temperatures  during  the  pre-
instrumental  period  from  the  proxy  record
It is likely that the rate and duration of the warming of the 20th
century is larger than any other time during the last 1,000
years. The 1990s are likely to have been the warmest decade of
the millennium in the Northern Hemisphere, and 1998 is likely
to have been the warmest year. There has been a considerable
advance in understanding of temperature change that occurred
over the last millennium, especially from the synthesis of
individual temperature reconstructions. This new detailed
temperature record for the Northern Hemisphere is shown in

Figure 5. The data show a relatively warm period associated
with the 11th to 14th centuries and a relatively cool period
associated with the 15th to 19th centuries in the Northern
Hemisphere. However, evidence does not support these
“Medieval Warm Period” and “Little Ice Age” periods, respec-
tively, as being globally synchronous. As Figure 5 indicates, the
rate and duration of warming of the Northern Hemisphere in
the 20th century appears to have been unprecedented during the
millennium, and it cannot simply be considered as a recovery
from the “Little Ice Age” of the 15th to 19th centuries. These
analyses are complemented by sensitivity analysis of the spatial
representativeness of available palaeoclimatic data, indicating
that the warmth of the recent decade is outside the 95%
confidence interval of temperature uncertainty, even during the
warmest periods of the last millennium. Moreover, several
different analyses have now been completed, each suggesting

Figure 2.20]

that the Northern Hemisphere temperatures of the past decade
have been warmer than any other time in the past six to ten
centuries. This is the time-span over which temperatures with
annual resolution can be calculated using hemispheric-wide
tree-ring, ice-cores, corals, and and other annually-resolved
proxy data. Because less data are available, less is known about
annual averages prior to 1,000 years before the present and for
conditions prevailing in most of the Southern Hemisphere prior
to 1861.

It is likely that large rapid decadal temperature changes occurred
during the last glacial and its deglaciation (between about
100,000 and 10,000 years ago), particularly in high latitudes of
the Northern Hemisphere. In a few places during the
deglaciation, local increases in temperature of 5 to 10°C are
likely to have occurred over periods as short as a few decades.
During the last 10,000 years, there is emerging evidence of
significant rapid regional temperature changes, which are part of
the natural variability of climate.

B.2  Obser ved  Chang es  in  Precipitation  and
Atmospheric  Moisture

B.3  Obser ved  Chang es  in  Snow  Cover  and
Land-  and  Sea-Ice  Extent

Decreasing snow cover and land-ice extent continue to be
positively correlated with increasing land-surface temper-
atures. Satellite data show that there are very likely to have
been decreases of about 10% in the extent of snow cover
since the late 1960s. There is a highly significant correlation
between increases in Northern Hemisphere land temper-
atures and the decreases. There is now ample evidence to
support a major retreat of alpine and continental glaciers in
response to 20th century warming. In a few maritime
regions, increases in precipitation due to regional
atmospheric circulation changes have overshadowed
increases in temperature in the past two decades, and
glaciers have re-advanced. Over the past 100 to 150 years,
ground-based observations show that there is very likely to
have been a reduction of about two weeks in the annual
duration of lake and river ice in the mid- to high latitudes of
the Northern Hemisphere.

Northern Hemisphere sea-ice amounts are decreasing, but
no significant trends in Antarctic sea-ice extent are
apparent. A retreat of sea-ice extent in the Arctic spring and
summer of 10 to 15% since the 1950s is consistent with an
increase in spring temperatures and, to a lesser extent,
summer temperatures in the high latitudes. There is little
indication of reduced Arctic sea-ice extent during winter
when temperatures have increased in the surrounding region.
By contrast, there is no readily apparent relationship
between decadal changes of Antarctic temperatures and 
sea-ice extent since 1973. After an initial decrease in the
mid-1970s, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained stable, or
even slightly increased. 

New data indicate that there likely has been an approxi-
mately 40% decline in Arctic sea-ice thickness in late
summer to early autumn between the period of 1958 to 1976
and the mid-1990s, and a substantially smaller decline in
winter. The relatively short record length and incomplete
sampling limit the interpretation of these data. Interannual
variability and inter-decadal variability could be influencing
these changes.

Since the time of the SAR, annual land precipitation has
continued to increase in the middle and high latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere (very likely to be 0.5 to 1%/decade), except
over Eastern Asia. Over the sub-tropics (10°N to 30°N), land-
surface rainfall has decreased on average (likely to be about
0.3%/decade), although this has shown signs of recovery in recent
years. Tropical land-surface precipitation measurements indicate
that precipitation likely has increased by about 0.2 to 0.3%/
decade over the 20th century, but increases are not evident over
the past few decades and the amount of tropical land (versus
ocean) area for the latitudes 10°N to 10°S is relatively small.
Nonetheless, direct measurements of precipitation and model
reanalyses of inferred precipitation indicate that rainfall has also
increased over large parts of the tropical oceans. Where and when
available, changes in annual streamflow often relate well to
changes in total precipitation. The increases in precipitation over
Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitude land areas have a
strong correlation to long-term increases in total cloud amount. In
contrast to the Northern Hemisphere, no comparable systematic
changes in precipitation have been detected in broad latitudinal
averages over the Southern Hemisphere.

It is likely that total atmospheric water vapour has increased
several per cent per decade over many regions of the Northern
Hemisphere. Changes in water vapour over approximately the
past 25 years have been analysed for selected regions using in situ
surface observations, as well as lower-tropospheric measurements
from satellites and weather balloons. A pattern of overall surface
and lower-tropospheric water vapour increases over the past few
decades is emerging from the most reliable data sets, although
there are likely to be time-dependent biases in these data and
regional variations in the trends. Water vapour in the lower strato-
sphere is also likely to have increased by about 10% per decade
since the beginning of the observational record (1980).

Changes in total cloud amounts over Northern Hemisphere 
mid- and high latitude continental regions indicate a likely
increase in cloud cover of about 2% since the beginning of the
20th century, which has now been shown to be positively
correlated with decreases in the diurnal temperature range.
Similar changes have been shown over Australia, the only
Southern Hemisphere continent where such an analysis has been
completed. Changes in total cloud amount are uncertain both over
sub-tropical and tropical land areas, as well as over the oceans.

B.4  Obser ved  Chang es  in  Sea  Level

Chang es  during  the  instrumental  record
Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global mean sea level rise
during the 20th century is in the range 1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr, with a
central value of 1.5 mm/yr (the central value should not be
interpreted as a best estimate). (See Box 2 for the factors that
influence sea level.) As Figure 6 indicates, the longest instrumental
records (two or three centuries at most) of local sea level come
from tide gauges. Based on the very few long tide-gauge records,
the average rate of sea level rise has been larger during the 20th
century than during the 19th century. No significant acceleration

in the rate of sea level rise during the 20th century has been
detected. This is not inconsistent with model results due to the
possibility of compensating factors and the limited data.

Chang es  during  the  pre-instrumental  record
Since the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, the
sea level in locations far from present and former ice sheets
has risen by over 120 m as a result of loss of mass from these
ice sheets. Vertical land movements, both upward and
downward, are still occurring in response to these large
transfers of mass from ice sheets to oceans. The most rapid
rise in global sea level was between 15,000 and 6,000 years

Box 2: What causes sea level to
change?
The level of the sea at the shoreline is
determined by many factors in the
global environment that operate on a
great range of time-scales, from hours
(tidal) to millions of years (ocean
basin changes due to tectonics and
sedimentation). On the time-scale of
decades to centuries, some of the
largest influences on the average
levels of the sea are linked to climate
and climate change processes.

Firstly, as ocean water warms, it
expands. On the basis of observations
of ocean temperatures and model
results, thermal expansion is believed
to be one of the major contributors to
historical sea level changes. Further,
thermal expansion is expected to
contribute the largest component to
sea level rise over the next hundred
years. Deep ocean temperatures
change only slowly; therefore, thermal
expansion would continue for many
centuries even if the atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases
were to stabilise. 

The amount of warming and the depth
of water affected vary with location.
In addition, warmer water expands

more than colder water for a given
change in temperature. The
geographical distribution of sea level
change results from the geographical
variation of thermal expansion,
changes in salinity, winds, and ocean
circulation. The range of regional
variation is substantial compared with
the global average sea level rise.

Sea level also changes when the mass
of water in the ocean increases or
decreases. This occurs when ocean
water is exchanged with the water
stored on land. The major land store is
the water frozen in glaciers or ice
sheets. Indeed, the main reason for the
lower sea level during the last glacial
period was the amount of water stored
in the large extension of the ice sheets
on the continents of the Northern
Hemisphere. After thermal expansion,
the melting of mountain glaciers and
ice caps is expected to make the
largest contribution to the rise of sea
level over the next hundred years.
These glaciers and ice caps make up
only a few per cent of the world’s
land-ice area, but they are more
sensitive to climate change than the
larger ice sheets in Greenland and
Antarctica, because the ice sheets are
in colder climates with low precipitation

and low melting rates. Consequently,
the large ice sheets are expected to
make only a small net contribution to
sea level change in the coming
decades.

Sea level is also influenced by
processes that are not explicitly
related to climate change. Terrestrial
water storage (and hence, sea level)
can be altered by extraction of ground
water, building of reservoirs, changes
in surface runoff, and seepage into
deep aquifers from reservoirs and
irrigation. These factors may be
offsetting a significant fraction of the
expected acceleration in sea level rise
from thermal expansion and glacial
melting. In addition, coastal
subsidence in river delta regions can
also influence local sea level. Vertical
land movements caused by natural
geological processes, such as slow
movements in the Earth’s mantle and
tectonic displacements of the crust,
can have effects on local sea level that
are comparable to climate-related
impacts. Lastly, on seasonal,
interannual, and decadal time-scales,
sea level responds to changes in
atmospheric and ocean dynamics, with
the most striking example occurring
during El Niño events.

31

ago, with an average rate of about 10 mm/yr. Based on
geological data, eustatic sea level (i.e., corresponding to a
change in ocean volume) may have risen at an average rate
of 0.5 mm/yr over the past 6,000 years and at an average rate
of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr over the last 3,000 years. This rate is
about one tenth of that occurring during the 20th century.
Over the past 3,000 to 5,000 years, oscillations in global sea
level on time-scales of 100 to 1,000 years are unlikely to
have exceeded 0.3 to 0.5 m.

B.5  Obser ved  Chang es  in  Atmospheric  and
Oceanic  Circulation  Patterns

The behaviour of ENSO (see Box 4 for a general description),
has been unusual since the mid-1970s compared with the
previous 100 years, with warm phase ENSO episodes being
relatively more frequent, persistent, and intense than the
opposite cool phase. This recent behaviour of ENSO is
reflected in variations in precipitation and temperature over
much of the global tropics and sub-tropics. The overall effect

is likely to have been a small contribution to the increase in
global temperatures during the last few decades. The 
Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal
Oscillation are associated with decadal to multidecadal
climate variability over the Pacific basin. It is likely that these
oscillations modulate ENSO-related climate variability.

Other important circulation features that affect the climate
in large regions of the globe are being characterised. The
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is linked to the strength of
the westerlies over the Atlantic and extra-tropical Eurasia.
During winter the NAO displays irregular oscillations on
interannual to multi-decadal time-scales. Since the 1970s,
the winter NAO has often been in a phase that contributes to
stronger westerlies, which correlate with cold season
warming over Eurasia. New evidence indicates that the NAO
and changes in Arctic sea ice are likely to be closely
coupled. The NAO is now believed to be part of a wider
scale atmospheric Arctic Oscillation that affects much of the
extratropical Northern Hemisphere. A similar Antarctic
Oscillation has been in an enhanced positive phase during
the last 15 years, with stronger westerlies over the Southern
Oceans.

B.6  Obser ved  Chang es  in  Climate
Variability  and  Extreme Weather  and
Climate  Events

New analyses show that in regions where total precipitation
has increased, it is very likely that there have been even more
pronounced increases in heavy and extreme precipitation
events. The converse is also true. In some regions, however,
heavy and extreme events (i.e., defined to be within the
upper or lower ten percentiles) have increased despite the
fact that total precipitation has decreased or remained
constant. This is attributed to a decrease in the frequency of
precipitation events. Overall, it is likely that for many mid-
and high latitude areas, primarily in the Northern
Hemisphere, statistically significant increases have occurred
in the proportion of total annual precipitation derived from
heavy and extreme precipitation events; it is likely that there
has been a 2 to 4% increase in the frequency of heavy
precipitation events over the latter half of the 20th century.
Over the 20th century (1900 to 1995), there were relatively
small increases in global land areas experiencing severe
drought or severe wetness. In some regions, such as parts of

Asia and Africa, the frequency and intensity of drought have
been observed to increase in recent decades. In many
regions, these changes are dominated by inter-decadal and
multi-decadal climate variability, such as the shift in ENSO
towards more warm events. In many regions, inter-daily
temperature variability has decreased, and increases in the
daily minimum temperature are lengthening the freeze-free
period in most mid- and high latitude regions. Since 1950 it
is very likely that there has been a significant reduction in
the frequency of much-below-normal seasonal mean temper-
atures across much of the globe, but there has been a smaller
increase in the frequency of much-above-normal seasonal
temperatures.

There is no compelling evidence to indicate that the 
characteristics of tropical and extratropical storms have
changed. Changes in tropical storm intensity and frequency
are dominated by interdecadal to multidecadal variations,
which may be substantial, e.g., in the tropical North Atlantic.
Owing to incomplete data and limited and conflicting
analyses, it is uncertain as to whether there have been any
long-term and large-scale increases in the intensity and
frequency of extra-tropical cyclones in the Northern
Hemisphere. Regional increases have been identified in the
North Pacific, parts of North America, and Europe over the
past several decades. In the Southern Hemisphere, fewer
analyses have been completed, but they suggest a decrease in
extra-tropical cyclone activity since the 1970s. Recent
analyses of changes in severe local weather (e.g., tornadoes,
thunderstorm days, and hail) in a few selected regions do not
provide compelling evidence to suggest long-term changes.
In general, trends in severe weather events are notoriously
difficult to detect because of their relatively rare occurrence
and large spatial variability.

B.7 The Collective Picture: A Warming World
and Other Changes in the Climate System

As summarised above, a suite of climate changes is now 
well-documented, particularly over the recent decades to
century time period, with its growing set of direct
measurements. Figure 7 illustrates these trends in temperature
indicators (Figure 7a) and hydrological and storm-related
indicators (Figure 7b), as well as also providing an indication
of certainty about the changes.

33

Taken together, these trends illustrate a collective picture
of a warming world:
G Surface temperature measurements over the land and

Some important aspects of climate appear not to have
changed.
G A few areas of the globe have not warmed in recent

decades, mainly over some parts of the Southern Hemisphere
oceans and parts of Antarctica.

G No significant trends in Antarctic sea-ice extent are apparent
over the period of systematic satellite measurements (since
1978).

G Based on limited data, the observed variations in the
intensity and frequency of tropical and extra-tropical
cyclones and severe local storms show no clear trends in the
last half of the 20th century, although multi-decadal fluctu-
ations are sometimes apparent.

The variations and trends in the examined indicators imply
that it is virtually certain that there has been a generally
increasing trend in global surface temperature over the 20th
century, although short-term and regional deviations from this
trend occur.

oceans (with two separate estimates over the latter) have
been measured and adjusted independently. All data sets
show quite similar upward trends globally, with two major
warming periods globally: 1910 to 1945 and since 1976.
There is an emerging tendency for global land-surface air
temperatures to warm faster than the global ocean-surface
temperatures.

G Weather balloon measurements show that lower-tropospheric
temperatures have been increasing since 1958, though only
slightly since 1979. Since 1979, satellite data are available
and show similar trends to balloon data.

G The decrease in the continental diurnal temperature range

coincides with increases in cloud amount, precipitation, and
increases in total water vapour.

G The nearly worldwide decrease in mountain glacier extent

and ice mass is consistent with worldwide surface
temperature increases. A few recent exceptions in coastal
regions are consistent with atmospheric circulation
variations and related precipitation increases.

G The decreases in snow cover and the shortening seasons of

lake and river ice relate well to increases in Northern
Hemispheric land-surface temperatures.

G The systematic decrease in spring and summer sea-ice

extent and thickness in the Arctic is consistent with
increases in temperature over most of the adjacent land and
ocean.

G Ocean heat content has increased, and global average sea

level has risen.

G The increases in total tropospheric water vapour in the last

25 years are qualitatively consistent with increases in
tropospheric temperatures and an enhanced hydrologic
cycle, resulting in more extreme and heavier precipitation
events in many areas with increasing precipitation, e.g.,
middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

C. The  Forcing  Ag ents That  Cause
Climate  Chang e

In addition to the past variations and changes in the Earth’s
climate, observations have also documented the changes that
have occurred in agents that can cause climate change. Most
notable among these are increases in the atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols (microscopic
airborne particles or droplets) and variations in solar activity,
both of which can alter the Earth’s radiation budget and hence
climate. These observational records of climate-forcing agents
are part of the input needed to understand the past climate
changes noted in the preceding Section and, very importantly,
to predict what climate changes could lie ahead (see Section F).

Like the record of past climate changes, the data sets for forcing
agents are of varying length and quality. Direct measurements of
solar irradiance exist for only about two decades. The sustained
direct monitoring of the atmospheric concentrations of carbon
dioxide (CO2) began about the middle of the 20th century and,
in later years, for other long-lived, well-mixed gases such as
methane. Palaeo-atmospheric data from ice cores reveal the
concentration changes occurring in earlier millennia for some
greenhouse gases. In contrast, the time-series measurements for
the forcing agents that have relatively short residence times in
the atmosphere (e.g., aerosols) are more recent and are far less
complete, because they are harder to measure and are spatially
heterogeneous. Current data sets show the human influence on
atmospheric concentrations of both the long-lived greenhouse
gases and short-lived forcing agents during the last part of the
past millennium. Figure 8 illustrates the effects of the large
growth over the Industrial Era in the anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases and sulphur dioxide, the latter being a
precursor of aerosols.

A change in the energy available to the global Earth-atmosphere
system due to changes in these forcing agents is termed
radiative forcing (Wm−2) of the climate system (see Box 1).
Defined in this manner, radiative forcing of climate change
constitutes an index of the relative global mean impacts on the
surface-troposphere system due to different natural and 
anthropogenic causes. This Section updates the knowledge of
the radiative forcing of climate change that has occurred from
pre-industrial times to the present. Figure 9 shows the estimated
radiative forcings from the beginning of the Industrial Era
(1750) to 1999 for the quantifiable natural and anthropogenic

Level  of Scientific Understanding

Figure 9: Global, annual-mean radiative forcings (Wm−2) due to a number of agents for the period from pre-industrial (1750) to present (late 1990s;
about 2000) (numerical values are also listed in Table 6.11 of Chapter 6). For detailed explanations, see Chapter 6.13. The height of the rectangular
bar denotes a central or best estimate value, while its absence denotes no best estimate is possible. The vertical line about the rectangular bar with “x”
delimiters indicates an estimate of the uncertainty range, for the most part guided by the spread in the published values of the forcing. A vertical line
without a rectangular bar and with “o” delimiters denotes a forcing for which no central estimate can be given owing to large uncertainties. The
uncertainty range specified here has no statistical basis and therefore differs from the use of the term elsewhere in this document. A “level of scientific
understanding” index is accorded to each forcing, with high, medium, low and very low levels, respectively. This represents the subjective judgement
about the reliability of the forcing estimate, involving factors such as the assumptions necessary to evaluate the forcing, the degree of knowledge of
the physical/chemical mechanisms determining the forcing, and the uncertainties surrounding the quantitative estimate of the forcing (see Table 6.12).
The well-mixed greenhouse gases are grouped together into a single rectangular bar with the individual mean contributions due to CO2, CH4, N2O and
halocarbons shown (see Tables 6.1 and 6.11). Fossil fuel burning is separated into the “black carbon” and “organic carbon” components with its
separate best estimate and range. The sign of the effects due to mineral dust is itself an uncertainty. The indirect forcing due to tropospheric aerosols
is poorly understood. The same is true for the forcing due to aviation via its effects on contrails and cirrus clouds. Only the “first” type of indirect effect
due to aerosols as applicable in the context of liquid clouds is considered here. The “second” type of effect is conceptually important, but there exists
very little confidence in the simulated quantitative estimates. The forcing associated with stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions is highly
variable over the period and is not considered for this plot (however, see Figure 6.8). All the forcings shown have distinct spatial and seasonal features
(Figure 6.7) such that the global, annual means appearing on this plot do not yield a complete picture of the radiative perturbation. They are only
intended to give, in a relative sense, a first-order perspective on a global, annual mean scale and cannot be readily employed to obtain the climate
response to the total natural and/or anthropogenic forcings. As in the SAR, it is emphasised that the positive and negative global mean forcings cannot
be added up and viewed a priori as providing offsets in terms of the complete global climate impact. [Based on Figure 6.6]

forcing agents. Although not included in the figure due to their
episodic nature, volcanic eruptions are the source of another
important natural forcing. Summaries of the information about
each forcing agent follow in the sub-sections below.

The forcing agents included in Figure 9 vary greatly in their
form, magnitude and spatial distribution. Some of the
greenhouse gases are emitted directly into the atmosphere;
some are chemical products from other emissions. Some
greenhouse gases have long atmospheric residence times and,
as a result, are well-mixed throughout the atmosphere.
Others are short-lived and have heterogeneous regional 
concentrations. Most of the gases originate from both natural
and anthropogenic sources. Lastly, as shown in Figure 9, the
radiative forcings of individual agents can be positive (i.e., a
tendency to warm the Earth’s surface) or negative (i.e., a
tendency to cool the Earth’s surface).

C.1  Obser ved  Chang es  in  Globally Well-
Mixed  Greenhouse  Gas  Concentrations  and
Radiative  Forcing

Over the millennium before the Industrial Era, the atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases remained relatively
constant. Since then, however, the concentrations of many
greenhouse gases have increased directly or indirectly
because of human activities. 

Table 1 provides examples of several greenhouse gases and
summarises their 1750 and 1998 concentrations, their
change during the 1990s, and their atmospheric lifetimes.
The contribution of a species to radiative forcing of climate
change depends on the molecular radiative properties of the
gas, the size of the increase in atmospheric concentration,
and the residence time of the species in the atmosphere,
once emitted. The latter – the atmospheric residence time of
the greenhouse gas – is a highly policy relevant characteristic.
Namely, emissions of a greenhouse gas that has a long
atmospheric residence time is a quasi-irreversible
commitment to sustained radiative forcing over decades,
centuries, or millennia, before natural processes can remove
the quantities emitted.

Carbon  dioxide  (CO 2)
The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased from
280 ppm5 in 1750 to 367 ppm in 1999 (31%, Table 1).
Today’s CO2 concentration has not been exceeded during the
past 420,000 years and likely not during the past 20 million
years. The rate of increase over the past century is unprece-
dented, at least during the past 20,000 years (Figure 10).
The CO2 isotopic composition and the observed decrease in
Oxygen (O2) demonstrates that the observed increase in CO2
is predominately due to the oxidation of organic carbon by
fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation. An expanding set
of palaeo-atmospheric data from air trapped in ice over
hundreds of millennia provide a context for the increase in
CO2 concentrations during the Industrial Era (Figure 10).
Compared to the relatively stable CO2 concentrations (280 ±
10 ppm) of the preceding several thousand years, the
increase during the Industrial Era is dramatic. The average
rate of increase since 1980 is 0.4%/yr. The increase is a
consequence of CO2 emissions. Most of the emissions
during the past 20 years are due to fossil fuel burning, the
rest (10 to 30%) is predominantly due to land-use change,
especially deforestation. As shown in Figure 9, CO2 is the
dominant human-influenced greenhouse gas, with a current
radiative forcing of 1.46 Wm−2, being 60% of the total from
the changes in concentrations of all of the long-lived and
globally mixed greenhouse gases.

Direct atmospheric measurements of CO2 concentrations made
over the past 40 years show that year to year fluctuations in the
rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 are large. In the 1990s, the
annual rates of CO2 increase in the atmosphere varied from 0.9
to 2.8 ppm/yr, equivalent to 1.9 to 6.0 PgC/yr. Such annual
changes can be related statistically to short-term climate
variability, which alters the rate at which atmospheric CO2 is
taken up and released by the oceans and land. The highest rates
of increase in atmospheric CO2 have typically been in strong El
Niño years (Box 4). These higher rates of increase can be
plausibly explained by reduced terrestrial uptake (or terrestrial
outgassing) of CO2 during El Niño years, overwhelming the
tendency of the ocean to take up more CO2 than usual.
Partitioning of anthropogenic CO2 between atmospheric
increases and land and ocean uptake for the past two decades
can now be calculated from atmospheric observations. Table
2 presents a global CO2 budget for the 1980s (which proves to
be similar to the one constructed with the help of ocean
model results in the SAR) and for the 1990s. Measurements
of the decrease in atmospheric oxygen (O2) as well as the
increase in CO2 were used in the construction of these new
budgets. Results from this approach are consistent with other
analyses based on the isotopic composition of atmospheric
CO2 and with independent estimates based on measurements
of CO2 and 13CO2 in seawater. The 1990s budget is based on
newly available measurements and updates the budget for

c The fossil fuel emissions term for the 1980s has been revised slightly downward since the SAR.
d The land-atmosphere flux represents the balance of a positive term due to land-use change and a residual terrestrial sink. The two terms cannot be
separated on the basis of current atmospheric measurements. Using independent analyses to estimate the land-use change component for 1980 to
1989, the residual terrestrial sink can be inferred as follows: Land-use change 1.7 PgC/yr (0.6 to 2.5); Residual terrestrial sink −1.9 PgC/yr (−3.8 to
0.3). Comparable data for the 1990s are not yet available.

5 Atmospheric abundances of trace gases are reported here as the mole fraction (molar mixing ratio) of the gas relative to dry air (ppm = 10−6, ppb = 10−9, 

ppt = 10−12). Atmospheric burden is reported as the total mass of the gas (e.g., Mt = Tg = 1012 g). The global carbon cycle is expressed in PgC = GtC.

1989 to 1998 derived using SAR methodology for the IPCC
Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
(2000). The terrestrial biosphere as a whole has gained carbon
during the 1980s and 1990s; i.e., the CO2 released by land-
use change (mainly tropical deforestation) was more than
compensated by other terrestrial sinks, which are likely
located in both the northern extra-tropics and in the tropics.
There remain large uncertainties associated with estimating
the CO2 release due to land-use change (and, therefore, with
the magnitude of the residual terrestrial sink).

Process-based modelling (terrestrial and ocean carbon
models) has allowed preliminary quantification of
mechanisms in the global carbon cycle. Terrestrial model
results indicate that enhanced plant growth due to higher CO2
(CO2 fertilisation) and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition
contribute significantly to CO2 uptake, i.e., are potentially
responsible for the residual terrestrial sink described above,
along with other proposed mechanisms, such as changes in
land-management practices. The modelled effects of climate
change during the 1980s on the terrestrial sink are small and
of uncertain sign.

Methane (CH4)
Atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations have increased by
about 150% (1,060 ppb) since 1750. The present CH4
concentration has not been exceeded during the past 420,000
years. Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas with both natural
(e.g., wetlands) and human-influenced sources (e.g.,
agriculture, natural gas activities, and landfills). Slightly more
than half of current CH4 emissions are anthropogenic. It is
removed from the atmosphere by chemical reactions. As
Figure 11 shows, systematic, globally representative
measurements of the concentration of CH4 in the atmosphere
have been made since 1983, and the record of atmospheric
concentrations has been extended to earlier times from air
extracted from ice cores and firn layers. The current direct
radiative forcing of 0.48 Wm−2 from CH4 is 20% of the total
from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse
gases (see Figure 9).

The atmospheric abundance of CH4 continues to increase,
from about 1,610 ppb in 1983 to 1,745 ppb in 1998, but the
observed annual increase has declined during this period.
The increase was highly variable during the 1990s; it was
near zero in 1992 and as large as 13 ppb during 1998. There
is no clear quantitative explanation for this variability. Since

Figure 11: (a) Change in CH4 abundance (mole fraction, in ppb = 10−9)
determined from ice cores, firn, and whole air samples plotted for the
last 1000 years. Radiative forcing, approximated by a linear scale since
the pre-industrial era, is plotted on the right axis. (b) Globally averaged
CH4 (monthly varying) and deseasonalised CH4 (smooth line)
abundance plotted for 1983 to 1999. (c) Instantaneous annual growth
rate (ppb/yr) in global atmospheric CH4 abundance from 1983 through
1999 calculated as the derivative of the deseasonalised trend curve

on Figure 4.1]

the SAR, quantification of certain anthropogenic sources of
CH4, such as that from rice production, has improved.
The rate of increase in atmospheric CH4 is due to a small
imbalance between poorly characterised sources and sinks,
which makes the prediction of future concentrations
problematic. Although the major contributors to the global
CH4 budget likely have been identified, most of them are quite
uncertain quantitatively because of the difficulty in assessing
emission rates of highly variable biospheric sources. The
limitations of poorly quantified and characterised CH4 source
strengths inhibit the prediction of future CH4 atmospheric
concentrations (and hence its contribution to radiative forcing)
for any given anthropogenic emission scenario, particularly
since both natural emissions and the removal of CH4 can be
influenced substantially by climate change.

Nitrous oxide (N2O)
The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) has
steadily increased during the Industrial Era and is now 16%
(46 ppb) larger than in 1750. The present N2O concentration
has not been exceeded during at least the past thousand years.
Nitrous oxide is another greenhouse gas with both natural and
anthropogenic sources, and it is removed from the atmosphere
by chemical reactions. Atmospheric concentrations of N2O
continue to increase at a rate of 0.25%/yr (1980 to 1998).
Significant interannual variations in the upward trend of N2O
concentrations are observed, e.g., a 50% reduction in annual
growth rate from 1991 to 1993. Suggested causes are several-
fold: a decrease in use of nitrogen-based fertiliser, lower
biogenic emissions, and larger stratospheric losses due to
volcanic-induced circulation changes. Since 1993, the growth
of N2O concentrations has returned to rates closer to those
observed during the 1980s. While this observed multi-year
variance has provided some potential insight into what
processes control the behaviour of atmospheric N2O, the
multi-year trends of this greenhouse gas remain largely
unexplained.

The global budget of nitrous oxide is in better balance than in
the SAR, but uncertainties in the emissions from individual
sources are still quite large. Natural sources of N2O are
estimated to be approximately 10 TgN/yr (1990), with soils
being about 65% of the sources and oceans about 30%. 
New, higher estimates of the emissions from anthropogenic
sources (agriculture, biomass burning, industrial activities,
and livestock management) of approximately 7 TgN/yr have

brought the source/sink estimates closer in balance, compared
with the SAR. However, the predictive understanding
associated with this significant, long-lived greenhouse gas has
not improved significantly since the last assessment. The
radiative forcing is estimated at 0.15 Wm−2, which is 6% of
the total from all of the long-lived and globally mixed
greenhouse gases (see Figure 9).

are both ozone-depleting and greenhouse gases are either
decreasing (CFC-11, CFC-113, CH3CCl3 and CCl4) or
increasing more slowly (CFC-12) in response to reduced
emissions under the regulations of the Montreal Protocol and
its Amendments. Many of these halocarbons are also
radiatively effective, long-lived greenhouse gases.
Halocarbons are carbon compounds that contain fluorine,
chlorine, bromine or iodine. For most of these compounds,
human activities are the sole source. Halocarbons that
contain chlorine (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons - CFCs) and
bromine (e.g., halons) cause depletion of the stratospheric
ozone layer and are controlled under the Montreal Protocol.
The combined tropospheric abundance of ozone-depleting
gases peaked in 1994 and is slowly declining. The
atmospheric abundances of some of the major greenhouse
halocarbons have peaked, as shown for CFC-11 in Figure 12.
The concentrations of CFCs and chlorocarbons in the
troposphere are consistent with reported emissions.
Halocarbons contribute a radiative forcing of 0.34 Wm−2,
which is 14% of the radiative forcing from all of the globally
mixed greenhouse gases (Figure 9).

The observed atmospheric concentrations of the substitutes for
the CFCs are increasing, and some of these compounds are
greenhouse gases. The abundances of the hydrochlorofluoro-
carbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are
increasing as a result of continuation of earlier uses and of
their use as substitutes for the CFCs. For example, the concen-
tration of HFC-23 has increased by more than a factor of three
between 1978 and 1995. Because current concentrations are
relatively low, the present contribution of HFCs to radiative
forcing is relatively small. The present contribution of HCFCs
to radiative forcing is also relatively small, and future
emissions of these gases are limited by the Montreal Protocol.

The perfluorocarbons (PFCs, e.g., CF4 and C2F6) and sulphur
hexafluoride (SF6) have anthropogenic sources, have extremely

Further, ozone is not a directly emitted species, but rather it is
formed in the atmosphere from photochemical processes
involving both natural and human-influenced precursor
species. Once formed, the residence time of ozone in the
atmosphere is relatively short, varying from weeks to months.
As a result, estimation of ozone’s radiative role is more
complex and much less certain than for the above long-lived
and globally well-mixed greenhouse gases.

The observed losses of stratospheric ozone layer over the past
two decades have caused a negative forcing of 
0.15 ±0.1 Wm−2 (i.e., a tendency toward cooling) of the
surface troposphere system. It was reported in Climate Change
1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific
Assessment, that depletion of the ozone layer by anthro-
pogenic halocarbons introduces a negative radiative forcing.
The estimate shown in Figure 9 is slightly larger in magnitude
than that given in the SAR, owing to the ozone depletion that
has continued over the past five years, and it is more certain as
a result of an increased number of modelling studies. Studies
with General Circulation Models indicate that, despite the
inhomogeneity in ozone loss (i.e., lower stratosphere at high
latitudes), such a negative forcing does relate to a surface
temperature decrease in proportion to the magnitude of the
negative forcing. Therefore, this negative forcing over the past
two decades has offset some of the positive forcing that is
occurring from the long-lived and globally well-mixed
greenhouse gases (Figure 9). A major source of uncertainty in
the estimation of the negative forcing is due to incomplete
knowledge of ozone depletion near the tropopause. Model
calculations indicate that increased penetration of ultraviolet
radiation to the troposphere, as a result of stratospheric ozone
depletion, leads to enhanced removal rates of gases like CH4,
thus amplifying the negative forcing due to ozone depletion.
As the ozone layer recovers in future decades because of the
effects of the Montreal Protocol, relative to the present, future
radiative forcing associated with stratospheric ozone is
projected to become positive.

The global average radiative forcing due to increases in
tropospheric ozone since pre-industrial times is estimated to
have enhanced the anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing by
0.35 ±0.2 Wm−2. This makes tropospheric ozone the third
most important greenhouse gas after CO2 and CH4. Ozone is
formed by photochemical reactions and its future change will
be determined by, among other things, emissions of CH4 and

long atmospheric residence times, and are strong absorbers of
infrared radiation. Therefore, these compounds, even with
relatively small emissions, have the potential to influence
climate far into the future. Perfluoromethane (CF4) resides in
the atmosphere for at least 50,000 years. It has a natural
background; however, current anthropogenic emissions exceed
natural ones by a factor of 1,000 or more and are responsible
for the observed increase. Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) is 22,200
times more effective a greenhouse gas than CO2 on a per-kg
basis. The current atmospheric concentrations are very small
(4.2 ppt), but have a significant growth rate (0.24 ppt/yr).
There is good agreement between the observed atmospheric
growth rate of SF6 and the emissions based on revised sales
and storage data.

Atmospheric  ozone  (O 3)
Ozone (O3) is an important greenhouse gas present in both the
stratosphere and troposphere. The role of ozone in the
atmospheric radiation budget is strongly dependent on the
altitude at which changes in ozone concentrations occur. The
changes in ozone concentrations are also spatially variable.

pollutants (as noted below). Ozone concentrations respond
relatively quickly to changes in the emissions of pollutants. On
the basis of limited observations and several modelling studies,
tropospheric ozone is estimated to have increased by about
35% since the Pre-industrial Era, with some regions experi-
encing larger and some with smaller increases. There have
been few observed increases in ozone concentrations in the
global troposphere since the mid-1980s at most of the few
remote locations where it is regularly measured. The lack of
observed increase over North America and Europe is related to
the lack of a sustained increase in ozone-precursor emissions
from those continents. However, some Asian stations indicate
a possible rise in tropospheric ozone, which could be related to
the increase in East Asian emissions. As a result of more
modelling studies than before, there is now an increased
confidence in the estimates of tropospheric ozone forcing. The
confidence, however, is still much less than that for the well-mixed
greenhouse gases, but more so than that for aerosol forcing.
Uncertainties arise because of limited information on pre-industrial
ozone distributions and limited information to evaluate
modelled global trends in the modern era (i.e., post-1960).

Gases  with  only  indirect  radiative  influences
Several chemically reactive gases, including reactive nitrogen
species (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and the volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), control, in part, the oxidising capacity of
the troposphere, as well as the abundance of ozone. These
pollutants act as indirect greenhouse gases through their
influence not only on ozone, but also on the lifetimes of CH4
and other greenhouse gases. The emissions of NOx and CO are
dominated by human activities.

Carbon monoxide is identified as an important indirect
greenhouse gas. Model calculations indicate that emission of 
100 Mt of CO is equivalent in terms of greenhouse gas 
perturbations to the emission of about 5 Mt of CH4. The
abundance of CO in the Northern Hemisphere is about twice that
in the Southern Hemisphere and has increased in the second half
of the 20th century along with industrialisation and population. 

The reactive nitrogen species NO and NO2, (whose sum is
denoted NOx), are key compounds in the chemistry of the
troposphere, but their overall radiative impact remains
difficult to quantify. The importance of NOx in the radiation
budget is because increases in NOx concentrations perturb
several greenhouse gases; for example, decreases in methane
and the HFCs and increases in tropospheric ozone. Deposition

of the reaction products of NOx fertilises the biosphere,
thereby decreasing atmospheric CO2. While difficult to
quantify, increases in NOx that are projected to the year 2100
would cause significant changes in greenhouse gases.

Aerosols

Aerosols (very small airborne particles and droplets) are
known to influence significantly the radiative budget of the
Earth/atmosphere. Aerosol radiative effects occur in two
distinct ways: (i) the direct effect, whereby aerosols
themselves scatter and absorb solar and thermal infrared
radiation, and (ii) the indirect effect, whereby aerosols
modify the microphysical and hence the radiative properties
and amount of clouds. Aerosols are produced by a variety of
processes, both natural (including dust storms and volcanic
activity) and anthropogenic (including fossil fuel and
biomass burning). The atmospheric concentrations of 
tropospheric aerosols are thought to have increased over
recent years due to increased anthropogenic emissions of
particles and their precursor gases, hence giving rise to
radiative forcing. Most aerosols are found in the lower
troposphere (below a few kilometres), but the radiative effect
of many aerosols is sensitive to the vertical distribution.
Aerosols undergo chemical and physical changes while in the
atmosphere, notably within clouds, and are removed largely
and relatively rapidly by precipitation (typically within a
week). Because of this short residence time and the 
inhomogeneity of sources, aerosols are distributed 
inhomogeneously in the troposphere, with maxima near the
sources. The radiative forcing due to aerosols depends not
only on these spatial distributions, but also on the size,
shape, and chemical composition of the particles and various
aspects (e.g., cloud formation) of the hydrological cycle as
well. As a result of all of these factors, obtaining accurate
estimates of this forcing has been very challenging, from
both the observational and theoretical standpoints.

Nevertheless, substantial progress has been achieved in better
defining the direct effect of a wider set of different aerosols. The
SAR considered the direct effects of only three anthropogenic
aerosol species: sulphate aerosols, biomass-burning aerosols,
and fossil fuel black carbon (or soot). Observations have now
shown the importance of organic materials in both fossil fuel
carbon aerosols and biomass-burning carbon aerosols. Since

44

the SAR, the inclusion of estimates for the abundance of
fossil fuel organic carbon aerosols has led to an increase in
the predicted total optical depth (and consequent negative
forcing) associated with industrial aerosols. Advances in
observations and in aerosol and radiative models have allowed
quantitative estimates of these separate components, as well
as an estimate for the range of radiative forcing associated
with mineral dust, as shown in Figure 9. Direct radiative
forcing is estimated to be −0.4 Wm−2 for sulphate,
−0.2 Wm−2 for biomass-burning aerosols, −0.1 Wm−2 for
fossil fuel organic carbon, and +0.2 Wm−2 for fossil fuel black
carbon aerosols. Uncertainties remain relatively large,
however. These arise from difficulties in determining the
concentration and radiative characteristics of atmospheric
aerosols and the fraction of the aerosols that are of anthropogenic
origin, particularly the knowledge of the sources of
carbonaceous aerosols. This leads to considerable differences
(i.e., factor of two to three range) in the burden and
substantial differences in the vertical distribution (factor of
ten). Anthropogenic dust aerosol is also poorly quantified.
Satellite observations, combined with model calculations, are
enabling the identification of the spatial signature of the total
aerosol radiative effect in clear skies; however, the quanti-
tative amount is still uncertain.

Estimates of the indirect radiative forcing by anthropogenic
aerosols remain problematic, although observational evidence
points to a negative aerosol-induced indirect forcing in warm
clouds. Two different approaches exist for estimating the
indirect effect of aerosols: empirical methods and mechanistic
methods. The former have been applied to estimate the effects
of industrial aerosols, while the latter have been applied to
estimate the effects of sulphate, fossil fuel carbonaceous
aerosols, and biomass aerosols. In addition, models for the
indirect effect have been used to estimate the effects of the
initial change in droplet size and concentrations (a first
indirect effect), as well as the effects of the subsequent change
in precipitation efficiency (a second indirect effect). The
studies represented in Figure 9 provide an expert judgement
for the range of the first of these; the range is now slightly
wider than in the SAR; the radiative perturbation associated
with the second indirect effect is of the same sign and could be
of similar magnitude compared to the first effect.

The indirect radiative effect of aerosols is now understood to
also encompass effects on ice and mixed-phase clouds, but the

magnitude of any such indirect effect is not known, although it
is likely to be positive. It is not possible to estimate the number
of anthropogenic ice nuclei at the present time. Except at cold
temperatures (below −45°C) where homogeneous nucleation is
expected to dominate, the mechanisms of ice formation in
these clouds are not yet known.

Land-use  (albedo)  chang e
Changes in land use, deforestation being the major factor,
appear to have produced a negative radiative forcing of 
−0.2 ±0.2 Wm−2 (Figure 8). The largest effect is estimated to be
at the high latitudes. This is because deforestation has caused
snow-covered forests with relatively low albedo to be replaced
with open, snow-covered areas with higher albedo. The estimate
given above is based on simulations in which pre-industrial
vegetation is replaced by current land-use patterns. However, the
level of understanding is very low for this forcing, and there
have been far fewer investigations of this forcing compared to
investigations of other factors considered in this report.

Solar  and Volcanic  Activity

Radiative forcing of the climate system due to solar irradiance
change is estimated to be 0.3 ±0.2 Wm−2 for the period 1750
to the present (Figure 8), and most of the change is estimated
to have occurred during the first half of the 20th century. The
fundamental source of all energy in the Earth’s climate system
is radiation from the Sun. Therefore, variation in solar output
is a radiative forcing agent. The absolute value of the
spectrally integrated total solar irradiance (TSI) incident on the
Earth is not known to better than about 4 Wm−2, but satellite
observations since the late 1970s show relative variations over
the past two solar 11-year activity cycles of about 0.1%, which
is equivalent to a variation in radiative forcing of about 0.2
Wm−2. Prior to these satellite observations, reliable direct
measurements of solar irradiance are not available. Variations
over longer periods may have been larger, but the techniques
used to reconstruct historical values of TSI from proxy
observations (e.g., sunspots) have not been adequately verified.
Solar variation varies more substantially in the ultraviolet
region, and studies with climate models suggest that inclusion
of spectrally resolved solar irradiance variations and solar-

45

induced stratospheric ozone changes may improve the realism
of model simulations of the impact of solar variability on
climate. Other mechanisms for the amplification of solar
effects on climate have been proposed, but do not have a
rigorous theoretical or observational basis.

Stratospheric aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions lead
to negative forcing that lasts a few years. Several explosive
eruptions occurred in the periods 1880 to 1920 and 1960 to
1991, and no explosive eruptions since 1991. Enhanced
stratospheric aerosol content due to volcanic eruptions,
together with the small solar irradiance variations, result in a
net negative natural radiative forcing over the past two, and
possibly even the past four, decades.

C.6  Global Warming  Potentials

Radiative forcings and Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) are
presented in Table 3 for an expanded set of gases. GWPs are a
measure of the relative radiative effect of a given substance
compared to CO2, integrated over a chosen time horizon. New
categories of gases in Table 3 include fluorinated organic
molecules, many of which are ethers that are proposed as
halocarbon substitutes. Some of the GWPs have larger
uncertainties than that of others, particularly for those gases
where detailed laboratory data on lifetimes are not yet
available. The direct GWPs have been calculated relative to
CO2 using an improved calculation of the CO2 radiative
forcing, the SAR response function for a CO2 pulse, and new
values for the radiative forcing and lifetimes for a number of
halocarbons. Indirect GWPs, resulting from indirect radiative
forcing effects, are also estimated for some new gases,
including carbon monoxide. The direct GWPs for those species
whose lifetimes are well characterised are estimated to be
accurate within ±35%, but the indirect GWPs are less certain.

D. The  Simulation  of  the  Climate
System  and  its  Chang es 

The preceding two Sections reported on the climate from the
distant past to the present day through the observations of
climate variables and the forcing agents that cause climate to
change. This Section bridges to the climate of the future by
describing the only tool that provides quantitative estimates of
future climate changes, namely, numerical models. The basic
understanding of the energy balance of the Earth system means
that quite simple models can provide a broad quantitative
estimate of some globally averaged variables, but more accurate
estimates of feedbacks and of regional detail can only come from
more elaborate climate models. The complexity of the processes
in the climate system prevents the use of extrapolation of past
trends or statistical and other purely empirical techniques for
projections. Climate models can be used to simulate the climate
responses to different input scenarios of future forcing agents
(Section F). Similarly, projection of the fate of emitted CO2 (i.e.,
the relative sequestration into the various reservoirs) and other
greenhouse gases requires an understanding of the biogeo-
chemical processes involved and incorporating these into a
numerical carbon cycle model.

A climate model is a simplified mathematical representation of
the Earth’s climate system (see Box 3). The degree to which the
model can simulate the responses of the climate system hinges to
a very large degree on the level of understanding of the physical,
geophysical, chemical and biological processes that govern the
climate system. Since the SAR, researchers have made
substantial improvements in the simulation of the Earth’s climate
system with models. First, the current understanding of some of
the most important processes that govern the climate system and
how well they are represented in present climate models are
summarised here. Then, this Section presents an assessment of
the overall ability of present models to make useful projections
of future climate.

D.1 Climate Processes and Feedbacks 

Processes in the climate system determine the natural
variability of the climate system and its response to perturbations,
such as the increase in the atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases. Many basic climate processes of importance
are well-known and modelled exceedingly well. Feedback
processes amplify (a positive feedback) or reduce (a negative

Box  3: Climate  Models: How
are  they  built  and  how  are  they
applied?
Comprehensive climate models are
based on physical laws represented by
mathematical equations that are solved
using a three-dimensional grid over the
globe. For climate simulation, the
major components of the climate
system must be represented in sub-
models (atmosphere, ocean, land
surface, cryosphere and biosphere),
along with the processes that go on
within and between them. Most results
in this report are derived from the
results of models, which include some
representation of all these components.
Global climate models in which the
atmosphere and ocean components have
been coupled together are also known
as Atmosphere-Ocean General
Circulation Models (AOGCMs). In the
atmospheric module, for example,
equations are solved that describe the
large-scale evolution of momentum,
heat and moisture. Similar equations
are solved for the ocean. Currently, the
resolution of the atmospheric part of a
typical model is about 250 km in the
horizontal and about 1 km in the
vertical above the boundary layer. The
resolution of a typical ocean model is
about 200 to 400 m in the vertical, with
a horizontal resolution of about 125 to
250 km. Equations are typically solved
for every half hour of a model
integration. Many physical processes,
such as those related to clouds or ocean
convection, take place on much smaller
spatial scales than the model grid and
therefore cannot be modelled and
resolved explicitly. Their average
effects are approximately included in a
simple way by taking advantage of

physically based relationships with the
larger-scale variables. This technique is
known as parametrization.

In order to make quantitative
projections of future climate change, it
is necessary to use climate models that
simulate all the important processes
governing the future evolution of the
climate. Climate models have
developed over the past few decades as
computing power has increased. During
that time, models of the main
components, atmosphere, land, ocean
and sea ice have been developed
separately and then gradually
integrated. This coupling of the various
components is a difficult process. Most
recently, sulphur cycle components

have been incorporated to represent the
emissions of sulphur and how they are
oxidised to form aerosol particles.
Currently in progress, in a few models,
is the coupling of the land carbon cycle
and the ocean carbon cycle. The
atmospheric chemistry component
currently is modelled outside the main
climate model. The ultimate aim is, of
course, to model as much as possible of
the whole of the Earth’s climate system
so that all the components can interact
and, thus, the predictions of climate
change will continuously take into
account the effect of feedbacks among
components. The Figure above shows
the past, present and possible future
evolution of climate models.

48

Some models offset errors and surface flux imbalances
through “flux adjustments”, which are empirically
determined systematic adjustments at the atmosphere-
ocean interface held fixed in time in order to bring the
simulated climate closer to the observed state. A strategy
has been designed for carrying out climate experiments
that removes much of the effects of some model errors on
results. What is often done is that first a “control” climate
simulation is run with the model. Then, the climate
change experiment simulation is run, for example, with
increased CO2 in the model atmosphere. Finally, the
difference is taken to provide an estimate of the change in
climate due to the perturbation. The differencing
technique removes most of the effects of any artificial
adjustments in the model, as well as systematic errors that
are common to both runs. However, a comparison of
different model results makes it apparent that the nature
of some errors still influences the outcome. 

Many aspects of the Earth’s climate system are chaotic –
its evolution is sensitive to small perturbations in initial
conditions. This sensitivity limits predictability of the
detailed evolution of weather to about two weeks.
However, predictability of climate is not so limited
because of the systematic influences on the atmosphere of
the more slowly varying components of the climate
system. Nevertheless, to be able to make reliable forecasts
in the presence of both initial condition and model
uncertainty, it is desirable to repeat the prediction many
times from different perturbed initial states and using
different global models. These ensembles are the basis of
probability forecasts of the climate state.

Comprehensive AOGCMs are very complex and take
large computer resources to run. To explore different
scenarios of emissions of greenhouse gases and the
effects of assumptions or approximations in parameters in
the model more thoroughly, simpler models are also
widely used. The  simplifications may include coarser
resolution and simplified dynamics and physical
processes. Together, simple, intermediate, and compre-
hensive models form a “hierarchy of climate models”, all
of which are necessary to explore choices made in
parametrizations and assess the robustness of climate
changes.

feedback) changes in response to an initial perturbation and
hence are very important for accurate simulation of the
evolution of climate. 

Water vapour
A major feedback accounting for the large warming predicted by
climate models in response to an increase in CO2 is the increase
in atmospheric water vapour. An increase in the temperature of
the atmosphere increases its water-holding capacity; however,
since most of the atmosphere is undersaturated, this does not
automatically mean that water vapour, itself, must increase.
Within the boundary layer (roughly the lowest 1 to 2 km of the
atmosphere), water vapour increases with increasing temperature.
In the free troposphere above the boundary layer, where the
water vapour greenhouse effect is most important, the situation is
harder to quantify. Water vapour feedback, as derived from
current models, approximately doubles the warming from what it
would be for fixed water vapour. Since the SAR, major
improvements have occurred in the treatment of water vapour in
models, although detrainment of moisture from clouds remains
quite uncertain and discrepancies exist between model water
vapour distributions and those observed. Models are capable of
simulating the moist and very dry regions observed in the tropics
and sub-tropics and how they evolve with the seasons and from
year to year. While reassuring, this does not provide a check of
the feedbacks, although the balance of evidence favours a
positive clear-sky water vapour feedback of the magnitude
comparable to that found in simulations.

Clouds
As has been the case since the first IPCC Assessment Report in
1990, probably the greatest uncertainty in future projections of
climate arises from clouds and their interactions with radiation.
Clouds can both absorb and reflect solar radiation (thereby
cooling the surface) and absorb and emit long wave radiation
(thereby warming the surface). The competition between these
effects depends on cloud height, thickness and radiative
properties. The radiative properties and evolution of clouds
depend on the distribution of atmospheric water vapour, water
drops, ice particles, atmospheric aerosols and cloud thickness.
The physical basis of cloud parametrizations is greatly improved
in models through inclusion of bulk representation of cloud
microphysical properties in a cloud water budget equation,
although considerable uncertainty remains. Clouds represent a
significant source of potential error in climate simulations. The
possibility that models underestimate systematically solar

49

absorption in clouds remains a controversial matter. The sign of
the net cloud feedback is still a matter of uncertainty, and the
various models exhibit a large spread. Further uncertainties arise
from precipitation processes and the difficulty in correctly
simulating the diurnal cycle and precipitation amounts and
frequencies. 

Stratosphere
There has been a growing appreciation of the importance of
the stratosphere in the climate system because of changes in
its structure and recognition of the vital role of both radiative
and dynamical processes. The vertical profile of temperature
change in the atmosphere, including the stratosphere, is an
important indicator in detection and attribution studies. Most
of the observed decreases in lower-stratospheric temperatures
have been due to ozone decreases, of which the Antarctic
“ozone hole” is a part, rather than increased CO2 concen-
trations. Waves generated in the troposphere can propagate
into the stratosphere where they are absorbed. As a result,
stratospheric changes alter where and how these waves are
absorbed, and the effects can extend downward into the
troposphere. Changes in solar irradiance, mainly in the
ultraviolet (UV), lead to photochemically-induced ozone
changes and, hence, alter the stratospheric heating rates, which
can alter the tropospheric circulation. Limitations in resolution
and relatively poor representation of some stratospheric
processes adds uncertainty to model results.

Ocean 
Major improvements have taken place in modelling ocean
processes, in particular heat transport. These improvements, in
conjunction with an increase in resolution, have been
important in reducing the need for flux adjustment in models
and in producing realistic simulations of natural large-scale
circulation patterns and improvements in simulating El Niño
(see Box 4). Ocean currents carry heat from the tropics to
higher latitudes. The ocean exchanges heat, water (through
evaporation and precipitation) and CO2 with the atmosphere.
Because of its huge mass and high heat capacity, the ocean
slows climate change and influences the time-scales of
variability in the ocean-atmosphere system. Considerable
progress has been made in the understanding of ocean
processes relevant for climate change. Increases in resolution,
as well as improved representation (parametrization) of
important sub-grid scale processes (e.g., mesoscale eddies),
have increased the realism of simulations. Major uncertainties

still exist with the representation of small-scale processes, such
as overflows (flow through narrow channels, e.g., between
Greenland and Iceland), western boundary currents (i.e., large-
scale narrow currents along coastlines), convection and mixing.
Boundary currents in climate simulations are weaker and wider
than in nature, although the consequences of this for climate
are not clear.

Cryosphere 
The representation of sea-ice processes continues to improve,
with several climate models now incorporating physically based
treatments of ice dynamics. The representation of land-ice
processes in global climate models remains rudimentary. The
cryosphere consists of those regions of Earth that are seasonally
or perennially covered by snow and ice. Sea ice is important
because it reflects more incoming solar radiation than the sea
surface (i.e., it has a higher albedo), and it insulates the sea from
heat loss during the winter. Therefore, reduction of sea ice gives
a positive feedback on climate warming at high latitudes.
Furthermore, because sea ice contains less salt than sea water,
when sea ice is formed the salt content (salinity) and density of
the surface layer of the ocean is increased. This promotes an
exchange of water with deeper layers of the ocean, affecting
ocean circulation. The formation of icebergs and the melting of
ice shelves returns fresh water from the land to the ocean, so that
changes in the rates of these processes could affect ocean
circulation by changing the surface salinity. Snow has a higher
albedo than the land surface; hence, reductions in snow cover
lead to a similar positive albedo feedback, although weaker than
for sea ice. Increasingly complex snow schemes and sub-grid
scale variability in ice cover and thickness, which can signifi-
cantly influence albedo and atmosphere-ocean exchanges, are
being introduced in some climate models.

Land surface
Research with models containing the latest representations of
the land surface indicates that the direct effects of increased
CO2 on the physiology of plants could lead to a relative
reduction in evapotranspiration over the tropical continents,
with associated regional warming and drying over that
predicted for conventional greenhouse warming effects. Land
surface changes provide important feedbacks as anthropogenic
climate changes (e.g., increased temperature, changes in precipi-
tation, changes in net radiative heating, and the direct effects of
CO2) will influence the state of the land surface (e.g., soil
moisture, albedo, roughness and vegetation). Exchanges of

50

energy, momentum, water, heat and carbon between the land
surface and the atmosphere can be defined in models as
functions of the type and density of the local vegetation and the
depth and physical properties of the soil, all based on land-
surface data bases that have been improved using satellite
observations. Recent advances in the understanding of
vegetation photosynthesis and water use have been used to
couple the terrestrial energy, water and carbon cycles within a
new generation of land surface parametrizations, which have
been tested against field observations and implemented in a few
GCMs, with demonstrable improvements in the simulation of
land-atmosphere fluxes. However, significant problems remain
to be solved in the areas of soil moisture processes, runoff
prediction, land-use change and the treatment of snow and sub-
grid scale heterogeneity.

Changes in land-surface cover can affect global climate in
several ways. Large-scale deforestation in the humid tropics
(e.g., South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia) has been
identified as the most important ongoing land-surface process,
because it reduces evaporation and increases surface temperature.
These effects are qualitatively reproduced by most models.
However, large uncertainties still persist on the quantitative
impact of large-scale deforestation on the hydrological cycle,
particularly over Amazonia.

Carbon cycle
Recent improvements in process-based terrestrial and ocean
carbon cycle models and their evaluation against observations
have given more confidence in their use for future scenario
studies. CO2 naturally cycles rapidly among the atmosphere,
oceans and land. However, the removal of the CO2 perturbation
added by human activities from the atmosphere takes far longer.
This is because of processes that limit the rate at which ocean
and terrestrial carbon stocks can increase. Anthropogenic CO2 is
taken up by the ocean because of its high solubility (caused by
the nature of carbonate chemistry), but the rate of uptake is
limited by the finite speed of vertical mixing. Anthropogenic
CO2 is taken up by terrestrial ecosystems through several
possible mechanisms, for example, land management, CO2 fertil-
isation (the enhancement of plant growth as a result of increased
atmospheric CO2 concentration) and increasing anthropogenic
inputs of nitrogen. This uptake is limited by the relatively small
fraction of plant carbon that can enter long-term storage (wood
and humus). The fraction of emitted CO2 that can be taken up by
the oceans and land is expected to decline with increasing CO2

concentrations. Process-based models of the ocean and land
carbon cycles (including representations of physical, chemical
and biological processes) have been developed and evaluated
against measurements pertinent to the natural carbon cycle. Such
models have also been set up to mimic the human perturbation
of the carbon cycle and have been able to generate time-series of
ocean and land carbon uptake that are broadly consistent with
observed global trends. There are still substantial differences
among models, especially in how they treat the physical ocean
circulation and in regional responses of terrestrial ecosystem
processes to climate. Nevertheless, current models consistently
indicate that when the effects of climate change are considered,
CO2 uptake by oceans and land becomes smaller.

D.2 The Coupled Systems

As noted in Section D.1, many feedbacks operate within the
individual components of the climate system (atmosphere, ocean,
cryosphere and land surface). However, many important
processes and feedbacks occur through the coupling of the
climate system components. Their representation is important to
the prediction of large-scale responses.

Modes of natural variability
There is an increasing realisation that natural circulation
patterns, such as ENSO and NAO, play a fundamental role in
global climate and its interannual and longer-term variability.
The strongest natural fluctuation of climate on interannual time-
scales is the ENSO phenomenon (see Box 4). It is an inherently
coupled atmosphere-ocean mode with its core activity in the
tropical Pacific, but with important regional climate impacts
throughout the world. Global climate models are only now
beginning to exhibit variability in the tropical Pacific that
resembles ENSO, mainly through increased meridional
resolution at the equator. Patterns of sea surface temperature and
atmospheric circulation similar to those occurring during ENSO
on interannual time-scales also occur on decadal and longer
time-scales.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant pattern of
northern wintertime atmospheric circulation variability and is
increasingly being simulated realistically. The NAO is closely
related to the Arctic Oscillation (AO), which has an additional
annular component around the Arctic. There is strong evidence
that the NAO arises mainly from internal atmospheric processes
involving the entire troposphere-stratosphere system.

51

Box  4: The  El  Niño-Southern
Oscillation  (ENSO)
The strongest natural fluctuation of
climate on interannual time-scales is the
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
phenomenon. The term “El Niño”
originally applied to an annual weak
warm ocean current that ran southwards
along the coast of Peru about
Christmas-time and only subsequently
became associated with the unusually
large warmings. The coastal warming,
however, is often associated with a
much more extensive anomalous ocean
warming to the International Dateline,
and it is this Pacific basinwide
phenomenon that forms the link with
the anomalous global climate patterns.
The atmospheric component tied to “El
Niño” is termed the “Southern
Oscillation”. Scientists often call this
phenomenon, where the atmosphere
and ocean collaborate together, ENSO
(El Niño-Southern Oscillation).

ENSO is a natural phenomenon, and
there is good evidence from cores of
coral and glacial ice in the Andes that it
has been going on for millennia. The
ocean and atmospheric conditions in the
tropical Pacific are seldom average, but
instead fluctuate somewhat irregularly
between El Niño events and the opposite
“La Niña” phase, consisting of a
basinwide cooling of the tropical Pacific,
with a preferred period of about three to
six years. The most intense phase of
each event usually lasts about a year. 

A distinctive pattern of sea surface
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean sets
the stage for ENSO events. Key
features are the “warm pool” in the
tropical western Pacific, where the
warmest ocean waters in the world
reside, much colder waters in the
eastern Pacific, and a cold tongue
along the equator that is most
pronounced about October and
weakest in March. The atmospheric
easterly trade winds in the tropics pile
up the warm waters in the west,
producing an upward slope of sea level
along the equator of 0.60 m from east
to west. The winds drive the surface
ocean currents, which determine where
the surface waters flow and diverge.
Thus, cooler nutrient-rich waters
upwell from below along the equator
and western coasts of the Americas,
favouring development of
phytoplankton, zooplankton, and hence
fish. Because convection and thunder-
storms preferentially occur over
warmer waters, the pattern of sea
surface temperatures determines the
distribution of rainfall in the tropics,
and this in turn determines the
atmospheric heating patterns through
the release of latent heat. The heating
drives the large-scale monsoonal-type
circulations in the tropics, and
consequently determines the winds.
This strong coupling between the
atmosphere and ocean in the tropics
gives rise to the El Niño phenomenon.

During El Niño, the warm waters from
the western tropical Pacific migrate
eastward as the trade winds weaken,
shifting the pattern of tropical
rainstorms, further weakening the
trade winds, and thus reinforcing the
changes in sea temperatures. Sea level
drops in the west, but rises in the east
by as much as 0.25 m, as warm waters
surge eastward along the equator.
However, the changes in atmospheric
circulation are not confined to the
tropics, but extend globally and
influence the jet streams and storm
tracks in mid-latitudes. Approximately
reverse patterns occur during the
opposite La Niña phase of the
phenomenon.

Changes associated with ENSO
produce large variations in weather
and climate around the world from
year to year. These often have a
profound impact on humanity and
society because of associated
droughts, floods, heat waves and other
changes that can severely disrupt
agriculture, fisheries, the environment,
health, energy demand, air quality and
also change the risks of fire. ENSO
also plays a prominent role in
modulating exchanges of CO2 with the
atmosphere. The normal upwelling of
cold nutrient-rich and CO2-rich waters
in the tropical Pacific is suppressed
during El Niño.

Fluctuations in Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) are
related to the strength of the NAO, and a modest two-way
interaction between the NAO and the Atlantic Ocean, leading to
decadal variability, is emerging as important in projecting
climate change.

Climate change may manifest itself both as shifting means, as
well as changing preference of specific climate regimes, as

evidenced by the observed trend toward positive values for the
last 30 years in the NAO index and the climate “shift” in the
tropical Pacific about 1976. While coupled models simulate
features of observed natural climate variability, such as the
NAO and ENSO, which suggests that many of the relevant
processes are included in the models, further progress is
needed to depict these natural modes accurately. Moreover,

52

because ENSO and NAO are key determinants of regional
climate change and can possibly result in abrupt and counter
intuitive changes, there has been an increase in uncertainty in
those aspects of climate change that critically depend on
regional changes. 

The thermohaline circulation (THC) 
The thermohaline circulation (THC) is responsible for the major
part of the meridional heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean. The
THC is a global-scale overturning in the ocean driven by density
differences arising from temperature and salinity effects. In the
Atlantic, heat is transported by warm surface waters flowing
northward and cold saline waters from the North Atlantic
returning at depth. Reorganisations in the Atlantic THC can be
triggered by perturbations in the surface buoyancy, which is
influenced by precipitation, evaporation, continental runoff, sea-
ice formation, and the exchange of heat, processes that could all
change with consequences for regional and global climate.
Interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean are also
likely to be of considerable importance on decadal and longer
time-scales, where the THC is involved. The interplay between
the large-scale atmospheric forcing, with warming and
evaporation in low latitudes and cooling and increased precipi-
tation at high latitudes, forms the basis of a potential instability
of the present Atlantic THC. ENSO may also influence the
Atlantic THC by altering the fresh water balance of the tropical
Atlantic, therefore providing a coupling between low and high
latitudes. Uncertainties in the representation of small-scale flows
over sills and through narrow straits and of ocean convection
limit the ability of models to simulate situations involving
substantial changes in the THC. The less saline North Pacific
means that a deep THC does not occur in the Pacific.

Non-linear events and rapid climate change 
The possibility for rapid and irreversible changes in the climate
system exists, but there is a large degree of uncertainty about
the mechanisms involved and hence also about the likelihood
or time-scales of such transitions. The climate system involves
many processes and feedbacks that interact in complex non-
linear ways. This interaction can give rise to thresholds in the
climate system that can be crossed if the system is perturbed
sufficiently. There is evidence from polar ice cores suggesting
that atmospheric regimes can change within a few years and
that large-scale hemispheric changes can evolve as fast as a few
decades. For example, the possibility of a threshold for a rapid
transition of the Atlantic THC to a collapsed state has been

demonstrated with a hierarchy of models. It is not yet clear
what this threshold is and how likely it is that human activity
would lead it to being exceeded (see Section F.6). Atmospheric
circulation can be characterised by different preferred patterns;
e.g., arising from ENSO and the NAO/AO, and changes in their
phase can occur rapidly. Basic theory and models suggest that
climate change may be first expressed in changes in the
frequency of occurrence of these patterns. Changes in
vegetation, through either direct anthropogenic deforestation or
those caused by global warming, could occur rapidly and could
induce further climate change. It is supposed that the rapid
creation of the Sahara about 5,500 years ago represents an
example of such a non-linear change in land cover. 

D.3 Regionalisation Techniques

Regional climate information was only addressed to a limited
degree in the SAR. Techniques used to enhance regional detail
have been substantially improved since the SAR and have
become more widely applied. They fall into three categories:
high and variable resolution AOGCMs; regional (or nested
limited area) climate models (RCMs); and
empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical methods. The
techniques exhibit different strengths and weaknesses and
their use at the continental scale strongly depends on the
needs of specific applications. 

Coarse resolution AOGCMs simulate atmospheric general
circulation features well in general. At the regional scale, the
models display area-average biases that are highly variable
from region to region and among models, with sub-
continental area averaged seasonal temperature biases
typically ±4ºC and precipitation biases between −40 and
+80%. These represent an important improvement compared
to AOGCMs evaluated in the SAR. 

The development of high resolution/variable resolution
Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs) since the
SAR generally shows that the dynamics and large-scale flow
in the models improves as resolution increases. In some
cases, however, systematic errors are worsened compared to
coarser resolution models, although only very few results
have been documented.

High resolution RCMs have matured considerably since the SAR.
Regional models consistently improve the spatial detail of
simulated climate compared to AGCMs. RCMs driven by

53

observed boundary conditions evidence area-averaged
temperature biases (regional scales of 105 to 106 km2) generally
below 2ºC, while precipitation biases are below 50%.
Regionalisation work indicates at finer scales that the changes
can be substantially different in magnitude or sign from the
large area-average results. A relatively large spread exists
among models, although attribution of the cause of these
differences is unclear.

D.4 Overall Assessment of Abilities

Coupled models have evolved and improved significantly since
the SAR. In general, they provide credible simulations of
climate, at least down to sub-continental scales and over
temporal scales from seasonal to decadal. Coupled models, as
a class, are considered to be suitable tools to provide useful
projections of future climates. These models cannot yet
simulate all aspects of climate (e.g., they still cannot account
fully for the observed trend in the surface-troposphere
temperature differences since 1979). Clouds and humidity also
remain sources of significant uncertainty, but there have been
incremental improvements in simulations of these quantities.
No single model can be considered “best”, and it is important
to utilise results from a range of carefully evaluated coupled
models to explore effects of different formulations. The
rationale for increased confidence in models arises from model
performance in the following areas.

Flux adjustment
The overall confidence in model projections is increased by
the improved performance of several models that do not use
flux adjustment. These models now maintain stable, multi-
century simulations of surface climate that are considered to
be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate change
projections. The changes whereby many models can now run
without flux adjustment have come from improvements in
both the atmospheric and oceanic components. In the model
atmosphere, improvements in convection, the boundary layer,
clouds, and surface latent heat fluxes are most notable. In the
model ocean, the improvements are in resolution, boundary
layer mixing, and in the representation of eddies. The results
from climate change studies with flux adjusted and non-flux
adjusted models are broadly in agreement; nonetheless, the
development of stable non-flux adjusted models increases
confidence in their ability to simulate future climates.

Climate of the 20th century
Confidence in the ability of models to project future climates is
increased by the ability of several models to reproduce
warming trends in the 20th century surface air temperature
when driven by increased greenhouse gases and sulphate
aerosols. This is illustrated in Figure 13. However, only
idealized scenarios of sulphate aerosols have been used and
contributions from some additional processes and forcings
may not have been included in the models. Some modelling
studies suggest that inclusion of additional forcings like solar
variability and volcanic aerosols may improve some aspects of
the simulated climate variability of the 20th century. 

Extreme events
Analysis of and confidence in extreme events simulated within
climate models are still emerging, particularly for storm tracks
and storm frequency. “Tropical-cyclone-like” vortices are
being simulated in climate models, although enough
uncertainty remains over their interpretation to warrant caution
in projections of tropical cyclone changes. However, in
general, the analysis of extreme events in both observations
(see Section B.6) and coupled models is underdeveloped.

54

Interannual variability
The performance of coupled models in simulating ENSO has
improved; however, its variability is displaced westward and
its strength is generally underestimated. When suitably
initialised with surface wind and sub-surface ocean data, some
coupled models have had a degree of success in predicting
ENSO events. 

Model intercomparisons
The growth in systematic intercomparisons of models provides
the core evidence for the growing capabilities of climate
models. For example, the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP) is enabling a more comprehensive and
systematic evaluation and intercomparison of coupled models
run in a standardised configuration and responding to
standardised forcing. Some degree of quantification of
improvements in coupled model performance has now been
demonstrated. The Palaeoclimate Model Intercomparison
Project (PMIP) provides intercomparisons of models for the
mid-Holocene (6,000 years before present) and for the Last
Glacial Maximum (21,000 years before present). The ability of
these models to simulate some aspects of palaeoclimates,
compared to a range of palaeoclimate proxy data, gives
confidence in models (at least the atmospheric component)
over a range of difference forcings.

E. The  Identification  of  a  Human
Influence  on  Climate  Chang e

Sections B and C characterised the observed past changes in
climate and in forcing agents, respectively. Section D examined
the capabilities of climate models to predict the response of the
climate system to such changes in forcing. This Section uses
that information to examine the question of whether a human
influence on climate change to date can be identified.

This is an important point to address. The SAR concluded that
“the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible
human influence on global climate”. It noted that the detection
and attribution of anthropogenic climate change signals will be
accomplished through a gradual accumulation of evidence. The
SAR also noted uncertainties in a number of factors, including
internal variability and the magnitude and patterns of forcing
and response, which prevented them from drawing a stronger
conclusion. 

E.1 The  Meaning  of  Detection  and
Attribution 

Detection is the process of demonstrating that an observed
change is significantly different (in a statistical sense) than can
be explained by natural variability. Attribution is the process of
establishing cause and effect with some defined level of
confidence, including the assessment of competing hypotheses.
The response to anthropogenic changes in climate forcing occurs
against a backdrop of natural internal and externally forced
climate variability. Internal climate variability, i.e., climate
variability not forced by external agents, occurs on all time-scales
from weeks to centuries and even millennia. Slow climate
components, such as the ocean, have particularly important roles
on decadal and century time-scales because they integrate
weather variability. Thus, the climate is capable of producing
long time-scale variations of considerable magnitude without
external influences. Externally forced climate variations (signals)
may be due to changes in natural forcing factors, such as solar
radiation or volcanic aerosols, or to changes in anthropogenic
forcing factors, such as increasing concentrations of greenhouse
gases or aerosols. The presence of this natural climate variability
means that the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate
change is a statistical “signal to noise” problem. Detection
studies demonstrate whether or not an observed change is highly
unusual in a statistical sense, but this does not necessarily

55

imply that we understand its causes. The attribution of climate
change to anthropogenic causes involves statistical analysis
and the careful assessment of multiple lines of evidence to
demonstrate, within a pre-specified margin of error, that the
observed changes are:

G unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;

G consistent with the estimated responses to the given

combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing; and 

G not consistent with alternative, physically plausible
explanations of recent climate change that exclude
important elements of the given combination of forcings.

E.2  A  Long er  and  More  Closely  Scrutinised
Obser vational  Record

Three of the last five years (1995, 1997 and 1998) were the
warmest globally in the instrumental record. The impact of
observational sampling errors has been estimated for the
global and hemispheric mean temperature record. There is also
a better understanding of the errors and uncertainties in the
satellite-based (Microwave Sounding Unit, MSU) temperature
record. Discrepancies between MSU and radiosonde data have
largely been resolved, although the observed trend in the
difference between the surface and lower tropospheric 
temperatures cannot fully be accounted for (see Section B).
New reconstructions of temperature over the last 1,000 years
indicate that the temperature changes over the last hundred
years are unlikely to be entirely natural in origin, even taking
into account the large uncertainties in palaeo-reconstructions
(see Section B).

E.3 New Model Estimates of Internal Variability

The warming over the past 100 years is very unlikely to be
due to internal variability alone, as estimated by current
models. The instrumental record is short and covers the period
of human influence and palaeo-records include natural forced
variations, such as those due to variations in solar irradiance
and in the frequency of major volcanic eruptions. These
limitations leave few alternatives to using long “control”
simulations with coupled models for the estimation of internal
climate variability. Since the SAR, more models have been
used to estimate the magnitude of internal climate variability,
a representative sample of which is given in Figure 14. As can
be seen, there is a wide range of global scale internal

variability in these models. Estimates of the longer time-scale
variability relevant to detection and attribution studies is
uncertain, but, on interannual and decadal time-scales, some
models show similar or larger variability than observed, even
though models do not include variance from external sources.
Conclusions on detection of an anthropogenic signal are
insensitive to the model used to estimate internal variability,
and recent changes cannot be accounted for as pure internal
variability, even if the amplitude of simulated internal
variations is increased by a factor of two or perhaps more.
Most recent detection and attribution studies find no evidence
that model-estimated internal variability at the surface is
inconsistent with the residual variability that remains in the
observations after removal of the estimated anthropogenic
signals on the large spatial and long time-scales used in
detection and attribution studies. Note, however, the ability to
detect inconsistencies is limited. As Figure 14 indicates, no
model control simulation shows a trend in surface air
temperature as large as the observed trend over the last 1,000
years.

year control simulations with three different climate models, – Hadley,

the recent instrumental record. No model control simulation shows a
trend in surface air temperature as large as the observed trend. If
internal variability is correct in these models, the recent warming is
likely not due to variability produced within the climate system alone.
[Based on Figure 12.1]

56

E.4  New  Estimates  of  Responses  to  Natural
Forcing

Assessments based on physical principles and model
simulations indicate that natural forcing alone is unlikely to
explain the recent observed global warming or the observed
changes in vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere.
Fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models have used
reconstructions of solar and volcanic forcings over the last one
to three centuries to estimate the contribution of natural forcing
to climate variability and change. Although the reconstruction
of natural forcings is uncertain, including their effects produces
an increase in variance at longer (multi-decadal) time-scales.
This brings the low-frequency variability closer to that deduced
from palaeo-reconstructions. It is likely that the net natural
forcing (i.e., solar plus volcanic) has been negative over the
past two decades, and possibly even the past four decades.
Statistical assessments confirm that simulated natural
variability, both internal and naturally forced, is unlikely to
explain the warming in the latter half of the 20th century (see
Figure 15). However, there is evidence for a detectable volcanic
influence on climate and evidence that suggests a detectable
solar influence, especially in the early part of the 20th century.
Even if the models underestimate the magnitude of the
response to solar or volcanic forcing, the spatial and temporal
patterns are such that these effects alone cannot explain the
observed temperature changes over the 20th century.

E.5  Sensitivity  to  Estimates  of  Climate
Chang e  Signals

There is a wide range of evidence of qualitative consistencies
between observed climate changes and model responses to
anthropogenic forcing. Models and observations show
increasing global temperature, increasing land-ocean
temperature contrast, diminishing sea-ice extent, glacial
retreat, and increases in precipitation at high latitudes in the
Northern Hemisphere. Some qualitative inconsistencies
remain, including the fact that models predict a faster rate of
warming in the mid- to upper troposphere than is observed in
either satellite or radiosonde tropospheric temperature records. 

All simulations with greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols
that have been used in detection studies have found that a
significant anthropogenic contribution is required to account
for surface and tropospheric trends over at least the last 30
years. Since the SAR, more simulations with increases in

greenhouse gases and some representation of aerosol effects
have become available. Several studies have included an
explicit representation of greenhouse gases (as opposed to an
equivalent increase in CO2). Some have also included tropos-
pheric ozone changes, an interactive sulphur cycle, an explicit
radiative treatment of the scattering of sulphate aerosols, and
improved estimates of the changes in stratospheric ozone.
Overall, while detection of the climate response to these other
anthropogenic factors is often ambiguous, detection of the
influence of greenhouse gases on the surface temperature
changes over the past 50 years is robust. In some cases,
ensembles of simulations have been run to reduce noise in the
estimates of the time-dependent response. Some studies have
evaluated seasonal variation of the response. Uncertainties in
the estimated climate change signals have made it difficult to
attribute the observed climate change to one specific
combination of anthropogenic and natural influences, but all
studies have found a significant anthropogenic contribution is
required to account for surface and tropospheric trends over at
least the last thirty years.

E.6  A Wider  Rang e  of  Detection Techniques

Temperature
Evidence of a human influence on climate is obtained over a
substantially wider range of detection techniques. A major
advance since the SAR is the increase in the range of
techniques used and the evaluation of the degree to which the
results are independent of the assumptions made in applying
those techniques. There have been studies using pattern
correlations, optimal detection studies using one or more fixed
patterns and time-varying patterns, and a number of other
techniques. The increase in the number of studies, breadth of
techniques, increased rigour in the assessment of the role of
anthropogenic forcing in climate, and the robustness of results
to the assumptions made using those techniques, has increased
the confidence in these aspects of detection and attribution. 

Results are sensitive to the range of temporal and spatial scales
that are considered. Several decades of data are necessary to
separate forced signals from internal variability. Idealised
studies have demonstrated that surface temperature changes are
detectable only on scales in the order of 5,000 km. Such studies
show that the level of agreement found between simulations
and observations in pattern correlation studies is close to what
one would expect in theory.

Figure 15: Global mean surface temperature anomalies relative to the 1880 to 1920 mean from the instrumental record compared with ensembles
of four simulations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model forced (a) with solar and volcanic forcing only, (b) with anthropogenic forcing
including well mixed greenhouse gases, changes in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone and the direct and indirect effects of sulphate aerosols,
and (c) with all forcings, both natural and anthropogenic. The thick line shows the instrumental data while the thin lines show the individual model
simulations in the ensemble of four members. Note that the data are annual mean values. The model data are only sampled at the locations where
there are observations. The changes in sulphate aerosol are calculated interactively, and changes in tropospheric ozone were calculated offline
using a chemical transport model. Changes in cloud brightness (the first indirect effect of sulphate aerosols) were calculated by an off line
simulation and included in the model. The changes in stratospheric ozone were based on observations. The volcanic and solar forcing were based
on published combinations of measured and proxy data. The net anthropogenic forcing at 1990 was 1.0 Wm−2 including a net cooling of 1.0 Wm−2
due to sulphate aerosols. The net natural forcing for 1990 relative to 1860 was 0.5 Wm−2, and for 1992 was a net cooling of 2.0 Wm−2 due to
Mount Pinatubo. Other models forced with anthropogenic forcing give similar results to those shown in (b). [Based on Figure 12.7]

Most attribution studies find that, over the last 50 years, the
estimated rate and magnitude of global warming due to
increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases alone are
comparable with or larger than the observed warming.
Attribution studies address the question of “whether the
magnitude of the simulated response to a particular forcing
agent is consistent with observations”. The use of multi-signal
techniques has enabled studies that discriminate between the
effects of different factors on climate. The inclusion of the
time dependence of signals has helped to distinguish between
natural and anthropogenic forcings. As more response patterns
are included, the problem of degeneracy (different
combinations of patterns yielding near identical fits to the
observations) inevitably arises. Nevertheless, even with all the
major responses that have been included in the analysis, a
distinct greenhouse gas signal remains detectable.
Furthermore, most model estimates that take into account both
greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols are consistent with
observations over this period. The best agreement between
model simulations and observations over the last 140 years is
found when both anthropogenic and natural factors are
included (see Figure 15). These results show that the forcings
included are sufficient to explain the observed changes, but do
not exclude the possibility that other forcings have also
contributed. Overall, the magnitude of the temperature
response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is
found to be consistent with observations on the scales
considered (see Figure 16), but there remain discrepies
between modelled and observed response to other natural and
anthropogenic factors. 

Uncertainties in other forcings that have been included do not
prevent identification of the effect of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases over the last 50 years. The sulphate forcing,
while uncertain, is negative over this period. Changes in
natural forcing during most of this period are also estimated to
be negative. Detection of the influence of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases therefore cannot be eliminated either by the
uncertainty in sulphate aerosol forcing or because natural
forcing has not been included in all model simulations. Studies
that distinguish the separate responses to greenhouse gas,
sulphate aerosol and natural forcing produce uncertain
estimates of the amplitude of the sulphate aerosol and natural
signals, but almost all studies are nevertheless able to detect
the presence of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas signal in the
recent climate record.

The detection and attribution methods used should not be
sensitive to errors in the amplitude of the global mean
response to individual forcings. In the signal-estimation
methods used in this report, the amplitude of the signal is
estimated from the observations and not the amplitude of the
simulated response. Hence the estimates are independent of
those factors determining the simulated amplitude of the
response, such as the climate sensitivity of the model used. In
addition, if the signal due to a given forcing is estimated
individually, the amplitude is largely independent of the
magnitude of the forcing used to derive the response.
Uncertainty in the amplitude of the solar and indirect sulphate
aerosol forcing should not affect the magnitude of the
estimated signal.

Sea  level
It is very likely that the 20th century warming has contributed
significantly to the observed sea level rise, through thermal
expansion of sea water and widespread loss of land ice.
Within present uncertainties, observations and models are both
consistent with a lack of significant acceleration of sea level
rise during the 20th century.

E.7  Remaining  Uncer tainties  in  Detection
and  Attribution

Some progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, though
many of the sources of uncertainty identified in the SAR still
exist. These include:

G Discrepancies between the vertical profile of temperature

change in the troposphere seen in observations and models.
These have been reduced as more realistic forcing histories
have been used in models, although not fully resolved.
Also, the difference between observed surface and 
lower-tropospheric trends over the last two decades cannot
be fully reproduced by model simulations.

G Large uncertainties in estimates of internal climate

variability from models and observations. Although as
noted above, these are unlikely (bordering on very unlikely)
to be large enough to nullify the claim that a detectable
climate change has taken place. 

G Considerable uncertainty in the reconstructions of solar
and volcanic forcing which are based on proxy or limited
observational data for all but the last two decades.

Figure 16: (a) Estimates of the “scaling factors” by which the amplitude of several model-simulated signals must be multiplied to reproduce
the corresponding changes in the observed record. The vertical bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal variability. A
range encompassing unity implies that this combination of forcing amplitude and model-simulated response is consistent with the
corresponding observed change, while a range encompassing zero implies that this model-simulated signal is not detectable. Signals are
defined as the ensemble mean response to external forcing expressed in large-scale (>5,000 km) near-surface temperatures over the 1946 to
1996 period relative to the 1896 to 1996 mean. The first entry (G) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence interval obtained with the
assumption that the observations consist only of a response to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. The range is significantly less than
one (consistent with results from other models), meaning that models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly over predict the
observed warming signal. The next eight entries show scaling factors for model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing
(GS), with two cases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, one of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion
(GSI and GSIO, respectively). All but one (CGCM1) of these ranges is consistent with unity. Hence there is little evidence that models are

60

appears to be robust to possible amplification of the solar
forcing by ozone-solar or solar-cloud interactions, provided
these do not alter the pattern or time-dependence of the
response to solar forcing. Amplification of the solar signal
by these processes, which are not yet included in models,
remains speculative. 

G Large uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing are associated

with the effects of aerosols. The effects of some anthro-
pogenic factors, including organic carbon, black carbon,
biomass aerosols, and changes in land use, have not been
included in detection and attribution studies. Estimates of
the size and geographic pattern of the effects of these
forcings vary considerably, although individually their
global effects are estimated to be relatively small.

G Large differences in the response of different models to the

same forcing. These differences, which are often greater
than the difference in response in the same model with and
without aerosol effects, highlight the large uncertainties in
climate change prediction and the need to quantify
uncertainty and reduce it through better observational data
sets and model improvement. 

E.8  Synopsis

In the light of new evidence and taking into account the
remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over
the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in
greenhouse gas concentrations. 

systematically over- or under predicting the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption that model-simulated GS signals and
internal variability are an adequate representation (i.e., that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). Observed residual
variability is consistent with this assumption in all but one case (ECHAM3, indicated by the asterisk). One is obliged to make this assumption
to include models for which only a simulation of the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single signal
cases are incomplete since they do not account for uncertainty in the naturally forced response. These ranges indicate, however, the high
level of confidence with which internal variability, as simulated by these various models, can be rejected as an explanation of recent near-
surface temperature change. A more complete uncertainty analysis is provided by the next three entries, which show corresponding scaling
factors on individual greenhouse (G), sulphate (S), solar-plus-volcanic (N), solar-only (So) and volcanic-only (V) signals for those cases in
which the relevant simulations have been performed.  In these cases, multiple factors are estimated simultaneously to account for uncertainty
in the amplitude of the naturally forced response. The uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. In
one case (ECHAM3) the model appears to be overestimating the greenhouse response (scaling range in the G signal inconsistent with unity),
but this result is sensitive to which component of the control is used to define the detection space.  It is also not known how it would respond
to the inclusion of a volcanic signal. In cases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (HadCM2 and HadCM3), G and S signals
remain detectable and consistent with unity independent of whether natural signals are estimated jointly or separately (allowing for different
errors in S and V responses).

(b) Estimated contributions to global mean warming over the 20th century, based on the results shown in (a), with 5 to 95% confidence
intervals. Although the estimates vary depending on which model's signal and what forcing is assumed, and are less certain if more than one
signal is estimated, all show a significant contribution from anthropogenic climate change to 20th century warming. [Based on Figure 12.12]

F. The  Projections  of  the  Ear th’s
Future  Climate

The tools of climate models are used with future scenarios of
forcing agents (e.g., greenhouse gases and aerosols) as input
to make a suite of projected future climate changes that
illustrates the possibilities that could lie ahead. Section F.1
provides a description of the future scenarios of forcing
agents given in the IPCC Special Report on Emission
Scenarios (SRES) on which, wherever possible, the future
changes presented in this section are based. Sections F.2 to
F.9 present the resulting projections of changes to the future
climate. Finally, Section F.10 presents the results of future
projections based on scenarios of a future where greenhouse
gas concentrations are stabilised.

F.1 The IPCC Special Report on Emissions
Scenarios (SRES)

In 1996, the IPCC began the development of a new set of
emissions scenarios, effectively to update and replace the 
well-known IS92 scenarios. The approved new set of
scenarios is described in the IPCC Special Report on
Emission Scenarios (SRES). Four different narrative
storylines were developed to describe consistently the
relationships between the forces driving emissions and their
evolution and to add context for the scenario quantification.
The resulting set of 40 scenarios (35 of which contain data
on the full range of gases required to force climate models)
cover a wide range of the main demographic, economic and
technological driving forces of future greenhouse gas and
sulphur emissions. Each scenario represents a specific
quantification of one of the four storylines. All the scenarios
based on the same storyline constitute a scenario “family”
(See Box 5, which briefly describes the main characteristics
of the four SRES storylines and scenario families). The
SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives,
which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly
assume implementation of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change or the emissions targets of
the Kyoto Protocol. However, greenhouse gas emissions are
directly affected by non-climate change policies designed for
a wide range of other purposes (e.g., air quality).
Furthermore, government policies can, to varying degrees,
influence the greenhouse gas emission drivers, such as

demographic change, social and economic development,
technological change, resource use, and pollution
management. This influence is broadly reflected in the
storylines and resulting scenarios.

Since the SRES was not approved until 15 March 2000, it
was too late for the modelling community to incorporate the
final approved scenarios in their models and have the results
available in time for this Third Assessment Report. However,
draft scenarios were released to climate modellers earlier to
facilitate their input to the Third Assessment Report, in
accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998. At
that time, one marker scenario was chosen from each of four
of the scenario groups based directly on the storylines (A1B,
A2, B1, and B2). The choice of the markers was based on
which of the initial quantifications best reflected the storyline
and features of specific models. Marker scenarios are no
more or less likely than any other scenarios, but are
considered illustrative of a particular storyline. Scenarios
were also selected later to illustrate the other two scenario
groups (A1FI and A1T) within the A1 family, which specif-
ically explore alternative technology developments, holding
the other driving forces constant. Hence there is an
illustrative scenario for each of the six scenario groups, and
all are equally plausible. Since the latter two illustrative
scenarios were selected at a late stage in the process, the
AOGCM modelling results presented in this report only use
two of the four draft marker scenarios. At present, only
scenarios A2 and B2 have been integrated by more than one
AOGCM. The AOGCM results have been augmented by
results from simple climate models that cover all six
illustrative scenarios. The IS92a scenario is also presented in
a number of cases to provide direct comparison with the
results presented in the SAR.

The final four marker scenarios contained in the SRES differ
in minor ways from the draft scenarios used for the AOGCM
experiments described in this report. In order to ascertain the
likely effect of differences in the draft and final SRES
scenarios, each of the four draft and final marker scenarios
were studied using a simple climate model. For three of the
four marker scenarios (A1B, A2, and B2) temperature
change from the draft and marker scenarios are very similar.
The primary difference is a change to the standardised
values for 1990 to 2000, which is common to all these
scenarios. This results in a higher forcing early in the period.

62

Box  5: The  Emissions
Scenarios  of  the  Special
Repor t  on  Emissions
Scenarios  (SRES)
A1. The A1 storyline and scenario
family describes a future world of very
rapid economic growth, global
population that peaks in mid-century
and declines thereafter, and the rapid
introduction of new and more efficient
technologies. Major underlying themes
are convergence among regions,
capacity building and increased
cultural and social interactions, with a
substantial reduction in regional
differences in per capita income. The
A1 scenario family develops into three
groups that describe alternative
directions of technological change in
the energy system. The three A1
groups are distinguished by their
technological emphasis: fossil
intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy
sources (A1T), or a balance across all
sources (A1B) (where balanced is

defined as not relying too heavily on
one particular energy source, on the
assumption that similar improvement
rates apply to all energy supply and
end-use technologies).

A2. The A2 storyline and scenario
family describes a very heterogeneous
world. The underlying theme is self-
reliance and preservation of local
identities. Fertility patterns across
regions converge very slowly, which
results in continuously increasing
population. Economic development is
primarily regionally oriented and per
capita economic growth and techno-
logical change more fragmented and
slower than other storylines.

B1. The B1 storyline and scenario
family describes a convergent world
with the same global population, that
peaks in mid-century and declines
thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but
with rapid change in economic

structures toward a service and
information economy, with reductions
in material intensity and the
introduction of clean and resource-
efficient technologies. The emphasis is
on global solutions to economic, social
and environmental sustainability,
including improved equity, but without
additional climate initiatives.

B2. The B2 storyline and scenario
family describes a world in which the
emphasis is on local solutions to
economic, social and environmental
sustainability. It is a world with
continuously increasing global
population, at a rate lower than A2,
intermediate levels of economic
development, and less rapid and more
diverse technological change than in
the A1 and B1 storylines. While the
scenario is also oriented towards
environmental protection and social
equity, it focuses on local and regional
levels.

There are further small differences in net forcing, but these
decrease until, by 2100, differences in temperature change in
the two versions of these scenarios are in the range 1 to 2%.
For the B1 scenario, however, temperature change is signifi-
cantly lower in the final version, leading to a difference in
the temperature change in 2100 of almost 20%, as a result of
generally lower emissions across the full range of
greenhouse gases.

Anthropogenic emissions of the three main greenhouse
gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O, together with anthropogenic
sulphur dioxide emissions, are shown for the six illustrative
SRES scenarios in Figure 17. It is evident that these
scenarios encompass a wide range of emissions. For
comparison, emissions are also shown for IS92a. Particularly
noteworthy are the much lower future sulphur dioxide
emissions for the six SRES scenarios, compared to the IS92
scenarios, due to structural changes in the energy system as
well as concerns about local and regional air pollution.

F.2    Projections  of  Future  Chang es  in
Greenhouse  Gases  and  Aerosols

Models indicate that the illustrative SRES scenarios lead to very
different CO2 concentration trajectories (see Figure 18). By
2100, carbon cycle models project atmospheric CO2 concen-
trations of 540 to 970 ppm for the illustrative SRES scenarios
(90 to 250% above the concentration of 280 ppm in 1750). The
net effect of land and ocean climate feedbacks as indicated by
models is to further increase projected atmospheric CO2 concen-
trations by reducing both the ocean and land uptake of CO2.
These projections include the land and ocean climate feedbacks.
Uncertainties, especially about the magnitude of the climate
feedback from the terrestrial biosphere, cause a variation of
about −10 to +30% around each scenario. The total range is 490
to 1260 ppm (75 to 350% above the 1750 concentration).

Measures to enhance carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems
could influence atmospheric CO2 concentration, but the upper
bound for reduction of CO2 concentration by such means is 40

to 70 ppm. If all the carbon released by historic land-use
changes could be restored to the terrestrial biosphere over the
course of the century (e.g., by reforestation), CO2 concentration
would be reduced by 40 to 70 ppm. Thus, fossil fuel CO2
emissions are virtually certain to remain the dominant control
over trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration during this
century.

Model calculations of the abundances of the primary non-CO2
greenhouse gases by the year 2100 vary considerably across

the six illustrative SRES scenarios. In general A1B, A1T and
B1 have the smallest increases, and A1FI and A2, the largest.
The CH4 changes from 1998 to 2100 range from −190 to
+1970 ppb (−11 to +112%), and N2O increases from +38 to
+144 ppb (+12 to +46%) (see Figures 17b and c). The HFCs
(134a, 143a, and 125) reach abundances of a few hundred to a
thousand ppt from negligible levels today. The PFC CF4 is
projected to increase to 200 to 400 ppt, and SF6 is projected to
increase to 35 to 65 ppt.

Figure 18: Atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O resulting
from the six SRES scenarios and from the IS92a scenario computed
with current methodology. [Based on Figures 3.12 and 4.14]

For the six illustrative SRES emissions scenarios, projected
emissions of indirect greenhouse gases (NOx, CO, VOC),
together with changes in CH4, are projected to change the
global mean abundance of the tropospheric hydroxyl radical
(OH), by −20% to +6% over the next century. Because of the
importance of OH in tropospheric chemistry, comparable, but
opposite sign, changes occur in the atmospheric lifetimes of
the greenhouse gases CH4 and HFCs. This impact depends in
large part on the magnitude of and the balance between NOx
and CO emissions. Changes in tropospheric O3 of –12 to +62%
are calculated from 2000 until 2100. The largest increase
predicted for the 21st century is for scenarios A1FI and A2
and would be more than twice as large as that experienced
since the Pre-industrial Era. These O3 increases are attributable
to the concurrent and large increases in anthropogenic NOx
and CH4 emissions.
The large growth in emissions of greenhouse gases and other
pollutants as projected in some of the six illustrative SRES
scenarios for the 21st century will degrade the global
environment in ways beyond climate change. Changes
projected in the SRES A2 and A1FI scenarios would degrade
air quality over much of the globe by increasing background
levels of tropospheric O3. In northern mid-latitudes during
summer, the zonal average of O3 increases near the surface
are about 30 ppb or more, raising background levels to about
80 ppb, threatening the attainment of current air quality
standards over most metropolitan and even rural regions and
compromising crop and forest productivity. This problem
reaches across continental boundaries and couples emissions
of NOx on a hemispheric scale.
Except for sulphate and black carbon, models show an 
approximately linear dependence of the abundance of
aerosols on emissions. The processes that determine the
removal rate for black carbon differ substantially between the
models, leading to major uncertainty in the future projections
of black carbon. Emissions of natural aerosols such as sea
salt, dust, and gas phase precursors of aerosols such as
terpenes, sulphur dioxide (SO2), and dimethyl sulphide
oxidation may increase as a result of changes in climate and
atmospheric chemistry.

of forcing that results from the full set of SRES scenarios.

SRES scenarios are shown in
Figure 19. The forcing from the
full range of 35 SRES scenarios
is shown on the figure as a
shaded envelope, since the
forcings resulting from
individual scenarios cross with
time. The direct forcing from
biomass-burning aerosols is
scaled with deforestation rates.
The SRES scenarios include the
possibility of either increases or
decreases in anthropogenic
aerosols (e.g., sulphate aerosols,
biomass aerosols, and black and
organic carbon aerosols),
depending on the extent of
fossil fuel use and policies to
abate polluting emissions. The
SRES scenarios do not include
emissions estimates for non-
sulphate aerosols. Two methods
for projecting these emissions
were considered in this report:
the first scales the emissions of
fossil fuel and biomass aerosols
with CO while the second
scales the emissions with SO2
and deforestation. Only the
second method was used for
climate projections. For
comparison, radiative forcing is also shown for the IS92a
scenario. It is evident that the range for the new SRES
scenarios is shifted higher compared to the IS92 scenarios.
This is mainly due to the reduced future SO2 emissions of the
SRES scenarios compared to the IS92 scenarios, but also to
the slightly larger cumulative carbon emissions featured in
some SRES scenarios.

In almost all SRES scenarios, the radiative forcing due to
CO2, CH4, N2O and tropospheric O3 continue to increase,
with the fraction of the total radiative forcing due to CO2
projected to increase from slightly more than half to about

three-quarters of the total. The radiative forcing due to O3-
depleting gases decreases due to the introduction of emission
controls aimed at curbing stratospheric ozone depletion. The
direct aerosol (sulphate and black and organic carbon
components taken together) radiative forcing (evaluated
relative to present day, 2000) varies in sign for the different
scenarios. The direct plus indirect aerosol effects are projected
to be smaller in magnitude than that of CO2. No estimates are
made for the spatial aspects of the future forcings. The indirect
effect of aerosols on clouds is included in simple climate model
calculations and scaled non-linearly with SO2 emissions,
assuming a present day value of –0.8 Wm−2, as in the SAR.

AOGCM  results 
Climate sensitivity is likely to be in the range of 1.5 to 4.5°C.
This estimate is unchanged from the first IPCC Assessment
Report in 1990 and the SAR. The climate sensitivity is the
equilibrium response of global surface temperature to a doubling
of equivalent CO2 concentration. The range of estimates arises
from uncertainties in the climate models and their internal
feedbacks, particularly those related to clouds and related
processes. Used for the first time in this IPCC report is the
Transient Climate Response (TCR). The TCR is defined as the
globally averaged surface air temperature change, at the time of
doubling of CO2, in a 1%/yr CO2-increase experiment. This rate
of CO2 increase is assumed to represent the radiative forcing
from all greenhouse gases. The TCR combines elements of
model sensitivity and factors that affect response (e.g., ocean
heat uptake). The range of the TCR for current AOGCMs is 1.1
to 3.1°C. 

Including the direct effect of sulphate aerosols reduces global
mean mid-21st century warming. The surface temperature
response pattern for a given model, with and without sulphate
aerosols, is more similar than the pattern between two models
using the same forcing. 

Models project changes in several broad-scale climate variables.
As the radiative forcing of the climate system changes, the land
warms faster and more than the ocean, and there is greater
relative warming at high latitudes. Models project a smaller
surface air temperature increase in the North Atlantic and
circumpolar southern ocean regions relative to the global mean.
There is projected to be a decrease in diurnal temperature range
in many areas, with night-time lows increasing more than
daytime highs. A number of models show a general decrease of
daily variability of surface air temperature in winter and
increased daily variability in summer in the Northern
Hemisphere land areas. As the climate warms, the Northern
Hemisphere snow cover and sea-ice extent are projected to
decrease. Many of these changes are consistent with recent
observational trends, as noted in Section B.

Multi-model ensembles of AOGCM simulations for a range of
scenarios are being used to quantify the mean climate change
and uncertainty based on the range of model results. For the end
of the 21st century (2071 to 2100), the mean change in global

average surface air temperature, relative to the period 1961 to
1990, is 3.0°C (with a range of 1.3 to 4.5°C) for the A2 draft
marker scenario and 2.2°C (with a range of 0.9 to 3.4°C) for the
B2 draft marker scenario. The B2 scenario produces a smaller
warming that is consistent with its lower rate of increased CO2
concentration.

On time-scales of a few decades, the current observed rate of
warming can be used to constrain the projected response to a
given emissions scenario despite uncertainty in climate
sensitivity. Analysis of simple models and intercomparisons of
AOGCM responses to idealised forcing scenarios suggest that,
for most scenarios over the coming decades, errors in large-scale
temperature projections are likely to increase in proportion to the
magnitude of the overall response. The estimated size of and
uncertainty in current observed warming rates attributable to
human influence thus provides a relatively model-independent
estimate of uncertainty in multi-decade projections under most
scenarios. To be consistent with recent observations, anthro-
pogenic warming is likely to lie in the range 0.1 to 0.2°C/decade
over the next few decades under the IS92a scenario. This is
similar to the range of responses to this scenario based on the
seven versions of the simple model used in Figure 22.

Most of the features of the geographical response in the SRES
scenario experiments are similar for different scenarios (see
Figure 20) and are similar to those for idealised 1% CO2-
increase integrations. The biggest difference between the 1%
CO2-increase experiments, which have no sulphate aerosol, and
the SRES experiments is the regional moderating of the warming
over industrialised areas, in the SRES experiments, where the
negative forcing from sulphate aerosols is greatest. This regional
effect was noted in the SAR for only two models, but this has
now been shown to be a consistent response across the greater
number of more recent models. 

It is very likely that nearly all land areas will warm more rapidly
than the global average, particularly those at northern high
latitudes in the cold season. Results (see Figure 21) from recent
AOGCM simulations forced with SRES A2 and B2 emissions
scenarios indicate that in winter the warming for all high-latitude
northern regions exceeds the global mean warming in each
model by more than 40% (1.3 to 6.3°C for the range of models
and scenarios considered). In summer, warming is in excess of
40% above the global mean change in central and northern Asia.
Only in south Asia and southern South America in June/July/
August, and Southeast Asia for both seasons, do the models
consistently show warming less than the global average.

Simple  climate  model  results
Due to computational expense, AOGCMs can only be run for a
limited number of scenarios. A simple model can be calibrated
to represent globally averaged AOGCM responses and run for
a much larger number of scenarios.

The globally averaged surface temperature is projected to
increase by 1.4 to 5.8°C (Figure 22(a)) over the period 1990 to
2100. These results are for the full range of 35 SRES scenarios,
based on a number of climate models.6,7 Temperature increases
are projected to be greater than those in the SAR, which were
about 1.0 to 3.5°C based on six IS92 scenarios. The higher

projected temperatures and the wider range are due primarily to
the lower projected SO2 emissions in the SRES scenarios
relative to the IS92 scenarios. The projected rate of warming is
much larger than the observed changes during the 20th century
and is very likely to be without precedent during at least the
last 10,000 years, based on palaeoclimate data.

The relative ranking of the SRES scenarios in terms of global
mean temperature changes with time. In particular, for
scenarios with higher fossil fuel use (hence, higher carbon
dioxide emissions, e.g., A2), the SO2 emissions are also
higher. In the near term (to around 2050), the cooling effect of

6 Complex physically based climate models are the main tool for projecting future climate change. In order to explore the range of scenarios, these are 

complemented by simple climate models calibrated to yield an equivalent response in temperature and sea level to complex climate models. These 
projections are obtained using a simple climate model whose climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake are calibrated to each of 7 complex climate 
models. The climate sensitivity used in the simple model ranges from 1.7 to 4.2°C, which is comparable to the commonly accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C.

7 This range does not include uncertainties in the modelling of radiative forcing, e.g. aerosol forcing uncertainties. A small carbon cycle climate feedback is included.

on warming greater than the global average (‘Greater than average warming’), agreement on warming less than the global average (‘Less than

also a category for agreement on cooling (which never occurs). A consistent result from at least seven of the nine models is deemed necessary for
agreement. The global annual average warming of the models used span 1.2 to 4.5°C for A2 and 0.9 to 3.4°C for B2, and therefore a regional 40%
amplification represents warming ranges of 1.7 to 6.3°C for A2 and 1.3 to 4.7°C for B2. [Based on Chapter 10, Box 1, Figure 1]

higher sulphur dioxide emissions significantly reduces the
warming caused by increased emissions of greenhouse gases
in scenarios such as A2. The opposite effect is seen for
scenarios B1 and B2, which have lower fossil fuel emissions
as well as lower SO2 emissions, and lead to a larger near-
term warming. In the longer term, however, the level of
emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases such as CO2 and
N2O become the dominant determinants of the resulting
climate changes. 

By 2100, differences in emissions in the SRES scenarios and
different climate model responses contribute similar
uncertainty to the range of global temperature change.
Further uncertainties arise due to uncertainties in the
radiative forcing. The largest forcing uncertainty is that due
to the sulphate aerosols. 

F.4  Projections of Future Changes in Precipitation 

Globally averaged water vapour, evaporation and precipi-
tation are projected to increase. At the regional scale both
increases and decreases in precipitation are seen. Results
(see Figure 23) from recent AOGCM simulations forced with
SRES A2 and B2 emissions scenarios indicate that it is likely
for precipitation to increase in both summer and winter over
high-latitude regions. In winter, increases are also seen over
northern mid-latitudes, tropical Africa and Antarctica, and in
summer in southern and eastern Asia. Australia, central
America, and southern Africa show consistent decreases in
winter rainfall. 

Based on patterns emerging from a limited number of studies
with current AOGCMs, older GCMs, and regionalisation
studies, there is a strong correlation between precipitation

increases in mean precipitation will likely lead to increases
in variability. Conversely, precipitation variability will likely
decrease only in areas of reduced mean precipitation.

F.5  Projections  of  Future  Chang es  in
Extreme  Events 

It is only recently that changes in extremes of weather and
climate observed to date have been compared to changes
projected by models (Table 4). More hot days and heat waves
are very likely over nearly all land areas. These increases are
projected to be largest mainly in areas where soil moisture
decreases occur. Increases in daily minimum temperature are

projected to occur over nearly all land areas and are generally
larger where snow and ice retreat. Frost days and cold waves
are very likely to become fewer. The changes in surface air
temperature and surface absolute humidity are projected to
result in increases in the heat index (which is a measure of the
combined effects of temperature and moisture). The increases
in surface air temperature are also projected to result in an
increase in the “cooling degree days” (which is a measure of
the amount of cooling required on a given day once the
temperature exceeds a given threshold) and a decrease in
“heating degree days”. Precipitation extremes are projected to
increase more than the mean and the intensity of precipitation
events are projected to increase. The frequency of extreme

confidence in observed changes in extremes of weather and climate during the latter half of the 20th century (left column) and in projected
changes during the 21st century (right column)a. This assessment relies on observational and modelling studies, as well as physical plausibility of
future projections across all commonly used scenarios and is based on expert judgement (see Footnote 4). [Based upon Table 9.6]

precipitation events is projected to increase almost
everywhere. There is projected to be a general drying of the
mid-continental areas during summer. This is ascribed to a
combination of increased temperature and potential
evaporation that is not balanced by increases of precipitation.
There is little agreement yet among models concerning future
changes in mid-latitude storm intensity, frequency, and
variability. There is little consistent evidence that shows
changes in the projected frequency of tropical cyclones and
areas of formation. However, some measures of intensities
show projected increases, and some theoretical and modelling
studies suggest that the upper limit of these intensities could
increase. Mean and peak precipitation intensities from tropical
cyclones are likely to increase appreciably. 

For some other extreme phenomena, many of which may have
important impacts on the environment and society, there is
currently insufficient information to assess recent trends, and
confidence in models and understanding is inadequate to make
firm projections. In particular, very small-scale phenomena
such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, and lightning are not
simulated in global models. Insufficient analysis has occurred
of how extra-tropical cyclones may change.

F.6  Projections  of  Future  Chang es  in
Thermohaline  Circulation

Most models show weakening of the Northern Hemisphere
Thermohaline Circulation (THC), which contributes to a
reduction of the surface warming in the northern North
Atlantic. Even in models where the THC weakens, there is still
a warming over Europe due to increased greenhouse gases. In
experiments where the atmospheric greenhouse gas concen-
tration is stabilised at twice its present day value, the North
Atlantic THC is projected to recover from initial weakening
within one to several centuries. The THC could collapse
entirely in either hemisphere if the rate of change in radiative
forcing is large enough and applied long enough. Models
indicate that a decrease of the THC reduces its resilience to
perturbations, i.e., a once reduced THC appears to be less
stable and a shut-down can become more likely. However, it is
too early to say with confidence whether an irreversible
collapse in the THC is likely or not, or at what threshold it
might occur and what the climate implications could be. None
of the current projections with coupled models exhibits a
complete shut-down of the THC by 2100. Although the North

Atlantic THC weakens in most models, the relative roles of
surface heat and fresh water fluxes vary from model to model.
Wind stress changes appear to play only a minor role in the
transient response. 

F.7  Projections  of  Future  Chang es  in
Modes  of  Natural Variability

Many models show a mean El Niño-like response in the
tropical Pacific, with the central and eastern equatorial Pacific
sea surface temperatures projected to warm more than the
western equatorial Pacific and with a corresponding mean
eastward shift of precipitation. Although many models show an
El Niño-like change of the mean state of tropical Pacific sea
surface temperatures, the cause is uncertain. It has been related
to changes in the cloud radiative forcing and/or evaporative
damping of the east-west sea surface temperature gradient in
some models. Confidence in projections of changes in future
frequency, amplitude, and spatial pattern of El Niño events in
the tropical Pacific is tempered by some shortcomings in how
well El Niño is simulated in complex models. Current
projections show little change or a small increase in amplitude
for El Niño events over the next 100 years. However, even with
little or no change in El Niño amplitude, global warming is
likely to lead to greater extremes of drying and heavy rainfall
and increase the risk of droughts and floods that occur with El
Niño events in many regions. It also is likely that warming
associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will
cause an increase of Asian summer monsoon precipitation
variability. Changes in monsoon mean duration and strength
depend on the details of the emission scenario. The confidence
in such projections is limited by how well the climate models
simulate the detailed seasonal evolution of the monsoons.
There is no clear agreement on changes in frequency or
structure of naturally occurring modes of variability, such as
the North Atlantic Oscillation, i.e., the magnitude and character
of the changes vary across the models.

F.8  Projections  of  Future  Chang es  in  Land
Ice  (Glaciers, Ice  Caps  and  Ice  Sheets),
Sea  Ice  and  Snow  Cover

Glaciers and ice caps will continue their widespread retreat
during the 21st century and Northern Hemisphere snow cover
and sea ice are projected to decrease further. Methods have
been developed recently for estimating glacier melt from

73

seasonally and geographically dependent patterns of surface
air temperature change, that are obtained from AOGCM
experiments. Modelling studies suggest that the evolution of
glacial mass is controlled principally by temperature changes,
rather than precipitation changes, on the global average. 

The Antarctic ice sheet is likely to gain mass because of
greater precipitation, while the Greenland ice sheet is likely to
lose mass because the increase in runoff will exceed the
precipitation increase. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)

has attracted special attention because it contains enough ice
to raise sea level by 6 m and because of suggestions that
instabilities associated with its being grounded below sea level
may result in rapid ice discharge when the surrounding ice
shelves are weakened. However, loss of grounded ice leading
to substantial sea level rise from this source is now widely
agreed to be very unlikely during the 21st century, although its
dynamics are still inadequately understood, especially for
projections on longer time-scales.

Figure 24: Global average sea level rise 1990 to 2100 for the SRES scenarios. Thermal expansion and land ice changes were calculated using a
simple climate model calibrated separately for each of seven AOGCMs, and contributions from changes in permafrost, the effect of sediment
deposition and the long-term adjustment of the ice sheets to past climate change were added. Each of the six lines appearing in the key is the
average of AOGCMs for one of the six illustrative scenarios. The region in dark shading shows the range of the average of AOGCMs for all thirty
five SRES scenarios. The region in light shading shows the range of all AOGCMs for all thirty five scenarios. The region delimited by the outermost
lines shows the range of all AOGCMs and scenarios including uncertainty in land-ice changes, permafrost changes and sediment deposition. Note
that this range does not allow for uncertainty relating to ice-dynamic changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet. [Based on Figure 11.12]

F.9    Projections  of  Future  Chang es  in  Sea
Level

Projections of global average sea level rise from 1990 to
2100, using a range of AOGCMs following the IS92a
scenario (including the direct effect of sulphate aerosol
emissions), lie in the range 0.11 to 0.77 m. This range
reflects the systematic uncertainty of modelling. The main
contributions to this sea level rise are:

G a thermal expansion of 0.11 to 0.43 m, accelerating

through the 21st century; 

G a glacier contribution of 0.01 to 0.23 m; 
G a Greenland contribution of −0.02 to 0.09 m; and
G an Antarctic contribution of −0.17 to +0.02 m.
Also included in the computation of the total change are
smaller contributions from thawing of permafrost,
deposition of sediment, and the ongoing contributions from
ice sheets as a result of climate change since the Last
Glacial Maximum. To establish the range of sea level rise
resulting from the choice of different SRES scenarios,
results for thermal expansion and land-ice change from
simple models tuned to several AOGCMs are used (as in
Section F.3 for temperature). 

For the full set of SRES scenarios, a sea level rise of 0.09 to
0.88 m is projected for 1990 to 2100 (see Figure 24),
primarily from thermal expansion and loss of mass from
glaciers and ice caps. The central value is 0.48 m, which
corresponds to an average rate of about two to four times the
rate over the 20th century. The range of sea level rise
presented in the SAR was 0.13 to 0.94 m based on the IS92
scenarios. Despite higher temperature change projections in
this assessment, the sea level projections are slightly lower,
primarily due to the use of improved models which give a
smaller contribution from glaciers and ice sheets. If
terrestrial storage continues at its current rates, the
projections could be changed by –0.21 to 0.11 m. For an
average of the AOGCMs, the SRES scenarios give results
that differ by 0.02 m or less for the first half of the 21st
century. By 2100, they vary over a range amounting to about
50% of the central value. Beyond the 21st century, sea level
rise depends strongly on the emissions scenario. 

Models agree on the qualitative conclusion that the range of
regional variation in sea level change is substantial

compared to global average sea level rise. However,
confidence in the regional distribution of sea level change
from AOGCMs is low because there is little similarity
between models, although nearly all models project greater
than average rise in the Arctic Ocean and less than average
rise in the Southern Ocean. Further, land movements, both
isostatic and tectonic, will continue through the 21st century
at rates that are unaffected by climate change. It can be
expected that by 2100, many regions currently experiencing
relative sea level fall will instead have a rising relative sea
level. Lastly, extreme high water levels will occur with
increasing frequency as a result of mean sea level rise. Their
frequency may be further increased if storms become more
frequent or severe as a result of climate change. 

F.10  Projections  of  Future  Chang es  in
Response  to  CO 2 Concentration
Stabilisation  Profiles

Greenhouse  gases  and  aerosols 
All of the stabilisation profiles studied require CO2
emissions to eventually drop well below current levels.
Anthropogenic CO2 emission rates that arrive at stable CO2
concentration levels from 450 to 1,000 ppm were deduced
from the prescribed CO2 profiles (Figure 25a). The results
(Figure 25b) are not substantially different from those
presented in the SAR; however, the range is larger, mainly
due to the range of future terrestrial carbon uptake caused
by different assumptions in the models. Stabilisation at 450,
650 or 1,000 ppm would require global anthropogenic
emissions to drop below 1990 levels within a few decades,
about a century, or about two centuries, respectively, and
continue to steadily decrease thereafter. Although there is
sufficient uptake capacity in the ocean to incorporate 70 to
80% of foreseeable anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the
atmosphere, this process takes centuries due to the rate of
ocean mixing. As a result, even several centuries after
emissions occurred, about a quarter of the increase in
concentration caused by these emissions is still present in
the atmosphere. To maintain constant CO2 concentration
beyond 2300 requires emissions to drop to match the rate of
carbon sinks at that time. Natural land and ocean sinks with
the capacity to persist for hundreds or thousands of years are
small (<0.2 PgC/yr).

Figure 25: Projcted CO2 emissions permitting stabilisation of atmospheric
CO2 concentrations at different final values. Panel (a) shows the assumed
trajectories of CO2 concentration (WRE scenarios) and panels (b) and (c)
show the implied CO2 emissions, as projected with two fast carbon cycle
models, Bern-CC and ISAM. The model ranges for ISAM were obtained
by tuning the model to approximate the range of responses to CO2 and
climate from model intercomparisons. This approach yields a lower bound
on uncertainties in the carbon cycle response. The model ranges for Bern-
CC were obtained by combining different bounding assumptions about the
behaviour of the CO2 fertilization effect, the response of heterotrophic
respiration to temperature and the turnover time of the ocean, thus
approaching an upper bound on uncertainties in the carbon cycle
response. For each model, the upper and lower bounds are indicated by
the top and bottom of the shaded area. Alternatively, the lower bound
(where hidden) is indicated by a hatched line. [Based on Figure 3.13]

Temperature 
Global mean temperature continues to increase for hundreds
of years at a rate of a few tenths of a degree per century after
concentrations of CO2 have been stabilised, due to long 
time-scales in the ocean. The temperature implications of CO2
concentration profiles leading to stabilisation from 450 ppm to
1,000 ppm were studied using a simple climate model tuned to
seven AOGCMs with a mean climate sensitivity of 2.8°C. For
all the pathways leading to stabilisation, the climate system
shows considerable warming during the 21st century and
beyond (see Figure 26). The lower the level at which 
concentrations stabilise, the smaller the total temperature change.

Figure 26: Simple model results: Projected global mean temperature
changes when the concentration of CO2 is stabilised following the WRE
profiles (see Chapter 9 Section 9.3.3). For comparison, results based on
the S profiles in the SAR are also shown in green (S1000 not available).
The results are the average produced by a simple climate model tuned
to seven AOGCMs. The baseline scenario is scenario A1B, this is
specified only to 2100. After 2100, the emissions of gases other than
CO2 are assumed to remain constant at their A1B 2100 values. The
projections are labelled according to the level of CO2 stabilisation. The
broken lines after 2100 indicate increased uncertainty in the simple
climate model results beyond 2100. The black dots indicate the time of
CO2 stabilisation. The stabilisation year for the WRE1000 profile is 2375.
[Based on Figure 9.16]

Sea  level
If greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised (even at
present levels), sea level would nonetheless continue to rise for
hundreds of years. After 500 years, sea level rise from thermal
expansion may have reached only half of its eventual level,
which models suggest may lie within a range of 0.5 to 2.0 m
and 1 to 4 m for CO2 levels of twice and four times pre-
industrial, respectively. The long time-scale is characteristic of
the weak diffusion and slow circulation processes that
transport heat into the deep ocean.

The loss of a substantial fraction of the total glacier mass is
likely. Areas that are currently marginally glaciated are most
likely to become ice-free.

Ice sheets will continue to react to climatic change during the
next several thousand years, even if the climate is stabilised.
Together, the present Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets
contain enough water to raise sea level by almost 70 m if they
were to melt, so that only a small fractional change in their
volume would have a significant effect.

Models project that a local annual average warming of larger
than 3°C, sustained for millennia, would lead to virtually a
complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a reulting
sea level rise of about 7 m. Projected temperatures over
Greenland are generally greater than globally averaged
temperatures by a factor of 1.2 to 3.1 for the range of models

used in Chapter 11. For a warming over Greenland of 5.5°C,
consistent with mid-range stabilisation scenarios (see Figure
26), the Greenland ice sheet is likely to contribute about 3 m
in 1,000 years. For a warming of 8°C, the contribution is about
6 m, the ice sheet being largely eliminated. For smaller
warmings, the decay of the ice sheet would be substantially
slower (see Figure 27).

Current ice dynamic models project that the West Antarctic ice
sheet (WAIS) will contribute no more than 3 mm/yr to sea level
rise over the next thousand years, even if significant changes
were to occur in the ice shelves. Such results are strongly
dependent on model assumptions regarding climate change
scenarios, ice dynamics and other factors. Apart from the
possibility of an internal ice dynamic instability, surface
melting will affect the long-term viability of the Antarctic ice
sheet. For warmings of more than 10ºC, simple runoff models
predict that a zone of net mass loss would develop on the ice
sheet surface. Irreversible disintegration of the WAIS would
result because the WAIS cannot retreat to higher ground once
its margins are subjected to surface melting and begin to
recede. Such a disintegration would take at least a few
millennia. Thresholds for total disintegration of the East
Antarctic ice sheet by surface melting involve warmings above
20ºC, a situation that has not occurred for at least 15 million
years and which is far more than predicted by any scenario of
climate change currently under consideration.

G. Advancing  Understanding 

G.2  Climate  Processes  and  Modelling

The previous sections have contained descriptions of the
current state of knowledge of the climate of the past and
present, the current understanding of the forcing agents and
processes in the climate system and how well they can be
represented in climate models. Given the knowledge possessed
today, the best assessment was given whether climate change
can be detected and whether that change can be attributed to
human influence. With the best tools available today,
projections were made of how the climate could change in the
future for different scenarios of emissions of greenhouse gases.

This Section looks into the future in a different way.
Uncertainties are present in each step of the chain from
emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, through to the
impacts that they have on the climate system and society (see
Figure 28). Many factors continue to limit the ability to detect,
attribute, and understand current climate change and to project
what future climate changes may be. Further work is needed in
nine broad areas.

G.1  Data

Arrest the decline of observational networks in many parts of
the world. Unless networks are significantly improved, it may
be difficult or impossible to detect climate change in many
areas of the globe.

Expand the observational foundation for climate studies to
provide accurate, long-term data with expanded temporal and
spatial coverage. Given the complexity of the climate system
and the inherent multi-decadal time-scale, there is a need for
long-term consistent data to support climate and environmental
change investigations and projections. Data from the present
and recent past, climate-relevant data for the last few centuries,
and for the last several millennia are all needed. There is a
particular shortage of data in polar regions and data for the
quantitative assessment of extremes on the global scale.

Estimate better future emissions and concentrations of
greenhouse gases and aerosols. It is particularly important that
improvements are realised in deriving concentrations from
emissions of gases and particularly aerosols, in addressing
biogeochemical sequestration and cycling, and specifically,
and in determining the spatial-temporal distribution of CO2
sources and sinks, currently and in the future. 

Understand and characterise more completely dominant
processes (e.g., ocean mixing) and feedbacks (e.g., from
clouds and sea ice) in the atmosphere, biota, land and ocean
surfaces, and deep oceans. These sub-systems, phenomena,
and processes are important and merit increased attention to
improve prognostic capabilities generally. The interplay of
observation and models will be the key for progress. The
rapid forcing of a non-linear system has a high prospect of
producing surprises.

Address more completely patterns of long-term climate
variability. This topic arises both in model calculations and in
the climate system. In simulations, the issue of climate drift
within model calculations needs to be clarified better in part
because it compounds the difficulty of distinguishing signal
and noise. With respect to the long-term natural variability in
the climate system per se, it is important to understand this
variability and to expand the emerging capability of
predicting patterns of organised variability such as ENSO. 

Explore more fully the probabilistic character of future
climate states by developing multiple ensembles of model
calculations. The climate system is a coupled non-linear
chaotic system, and therefore the long-term prediction of
future exact climate states is not possible. Rather the focus
must be upon the prediction of the probability distribution of
the system’s future possible states by the generation of
ensembles of model solutions. 

Improve the integrated hierarchy of global and regional
climate models with emphasis on improving the simulation of
regional impacts and extreme weather events. This will require
improvements in the understanding of the coupling between
the major atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial systems, and
extensive diagnostic modelling and observational studies that
evaluate and improve simulative performance. A particularly
important issue is the adequacy of data needed to attack the
question of changes in extreme events.

78

G.3  Human  Aspects

Link more formally physical climate-biogeochemical models
with models of the human system and thereby provide the basis
for expanded exploration of possible cause-effect-cause
patterns linking human and non-human components of the
Earth system. At present, human influences generally are
treated only through emission scenarios that provide external
forcings to the climate system. In future more comprehensive
models are required in which human activities need to begin to
interact with the dynamics of physical, chemical, and
biological sub-systems through a diverse set of contributing
activities, feedbacks and responses.

G.4  International  Framework

Accelerate internationally progress in understanding climate
change by strengthening the international framework that is
needed to co-ordinate national and institutional efforts so that
research, computational, and observational resources may be
used to the greatest overall advantage. Elements of this
framework exist in the international programmes supported by
the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the United
Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation
(UNESCO). There is a corresponding need for strengthening
the co-operation within the international research community,
building research capacity in many regions and, as is the goal
of this assessment, effectively describing research advances in
terms that are relevant to decision making.

1.1 Introduction to the Climate System

1.1.1 Climate

Weather and climate
Weather and climate have a profound influence on life on Earth.
They are part of the daily experience of human beings and are
essential  for  health, food  production  and  well-being.  Many
consider  the  prospect  of  human-induced  climate  change  as  a
matter  of  concern.  The  IPCC  Second  Assessment  Report
(IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) presented scientific evidence that
human activities may already be influencing the climate. If one
wishes to understand, detect and eventually predict the human
influence on climate, one needs to understand the system that
determines  the  climate  of  the  Earth  and  of  the  processes  that
lead to climate change.

In common parlance the notions “weather” and “climate”
are loosely defined1. The “weather”, as we experience it, is the
fluctuating state of the atmosphere around us, characterised by
the temperature, wind, precipitation, clouds and other weather
elements. This weather is the result of rapidly developing and
decaying  weather  systems  such  as  mid-latitude  low  and  high
pressure  systems  with  their  associated  frontal  zones, showers
and tropical cyclones. Weather has only limited predictability.
Mesoscale convective systems are predictable over a period of
hours only; synoptic scale cyclones may be predictable over a
period  of  several  days  to  a  week.  Beyond  a  week  or  two
individual weather systems are unpredictable. “Climate” refers
to the average weather in terms of the mean and its variability
over  a  certain  time-span  and  a  certain  area.  Classical
climatology  provides  a  classification  and  description  of  the
various  climate  regimes  found  on  Earth.  Climate  varies  from
place  to  place, depending  on  latitude, distance  to  the  sea,
vegetation, presence  or  absence  of  mountains  or  other
geographical factors. Climate varies also in time; from season
to  season, year  to  year, decade  to  decade  or  on  much  longer
time-scales, such  as  the  Ice  Ages.  Statistically  significant
variations of the mean state of the climate or of its variability,
typically  persisting  for  decades  or  longer, are  referred  to  as
“climate  change”.  The  Glossary  gives  definitions  of  these
important  and  central  notions  of  “climate  variability” and
“climate change”.

Climate variations and change, caused by external forcings,
may be partly predictable, particularly on the larger, continental
and global, spatial scales. Because human activities, such as the
emission of greenhouse gases or land-use change, do result in
external  forcing, it  is  believed  that  the  large-scale  aspects  of
human-induced  climate  change  are  also  partly  predictable.
However  the  ability  to  actually  do  so  is  limited  because  we
cannot accurately predict population change, economic change,
technological development, and other relevant characteristics of
future human activity. In practice, therefore, one has to rely on
carefully  constructed  scenarios  of  human  behaviour  and
determine climate projections on the basis of such scenarios.

1 For a definition of scientific and technical terms used in this
Report: see Appendix I: Glossary.

Climate variables
The  traditional  knowledge  of  weather  and  climate  focuses  on
those  variables  that  affect  daily  life  most  directly: average,
maximum and minimum temperature, wind near the surface of the
Earth, precipitation in its various forms, humidity, cloud type and
amount, and  solar  radiation.  These  are  the  variables  observed
hourly by a large number of weather stations around the globe.

However  this  is  only  part  of  the  reality  that  determines
weather and climate. The growth, movement and decay of weather
systems depend also on the vertical structure of the atmosphere, the
influence of the underlying land and sea and many other factors not
directly experienced by human beings. Climate is determined by
the atmospheric circulation and by its interactions with the large-
scale ocean currents and the land with its features such as albedo,
vegetation and soil moisture. The climate of the Earth as a whole
depends on factors that influence the radiative balance, such as for
example, the atmospheric composition, solar radiation or volcanic
eruptions. To  understand  the  climate  of  our  planet  Earth  and  its
variations and to understand and possibly predict the changes of
the climate brought about by human activities, one cannot ignore
any  of  these  many  factors  and  components  that  determine  the
climate. We must understand the climate system, the complicated
system consisting of various components, including the dynamics
and composition of the atmosphere, the ocean, the ice and snow
cover, the  land  surface  and  its  features, the  many  mutual
interactions  between  them, and  the  large  variety  of  physical,
chemical  and  biological  processes  taking  place  in  and  among
these components. “Climate” in a wider sense refers to the state of
the climate system as a whole, including a statistical description of
its variations. This chapter provides the reader with an overview of
the climate system and the climate in this wider sense, and acts as
an introduction to the Report.

1.1.2 The Climate System

Its components
The  climate  system, as  defined  in  this  Report, is  an  interactive
system consisting of five major components: the atmosphere, the
hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the land surface and the biosphere,
forced or influenced by various external forcing mechanisms, the
most  important  of  which  is  the  Sun  (see  Figure  1.1). Also  the
direct effect of human activities on the climate system is consid-
ered an external forcing.

The  atmosphere is  the  most  unstable  and  rapidly  changing
part of the system. Its composition, which has changed with the
evolution  of  the  Earth, is  of  central  importance  to  the  problem
assessed in this Report. The Earth’s dry atmosphere is composed
mainly of nitrogen (N2, 78.1% volume mixing ratio), oxygen (O2,
20.9% volume mixing ratio, and argon (Ar, 0.93% volume mixing
ratio).  These  gases  have  only  limited  interaction  with  the
incoming solar radiation and they do not interact with the infrared
radiation  emitted  by  the  Earth.  However  there  are  a  number  of
trace gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3), which do absorb and emit infrared
radiation. These so called greenhouse gases, with a total volume
mixing  ratio  in  dry  air  of  less  than  0.1%  by  volume, play  an
essential  role  in  the  Earth’s  energy  budget.  Moreover  the

atmosphere contains water vapour (H2O), which is also a natural
greenhouse gas. Its volume mixing ratio is highly variable, but it
is typically in the order of 1%. Because these greenhouse gases
absorb  the  infrared  radiation  emitted  by  the  Earth  and  emit
infrared  radiation  up-  and  downward, they  tend  to  raise  the
temperature near the Earth’s surface. Water vapour, CO2 and O3
also absorb solar short-wave radiation.

The  atmospheric  distribution  of  ozone  and  its  role  in  the
Earth’s energy budget is unique. Ozone in the lower part of the
atmosphere, the  troposphere  and  lower  stratosphere, acts  as  a
greenhouse gas. Higher up in the stratosphere there is a natural
layer of high ozone concentration, which absorbs solar ultra-violet
radiation. In this way this so-called ozone layer plays an essential
role  in  the  stratosphere’s  radiative  balance, at  the  same  time
filtering out this potentially damaging form of radiation.

Beside  these  gases, the  atmosphere  also  contains  solid  and
liquid  particles  (aerosols)  and  clouds, which  interact  with  the
incoming and outgoing radiation in a complex and spatially very
variable manner. The most variable component of the atmosphere
is water in its various phases such as vapour, cloud droplets, and
ice  crystals.  Water  vapour  is  the  strongest  greenhouse  gas.  For
these  reasons  and  because  the  transition  between  the  various
phases absorb and release much energy, water vapour is central to
the climate and its variability and change.

The  hydrosphere is  the  component  comprising  all  liquid
surface  and  subterranean  water, both  fresh  water, including
rivers, lakes and aquifers, and saline water of the oceans and
seas. Fresh water runoff from the land returning to the oceans
in  rivers  influences  the  ocean’s  composition  and  circulation.
The  oceans  cover  approximately  70%  of  the  Earth’s  surface.
They store and transport a large amount of energy and dissolve
and store great quantities of carbon dioxide. Their circulation,
driven by the wind and by density contrasts caused by salinity
and thermal gradients (the so-called thermohaline circulation),
is much slower than the atmospheric circulation. Mainly due to
the  large  thermal  inertia  of  the  oceans, they  damp  vast  and
strong temperature changes and function as a regulator of the
Earth’s climate and as a source of natural climate variability, in
particular on the longer time-scales.

The cryosphere, including the ice sheets of Greenland and
Antarctica, continental  glaciers  and  snow  fields, sea  ice  and
permafrost, derives its importance to the climate system from
its  high  reflectivity  (albedo)  for  solar  radiation, its  low
thermal conductivity, its large thermal inertia and, especially,
its  critical  role  in  driving  deep  ocean  water  circulation.
Because  the  ice  sheets  store  a  large  amount  of  water,
variations in their volume are a potential source of sea level
variations (Chapter 11).

Vegetation and soils at the land surface control how energy
received  from  the  Sun  is  returned  to  the  atmosphere.  Some  is
returned  as  long-wave  (infrared)  radiation, heating  the
atmosphere as the land surface warms. Some serves to evaporate
water, either in the soil or in the leaves of plants, bringing water
back  into  the  atmosphere.  Because  the  evaporation  of  soil
moisture requires energy, soil moisture has a strong influence on
the  surface  temperature.  The  texture  of  the  land  surface  (its
roughness) influences the atmosphere dynamically as winds blow
over  the  land’s  surface.  Roughness  is  determined  by  both
topography  and  vegetation.  Wind  also  blows  dust  from  the
surface into the atmosphere, which interacts with the atmospheric
radiation.

The marine and terrestrial biospheres have a major impact
on the atmosphere’s composition. The biota influence the uptake
and  release  of  greenhouse  gases.  Through  the  photosynthetic
process, both  marine  and  terrestrial  plants  (especially  forests)
store significant amounts of carbon from carbon dioxide. Thus,
the biosphere plays a central role in the carbon cycle, as well as
in the budgets of many other gases, such as methane and nitrous
oxide.  Other  biospheric  emissions  are  the  so-called  volatile
organic compounds (VOC) which may have important effects on
atmospheric  chemistry, on  aerosol  formation  and  therefore  on
climate. Because the storage of carbon and the exchange of trace
gases  are  influenced  by  climate, feedbacks  between  climate
change and atmospheric concentrations of trace gases can occur.
The influence of climate on the biosphere is preserved as fossils,
tree  rings, pollen  and  other  records, so  that  much  of  what  is
known of past climates comes from such biotic indicators.

Interactions among the components
Many  physical, chemical  and  biological  interaction  processes
occur among the various components of the climate system on a
wide  range  of  space  and  time  scales, making  the  system
extremely  complex.  Although  the  components  of  the  climate
system  are  very  different  in  their  composition, physical  and
chemical properties, structure and behaviour, they are all linked
by fluxes of mass, heat and momentum: all subsystems are open
and interrelated.

As an example, the atmosphere and the oceans are strongly
coupled  and  exchange, among  others, water  vapour  and  heat
through evaporation. This is part of the hydrological cycle and
leads to condensation, cloud formation, precipitation and runoff,
and  supplies  energy  to  weather  systems.  On  the  other  hand,
precipitation has an influence on salinity, its distribution and the
thermohaline  circulation.  Atmosphere  and  oceans  also
exchange, among  other  gases, carbon  dioxide, maintaining  a
balance by dissolving it in cold polar water which sinks  into the
deep  ocean  and  by  outgassing  in  relatively  warm  upwelling
water near the equator.

Some  other  examples: sea  ice  hinders  the  exchanges
between  atmosphere  and  oceans;  the  biosphere  influences  the
carbon dioxide concentration by photosynthesis and respiration,
which in turn is influenced by climate change. The biosphere also
affects the input of water in the atmosphere through evapotran-
spiration, and  the  atmosphere’s  radiative  balance  through  the
amount of sunlight reflected back to the sky (albedo).

These are just a few examples from a virtually inexhaustible
list of complex interactions some of which are poorly known or
perhaps even unknown. Chapter 7 provides an assessment of the
present knowledge of physical climate processes and feedbacks,
whilst Chapter 3 deals with biological feedbacks.

Any  change, whether  natural  or  anthropogenic, in  the
components of the climate system and their interactions, or in the
external forcing, may result in climate variations. The following
sections introduce various aspects of natural climate variations,
followed  by  an  introduction  to  the  human  influence  on  the
climate system.

1.2 Natural Climate Variations

1.2.1 Natural Forcing of the Climate System

The Sun and the global energy balance
The ultimate source of energy that drives the climate system is
radiation from the Sun. About half of the radiation is in the visible
short-wave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The other half
is mostly in the near-infrared part, with some in the ultraviolet
part of the spectrum. Each square metre of the Earth’s spherical
surface  outside  the  atmosphere  receives  an  average  throughout
the  year  of  342  Watts  of  solar  radiation, 31%  of  which  is
immediately  reflected  back  into  space  by  clouds, by  the
atmosphere, and by the Earth’s surface. The remaining 235 Wm−2
is partly absorbed by the atmosphere but most (168 Wm−2) warms
the Earth’s surface: the land and the ocean. The Earth’s surface
returns that heat to the atmosphere, partly as infrared radiation,
partly as sensible heat and as water vapour which releases its heat
when it condenses higher up in the atmosphere. This exchange of
energy between surface and atmosphere maintains under present
conditions a global mean temperature near the surface of 14°C,
decreasing rapidly with height and reaching a mean temperature
of –58°C at the top of the troposphere.

For  a  stable  climate, a  balance  is  required  between
incoming solar radiation and the outgoing radiation emitted by
the  climate  system.  Therefore  the  climate  system  itself  must
radiate  on  average  235 Wm−2 back  into  space.  Details  of  this
energy balance can be seen in Figure 1.2, which shows on the
left hand side what happens with the incoming solar radiation,
and  on  the  right  hand  side    how  the  atmosphere  emits  the
outgoing infrared radiation. Any physical object radiates energy
of an amount and at wavelengths typical for the temperature of
the  object: at  higher  temperatures  more  energy  is  radiated  at
shorter  wavelengths.  For  the  Earth  to  radiate  235  Wm–2, it
should  radiate  at  an  effective  emission  temperature  of  −19°C
with  typical  wavelengths  in  the  infrared  part  of  the  spectrum.
This is 33°C lower than the average temperature of 14°C at the
Earth’s surface. To understand why this is so, one must take into
account the radiative properties of the atmosphere in the infrared
part of the spectrum.

The natural greenhouse effect
The  atmosphere  contains  several  trace  gases  which  absorb  and
emit infrared radiation. These so-called greenhouse gases absorb
infrared radiation, emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere

Figure 1.2: The Earth’s annual and global mean energy balance. Of the incoming solar radiation, 49% (168 Wm−2) is absorbed by the surface. That heat is
returned to the atmosphere as sensible heat, as evapotranspiration (latent heat) and as thermal infrared radiation. Most of this radiation is absorbed by the
atmosphere, which in turn emits radiation both up and down. The radiation lost to space comes from cloud tops and atmospheric regions much colder than the
surface. This causes a greenhouse effect. Source: Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997: Earth’s Annual Global Mean Energy Budget, Bull. Am. Met. Soc. 78, 197-208.

and clouds, except in a transparent part of the spectrum called the
“atmospheric window”, as shown in Figure 1.2. They emit in turn
infrared  radiation  in  all  directions  including  downward  to  the
Earth’s  surface.  Thus  greenhouse  gases  trap  heat  within  the
atmosphere.  This  mechanism  is  called  the  natural  greenhouse
effect. The net result is an upward transfer of infrared radiation
from warmer levels near the Earth’s surface to colder levels at
higher  altitudes.  The  infrared  radiation  is  effectively  radiated
back  into  space  from  an  altitude  with  a  temperature  of, on
average, −19°C, in balance with the incoming radiation, whereas
the Earth’s surface is kept at a much higher temperature of on
average  14°C.  This  effective  emission  temperature  of  −19°C
corresponds  in  mid-latitudes  with  a  height  of  approximately  5
km.  Note  that  it  is  essential  for  the  greenhouse  effect  that  the
temperature of the lower atmosphere is not constant (isothermal)
but decreases with height. The natural greenhouse effect is part
of the energy balance of the Earth, as can be seen schematically
in Figure 1.2.

Clouds  also  play  an  important    role  in  the  Earth’s  energy
balance and in particular in the natural greenhouse effect. Clouds
absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus contribute to warming
the Earth’s surface, just like the greenhouse gases. On the other
hand, most clouds are bright reflectors of solar radiation and
tend to cool the climate system. The net average effect of the
Earth’s cloud cover in the present climate is a slight cooling: the

reflection of radiation more than compensates for the greenhouse
effect of clouds. However this effect is highly variable, depending
on height, type and optical properties of clouds.

This  introduction  to  the  global  energy  balance  and  the
natural greenhouse effect is entirely in terms of the global mean
and in radiative terms. However, for a full understanding of the
greenhouse  effect  and  of  its  impact  on  the  climate  system,
dynamical feedbacks and energy transfer processes should also
be taken into account. Chapter 7 presents a more detailed analysis
and assessment.

Radiative forcing and forcing variability
In an equilibrium climate state the average net radiation at the top
of the atmosphere is zero. A change in either the solar radiation
or the infrared radiation changes the net radiation. The correspon-
ding imbalance is called “radiative forcing”. In practice, for this
purpose, the top of the troposphere (the tropopause) is taken as
the top of the atmosphere, because the stratosphere adjusts in a
matter of months to changes in the radiative balance, whereas the
surface-troposphere  system  adjusts  much  more  slowly, owing
principally  to  the  large  thermal  inertia  of  the  oceans.  The
radiative  forcing  of  the  surface  troposphere  system  is  then  the
change  in  net  irradiance  at  the  tropopause  after  allowing  for
stratospheric  temperatures  to  re-adjust  to  radiative  equilibrium,
but  with  surface  and  tropospheric  temperatures  and  state  held

fixed  at  the  unperturbed  values.  A  detailed  explanation  and
discussion  of  the  radiative  forcing  concept  may  be  found  in
Appendix 6.1 to Chapter 6.

External  forcings, such  as  the  solar  radiation  or  the  large
amounts  of  aerosols  ejected  by  volcanic  eruption  into  the
atmosphere, may  vary  on  widely  different  time-scales, causing
natural variations in the radiative forcing. These variations may
be  negative  or  positive.  In  either  case  the  climate  system  must
react to restore the balance. A positive radiative forcing tends to
warm  the  surface  on  average, whereas  a  negative  radiative
forcing tends to cool it. Internal climate processes and feedbacks
may also cause variations in the radiative balance by their impact
on the reflected solar radiation or emitted infrared radiation, but
such  variations  are  not  considered  part  of  radiative  forcing.
Chapter 6 assesses the present knowledge of radiative forcing and
its  variations, including  the  anthropogenic  change  of  the
atmospheric composition.

1.2.2 Natural Variability of Climate

Internally and externally induced climate variability
Climate variations, both in the mean state and in other statistics
such as, for example, the occurrence of extreme events, may result
from radiative forcing, but also from internal interactions between
components of the climate system. A distinction can therefore be
made between externally and internally induced natural climate
variability and change.

When variations in the external forcing occur, the response
time  of  the  various  components  of  the  climate  system  is  very
different. With regard to the atmosphere, the response time of the
troposphere is relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the
stratosphere comes into equilibrium on a time-scale of typically a
few months. Due to their large heat capacity, the oceans have a
much longer response time, typically decades but up to centuries
or millennia. The response time of the strongly coupled surface-
troposphere system is therefore slow compared with that of the
stratosphere, and  is  mainly  determined  by  the  oceans.  The
biosphere may respond fast, e.g. to droughts, but also very slowly
to  imposed  changes.  Therefore  the  system  may  respond  to
variations in external forcing on a wide range of space- and time-
scales. The impact of solar variations on the climate provides an
example of such externally induced climate variations.

But  even  without  changes  in  external  forcing, the  climate
may vary naturally, because, in a system of components with very
different  response  times  and  non-linear  interactions, the
components are never in equilibrium and are constantly varying.
An  example  of  such  internal  climate  variation  is  the  El  Niño-
Southern  Oscillation  (ENSO), resulting  from  the  interaction
between atmosphere and ocean in the tropical Pacific.

Feedbacks and non-linearities
The  response  of  the  climate  to  the  internal  variability  of  the
climate system  and to external forcings is further complicated by
feedbacks and non-linear responses of the components. A process
is called a feedback when the result of the process affects its origin
thereby  intensifying  (positive  feedback)  or  reducing  (negative
feedback) the original effect. An important example of a positive

feedback  is  the  water  vapour  feedback  in  which  the  amount  of
water vapour in the atmosphere increases as the Earth warms. This
increase in turn may amplify the warming because water vapour
is  a  strong  greenhouse  gas.  A  strong  and  very  basic  negative
feedback is radiative damping: an increase in temperature strongly
increases the amount of emitted infrared radiation. This limits and
controls the original temperature increase.

A distinction is made between physical feedbacks involving
physical  climate  processes, and  biogeochemical  feedbacks  often
involving coupled biological, geological and chemical processes.
An example of a physical feedback is the complicated interaction
between clouds and the radiative balance. Chapter 7 provides an
overview  and  assessment  of  the  present  knowledge  of  such
feedbacks. An important example of a biogeochemical feedback is
the interaction between the atmospheric CO2 concentration and the
carbon uptake by the land surface and the oceans. Understanding
this feedback is essential for an understanding of the carbon cycle.
This is discussed and assessed in detail in Chapter 3.

Many  processes  and  interactions  in  the  climate  system  are
non-linear. That means that there is no simple proportional relation
between  cause  and  effect.  A  complex, non-linear  system  may
display what is technically called chaotic behaviour. This means
that  the  behaviour  of  the  system  is  critically  dependent  on  very
small  changes  of  the  initial  conditions.  This  does  not  imply,
however, that  the  behaviour  of  non-linear  chaotic  systems  is
entirely unpredictable, contrary to what is meant by “chaotic” in
colloquial language. It has, however, consequences for the nature
of its variability and the predictability of its variations. The daily
weather  is  a  good  example.  The  evolution  of  weather  systems
responsible for the daily weather is governed by such non-linear
chaotic  dynamics.  This  does  not  preclude  successful  weather
prediction, but its predictability is limited to a period of at most
two weeks. Similarly, although the climate system is highly non-
linear, the  quasi-linear  response  of  many  models  to  present  and
predicted  levels  of  external  radiative  forcing  suggests  that  the
large-scale  aspects  of  human-induced  climate  change  may  be
predictable, although  as  discussed  in  Section  1.3.2  below,
unpredictable behaviour of non-linear systems can never be ruled
out.  The  predictability  of  the  climate  system  is  discussed  in
Chapter 7.

Global and hemispheric variability
Climate varies naturally on all time-scales. During the last million
years or so, glacial periods and interglacials have alternated as a
result  of  variations  in  the  Earth’s  orbital  parameters. Based  on
Antarctic ice cores, more detailed information is available now
about the four full glacial cycles during the last 500,000 years. In
recent years it was discovered that during the last glacial period
large and very rapid temperature variations took place over large
parts  of  the  globe, in  particular  in  the  higher  latitudes  of  the
Northern  Hemisphere.  These  abrupt  events  saw  temperature
changes of many degrees within a human lifetime. In contrast, the
last  10,000  years  appear  to  have  been  relatively  more  stable,
though locally quite large changes have occurred. 

Recent  analyses  suggest  that  the  Northern  Hemisphere
climate of the past 1,000 years was characterised by an irregular
but steady cooling, followed by a strong warming during the 20th

92

The Climate System: an Overview

century. Temperatures  were  relatively  warm  during  the  11th  to
13th  centuries  and  relatively  cool  during  the  16th  to  19th
centuries.  These  periods  coincide  with  what  are  traditionally
known as the medieval Climate Optimum and the Little Ice Age,
although these anomalies appear to have been most distinct only
in and around the North Atlantic region. Based on these analyses,
the warmth of the late 20th century appears to have been unprece-
dented  during  the  millennium.  A  comprehensive  review  and
assessment of observed global and hemispheric variability may
be found in Chapter 2.

The  scarce  data  from  the  Southern  Hemisphere  suggest
temperature  changes  in  past  centuries  markedly  different  from
those  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere, the  only  obvious  similarity
being the strong warming during the 20th century.

Regional patterns of climate variability
Regional or local climate is generally much more variable than
climate on a hemispheric or global scale because regional or local
variations  in  one  region  are  compensated  for  by  opposite
variations  elsewhere.  Indeed  a  closer  inspection  of  the  spatial
structure  of  climate  variability, in  particular  on  seasonal  and
longer  time-scales, shows  that  it  occurs  predominantly  in
preferred large-scale and geographically anchored spatial patterns.
Such  patterns  result  from  interactions  between  the  atmospheric
circulation and the land and ocean surfaces. Though geographi-
cally  anchored, their  amplitude  can  change  in  time  as, for
example, the heat exchange with the underlying ocean changes.

A  well-known  example  is  the  quasi-periodically  varying
ENSO phenomenon, caused by atmosphere-ocean interaction in
the tropical Pacific. The resulting El Niño and La Niña events have
a worldwide impact on weather and climate.

Another  example  is  the  North Atlantic  Oscillation  (NAO),
which has a strong influence on the climate of Europe and part of
Asia. This pattern consists of opposing variations of barometric
pressure near Iceland and near the Azores. On average, a westerly
current, between the Icelandic low pressure area and the Azores
high-pressure area, carries cyclones with their associated frontal
systems  towards  Europe.  However  the  pressure  difference
between Iceland and the Azores fluctuates on time-scales of days
to decades, and can be reversed at times. The variability of NAO
has considerable influence on the regional climate variability in
Europe, in  particular  in  wintertime.  Chapter  7  discusses  the
internal processes involved in NAO variability.

Similarly, although  data  are  scarcer, leading  modes  of
variability  have  been  identified  over  the  Southern  Hemisphere.
Examples  are  a  North-South  dipole  structure  over  the  Southern
Pacific, whose variability is strongly related to ENSO variability,
and the Antarctic Oscillation, a zonal pressure fluctuation between
middle and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. A detailed
account of regional climate variability may be found in Chapter 2. 

1.2.3 Extreme Events

Climate as defined is associated with a certain probability distri-
bution  of  weather  events. Weather  events  with  values  far  away
from the mean (such as heat waves, droughts and flooding) are by
definition less likely to occur. The least likely events in a statis-

tical sense are called “extreme events”. Extreme weather in one
region  (e.g.  a  heat  wave)  may  be  normal  in  another.  In  both
regions  nature  and  society  are  adapted  to  the  regional  weather
averaged  over  longer  periods, but  much  less  to  extremes.  For
example, tropical African  temperatures  could  severely  damage
vegetation or human health if they occurred in Northern Europe.
Impacts  of  extreme  events  are  felt  strongly  by  ecosystems  and
society and may be destructive.

Small changes in climate may, but will not necessarily, have
a large impact on the probability distribution of weather events in
space  and  time, and  on  the  intensity  of  extremes.  Nature  and
society are often particularly ill prepared and vulnerable for such
changes.  This  is  the  reason  why  since  the  SAR  much  more
attention has been paid to observed and projected variations of
extremes.  Chapter  2  gives  an  assessment  of  the  present
knowledge. 

1.3 Human-induced Climate Variations

1.3.1 Human Influence on the Climate System

Human  beings, like  other  living  organisms, have  always
influenced their environment. It is only since the beginning of the
Industrial  Revolution, mid-18th  century, that  the  impact  of
human  activities  has  begun  to  extend  to  a  much  larger  scale,
continental or even global. Human activities, in particular those
involving the combustion of fossil fuels for industrial or domestic
usage, and  biomass  burning, produce  greenhouse  gases  and
aerosols  which  affect  the  composition  of  the  atmosphere.  The
emission of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chlorine and
bromine  compounds  has  not  only  an  impact  on  the  radiative
forcing, but  has  also  led  to  the  depletion  of  the  stratospheric
ozone  layer.  Land-use  change, due  to  urbanisation  and  human
forestry and agricultural practices, affect the physical and biolog-
ical  properties  of  the  Earth’s  surface.  Such  effects  change  the
radiative  forcing  and  have  a  potential  impact  on  regional  and
global climate.

Anthropogenic perturbation of the atmospheric composition
For about a thousand years before the Industrial Revolution, the
amount  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere  remained
relatively  constant.  Since  then, the  concentration  of  various
greenhouse gases has increased. The amount of carbon dioxide,
for example, has increased by more than 30% since pre-industrial
times  and  is  still  increasing  at  an  unprecedented  rate  of  on
average  0.4%  per  year, mainly  due  to  the  combustion  of  fossil
fuels  and  deforestation.  We  know  that  this  increase  is  anthro-
pogenic  because  the  changing  isotopic  composition  of  the
atmospheric  CO2 betrays  the  fossil  origin  of  the  increase.  The
concentration  of  other  natural  radiatively  active  atmospheric
components, such as methane and nitrous oxide, is increasing as
well  due  to  agricultural, industrial  and  other  activities.  The
concentration of the nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and of carbon
monoxide (CO) are also increasing. Although these gases are not
greenhouse gases, they play a role in the atmospheric chemistry
and have led to an increase in tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse
gas, by  40%  since  pre-industrial  times  (Chapter  4).  Moreover,

The Climate System: an Overview

93

NO2 is  an  important  absorber  of  visible  solar  radiation.
Chlorofluorocarbons and some other halogen compounds do not
occur naturally in the atmosphere but have been introduced by
human  activities.  Beside  their  depleting  effect  on  the  stratos-
pheric  ozone  layer, they  are  strong  greenhouse  gases.  Their
greenhouse effect is only partly compensated for by the depletion
of the ozone layer which causes a negative forcing of the surface-
troposphere system. All these gases, except tropospheric ozone
and its precursors, have long to very long atmospheric lifetimes
and therefore become well-mixed throughout the atmosphere. 

Human industrial, energy related, and land-use activities also
increase the amount of aerosol in the atmosphere, in the form of
mineral dust, sulphates and nitrates and soot. Their atmospheric
lifetime  is  short  because  they  are  removed  by  rain. As  a  result
their  concentrations  are  highest  near  their  sources  and  vary
substantially regionally, with global consequences. The increases
in  greenhouse  gas  concentrations  and  aerosol  content  in  the
atmosphere result in a change in the radiative forcing to which the
climate system must act to restore the radiative balance.

The enhanced greenhouse effect
The  increased  concentration  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the
atmosphere  enhances  the  absorption  and  emission  of  infrared
radiation. The atmosphere’s opacity increases so that the altitude
from which the Earth’s radiation is effectively emitted into space
becomes  higher.  Because  the  temperature  is  lower  at  higher
altitudes, less  energy  is  emitted, causing  a  positive  radiative
forcing.  This  effect  is  called  the  enhanced  greenhouse  effect,
which is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.

If the amount of carbon dioxide were doubled instantaneously,
with  everything  else  remaining  the  same, the  outgoing  infrared
radiation would be reduced by about 4 Wm−2. In other words, the
radiative forcing corresponding to a doubling of the CO2 concen-
tration  would  be  4  Wm−2.  To  counteract  this  imbalance, the
temperature  of  the  surface-troposphere  system  would  have  to
increase by 1.2°C (with an accuracy of ±10%), in the absence of
other  changes.  In  reality, due  to  feedbacks, the  response  of  the
climate  system  is  much  more  complex.  It  is  believed  that  the
overall effect of the feedbacks amplifies the temperature increase
to 1.5 to 4.5°C. A significant part of this uncertainty range arises
from our limited knowledge of clouds and their interactions with
radiation.  To  appreciate  the  magnitude  of  this  temperature
increase, it should be compared with the global mean temperature
difference of perhaps 5 or 6°C from the middle of the last Ice Age
to the present interglacial. 

The so-called water vapour feedback, caused by an increase in
atmospheric water vapour due to a temperature increase, is  the most
important feedback responsible for the amplification of the temper-
ature increase. Concern has been expressed about the strength of
this feedback, in particular in relation to the role of upper tropos-
pheric humidity. Since the SAR, thinking about this feedback has
become increasingly sophisticated thanks both to modelling and to
observational  studies.  Feedbacks  are  discussed  and  assessed  in
Chapter 7. In particular, the present state of knowledge of the water
vapour feedback is examined in Section 7.2.1. 

It has been suggested that the absorption by CO2 is already
saturated so that an increase would have no effect. This, however,

is not the case. Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation in the
middle of its 15 µm band to the extent that radiation in the middle
of  this  band  cannot  escape  unimpeded: this  absorption  is
saturated. This, however, is not the case for the band’s wings. It
is because of these effects of partial saturation that the radiative
forcing is not proportional to the increase in the carbon dioxide
concentration but shows a logarithmic dependence. Every further
doubling adds an additional 4 Wm−2 to the radiative forcing.

The other human-made greenhouse gases add to the effect of
increased carbon dioxide. Their total effect at the surface is often
expressed  in  terms  of  the  effect  of  an  equivalent  increase  in
carbon dioxide.

The effect of aerosols
The effect of the increasing amount of aerosols on the radiative
forcing is complex and not yet well known. The direct effect is
the scattering of part of the incoming solar radiation back into
space. This causes a negative radiative forcing which may partly,
and  locally  even  completely, offset  the  enhanced  greenhouse
effect.  However, due  to  their  short  atmospheric  lifetime, the
radiative  forcing  is  very  inhomogeneous  in  space  and  in  time.
This  complicates  their  effect  on  the  highly  non-linear  climate
system.  Some  aerosols, such  as  soot, absorb  solar  radiation
directly, leading to local heating of the atmosphere, or absorb and
emit infrared radiation, adding to the enhanced greenhouse effect.
Aerosols  may  also  affect  the  number, density  and  size  of
cloud droplets. This may change the amount and optical proper-
ties of clouds, and hence their reflection and absorption. It may
also  have  an  impact  on  the  formation  of  precipitation.  As
discussed in Chapter 5, these are potentially important indirect
effects  of  aerosols, resulting  probably  in  a  negative  radiative
forcing of as yet very uncertain magnitude.

Land-use change
The  term  “land-use  change” refers  to  a  change  in  the  use  or
management  of  land.  Such  change  may  result  from  various
human  activities  such  as  changes  in  agriculture  and  irrigation,
deforestation, reforestation  and  afforestation, but  also  from
urbanisation or traffic. Land-use change results in changing the
physical and biological properties of the land surface and thus the
climate system.

It  is  now  recognized  that  land-use  change  on  the  present
scale may contribute significantly to changing the local, regional
or even global climate and moreover has an important impact on
the  carbon  cycle.  Physical  processes  and  feedbacks  caused  by
land-use change, that may have an impact on the climate, include
changes  in  albedo  and  surface  roughness, and  the  exchange
between  land  and  atmosphere  of  water  vapour  and  greenhouse
gases.  These  climatic  consequences  of  land-use  change  are
discussed  and  evaluated  in  Section  4  of  Chapter  7.  Land-use
change  may  also  affect  the  climate  system  through  biological
processes  and  feedbacks  involving  the  terrestrial  vegetation,
which may lead to changes in the sources and sinks of carbon in
its  various  forms.  Chapter  3  reviews  the  consequences  for  the
carbon  cycle.  Obviously  the  combined  effect  of  these  physical
and  biogeochemical  processes  and  feedbacks  is  complex, but
new data sets and models start to shed light on this.

94

The Climate System: an Overview

Urbanisation is another kind of land-use change. This may
affect the local wind climate through its influence on the surface
roughness. It may also create a local climate substantially warmer
than the surrounding countryside by the heat released by densely
populated human settlements, by changes in evaporation charac-
teristics  and  by  modifying  the  outgoing  long-wave  radiation
through  interception  by  tall  buildings  etc. This  is  known  as  an
“urban heat island”. The influence on the regional climate may be
noticeable but small. It may however have a significant influence
on long instrumental temperature records from stations affected
by expanding urbanisation. The consequences of this urbanisa-
tion effect for the global surface temperature record has been the
subject of debate. It is discussed in Section 2.2.2 of Chapter 2.

Climate response
The increase in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations in the
atmosphere and also land-use change produces a radiative forcing
or  affects  processes  and  feedbacks  in  the  climate  system.  As
discussed  in  Chapter  7, the  response  of  the  climate  to  these
human-induced  forcings  is  complicated  by  such  feedbacks, by
the strong non-linearity of many processes and by the fact that the
various  coupled  components  of  the  climate  system  have  very
different  response  times  to  perturbations.  Qualitatively, an
increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations leads to
an average increase of the temperature of the surface-troposphere
system. The response of the stratosphere is entirely different. The
stratosphere  is  characterised  by  a  radiative  balance  between
absorption of solar radiation, mainly by ozone, and emission of
infrared radiation mainly by carbon dioxide. An increase in the
carbon dioxide concentration therefore leads to an increase of the
emission and thus to a cooling of the stratosphere.

The only means available to quantify the non-linear climate
response  is  by  using  numerical  models  of  the  climate  system
based  on  well-established  physical, chemical  and  biological
principles, possibly  combined  with  empirical  and  statistical
methods.

1.3.2  Modelling  and  Projection  of  Anthropogenic  Climate 

Change

Climate models
The behaviour of the climate system, its components and their
interactions, can be studied and simulated using tools known as
climate models. These are designed mainly for studying climate
processes and natural climate variability, and for projecting the
response  of  the  climate  to  human-induced  forcing.  Each
component or coupled combination of components of the climate
system can be represented by models of varying complexity. 

The  nucleus  of  the  most  complex  atmosphere  and  ocean
models, called  General  Circulation  Models  (Atmospheric
General  Circulation  Models  (AGCMs)  and  Ocean  General
Circulation  Models  (OGCMs))  is  based  upon  physical  laws
describing the dynamics of atmosphere and ocean, expressed by
mathematical  equations.  Since  these  equations  are  non-linear,
they need to be solved numerically by means of well-established
mathematical techniques. Current atmosphere models are solved
spatially on a three-dimensional grid of points on the globe with

a horizontal resolution typically of 250 km and some 10 to 30
levels  in  the  vertical.  A  typical  ocean  model  has  a  horizontal
resolution of 125 to 250 km and a resolution of 200 to 400 m in
the  vertical.  Their  time-dependent  behaviour  is  computed  by
taking  time  steps  typically  of  30  minutes.  The  impact  of  the
spatial  resolution  on  the  model  simulations  is  discussed  in
Section 8.9 of Chapter 8.

Models  of  the  various  components  of  the  climate  system
may  be  coupled  to  produce  increasingly  complex  models. The
historical development of such coupled climate models is shown
in Box 3 of the Technical Summary. Processes taking place on
spatial and temporal scales smaller than the model’s resolution,
such as individual clouds or convection in atmosphere models, or
heat transport through boundary currents or mesoscale eddies in
ocean models, are included through a parametric representation
in terms of the resolved basic quantities of the model. Coupled
atmosphere-ocean models, including such parametrized physical
processes, are  called  Atmosphere-Ocean  General  Circulation
Models  (AOGCMs).  They  are  combined  with  mathematical
representations  of  other  components  of  the  climate  system,
sometimes based on empirical relations, such as the land surface
and  the  cryosphere.  The  most  recent  models  may  include
representations of aerosol processes and the carbon cycle, and in
the  near  future  perhaps  also  the  atmospheric  chemistry.  The
development of these very complex coupled models goes hand in
hand with the availability of ever larger and faster computers to
run  the  models.  Climate  simulations  require  the  largest, most
capable computers available.

A  realistic  representation  of  the  coupling  between  the
various components of the climate system is essential. In partic-
ular the coupling between the atmosphere and the oceans is of
central importance. The oceans have a huge heat capacity and a
decisive  influence  on  the  hydrological  cycle  of  the  climate
system, and  store  and  exchange  large  quantities  of  carbon
dioxide.  To  a  large  degree  the  coupling  between  oceans  and
atmosphere determines the energy budget of the climate system.
There have been difficulties modelling this coupling with enough
accuracy  to  prevent  the  model  climate  unrealistically  drifting
away  from  the  observed  climate.  Such  climate  drift  may  be
avoided by adding an artificial correction to the coupling, the so-
called “flux adjustment”. The evaluation in Chapter 8 of recent
model results identifies improvements since the SAR, to the point
that there is a reduced reliance on such corrections, with some
recent models operating with minimal or no adjustment.

For various reasons, discussed in Section 8.3 of Chapter 8, it
is important to also develop and use simpler models than the fully
coupled comprehensive AOGCMs, for example to study only one
or a specific combination of components of the climate system or
even  single  processes, or  to  study  many  different  alternatives,
which  is  not  possible  or  is  impractical  with  comprehensive
models. In IPCC (1997) a hierarchy of models used in the IPCC
assessment  process  was  identified  and  described, differing  in
such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to
which physical processes are explicitly represented, the level to
which  empirical  parametrization  is  involved, and  the  computa-
tional costs of running the models. In the IPCC context, simple
models are also used to compute the consequences of greenhouse

The Climate System: an Overview

95

gas emission scenarios. Such models are tuned to the AOGCMs
to give similar results when globally averaged.

Projections of climate change
Climate  models  are  used  to  simulate  and  quantify  the  climate
response to present and future human activities. The first step is
to simulate the present climate for extended simulation periods,
typically  many  decades, under  present  conditions  without  any
change in external climate forcing.

The  quality  of  these  simulations  is  assessed  by  systemati-
cally comparing the simulated climate with observations of the
present climate. In this way the model is evaluated and its quality
established. A  range  of  diagnostic  tools  has  been  developed  to
assist  the  scientists  in  carrying  out  the  evaluation.  This  step  is
essential to gain confidence in and provide a baseline for projec-
tions  of  human-induced  climate  change.  Models  may  also  be
evaluated by running them under different palaeoclimate (e.g. Ice
Age)  conditions.  Chapter  8  of  this  report  presents  a  detailed
assessment of the latest climate models of various complexity, in
particular  the  AOGCMs.  Once  the  quality  of  the  model  is
established, two  different  strategies  have  been  applied  to  make
projections of future climate change.

The  first, so-called  equilibrium  method  is  to  change, e.g.
double, the carbon dioxide concentration and to run the model
again to a new equilibrium. The differences between the climate
statistics  of  the  two  simulations  provide  an  estimate  of  the
climate change corresponding to the doubling of carbon dioxide,
and of the sensitivity of the climate to a change in the radiative
forcing. This  method  reduces  systematic  errors  present  in  both
simulations.  If  combined  with  simple  slab  ocean  models, this
strategy is relatively cheap because it does not require long runs
to reach equilibrium. However it does not provide insight in to the
time dependence of climate change. 

The second, so-called transient, method, common nowadays
with improved computer resources, is to force the model with a
greenhouse  gas  and  aerosol  scenario.  The  difference  between
such simulation and the original baseline simulation provides a
time-dependent projection of climate change.

This transient method requires a time-dependent profile of
greenhouse  gas  and  aerosol  concentrations.  These  may  be
derived from so-called emission scenarios. Such scenarios have
been developed, among others by IPCC, on the basis of various
internally  coherent  assumptions  concerning  future  socio-
economic and demographic developments. In the SAR the IPCC
Scenarios IS92 were used (IPCC, 1994). The most recent IPCC
emission scenarios are described in the IPCC Special Report on
Emission Scenarios (Nakic´enovic´ et al., 2000). Different assump-
tions concerning e.g. the growth of the world population, energy
intensity and efficiency, and economic growth, lead to consider-
ably different emission scenarios. For example the two extreme
estimates  in  the  IPCC  IS92  scenarios  of  the  carbon  dioxide
emission by 2100 differ by a factor of 7. Because scenarios by
their very nature should not be used and regarded as predictions,
the term “climate projections” is used in this Report.

Transient  simulations  may  also  be  based  on  artificially
constructed, so-called  idealised, scenarios.  For  example,
scenarios have been constructed, assuming a gradual increase of

greenhouse  gas  concentrations  followed  by  stabilisation  at
various  levels.  Climate  simulations  based  on  such  idealised
scenarios  may  provide  insight  in  to  the  climate  response  to
potential policy measures leading to a stabilisation of the GHG
concentrations, which  is  the  ultimate  objective  of  the  United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
as formulated in its Article 2. See Section 3 of Chapter 9 for an
assessment.

Projections  from  present  models  show  substantial
agreement, but  at  the  same  time  there  is  still  a  considerable
degree of ambiguity and difference between the various models.
All models show an increase in the globally averaged equilibrium
surface temperature and global mean precipitation. In Chapter 9
the  results  of  various  models  and  intercomparison  projects  are
assessed.  Model  results  are  more  ambiguous  about  the  spatial
patterns  of  climate  change  than  about  the  global  response.
Regional patterns depend significantly on the time dependence of
the forcing, the spatial distribution of aerosol concentrations and
details  of  the  modelled  climate  processes.  Research  tools  have
been  developed  to  generate  more  reliable  regional  climate
information.  These  tools  and  their  results  are  presented  and
assessed in Chapter 10.

To  study  the  impact  of  climate  change, a  plausible  and
consistent  description  of  a  possible  future  climate  is  required.
The construction of such climate change scenarios relies mainly
on results from model projections, although sometimes informa-
tion from past climates is used. The basis for and development of
such scenarios is assessed in Chapter 13. Global and regional sea-
level change scenarios are reviewed in Chapter 11.

Predictability, global and regional
In  trying  to  quantify  climate  change, there  is  a  fundamental
question  to  be  answered: is  the  evolution  of  the  state  of  the
climate system predictable? Since the pioneering work by Lorenz
in the 1960s, it is well known that complex non-linear systems
have  limited  predictability, even  though  the  mathematical
equations  describing  the  time  evolution  of  the  system  are
perfectly deterministic.

The climate system is, as we have seen, such a non-linear
complex system with many inherent time scales. Its predictability
may depend on the type of climate event considered, the time and
space  scales  involved  and  whether  internal  variability  of  the
system or variability from changes in external forcing is involved.
Internal variations caused by the chaotic dynamics of the climate
system may be predictable to some extent. Recent experience has
shown that the ENSO phenomenon may possess a fair degree of
predictability for several months or even a year ahead. The same
may be true for other events dominated by the long oceanic time-
scales, such  as  perhaps  the  NAO.  On  the  other  hand, it  is  not
known, for example, whether the rapid climate changes observed
during  the  last  glacial  period  are  at  all  predictable  or  are
unpredictable consequences of small changes resulting in major
climatic shifts.

There  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  climate  variations  on  a
global  scale  resulting  from  variations  in  external  forcing  are
partly  predictable.  Examples  are  the  mean  annual  cycle  and
short-term climate variations  from individual volcanic eruptions,

96

The Climate System: an Overview

which  models  simulate  well.  Regularities  in  past  climates, in
particular  the  cyclic  succession  of  warm  and  glacial  periods
forced  by  geometrical  changes  in  the  Sun-Earth  orbit, are
simulated by simple models with a certain degree of success. The
global  and  continental  scale  aspects  of  human-induced  climate
change, as  simulated    by  the  models  forced  by  increasing
greenhouse  gas  concentration, are  largely    reproducible.
Although this is not an absolute proof, it provides evidence that
such externally forced climate change may be predictable, if their
forcing mechanisms are known or can be predicted.

Finally, global  or  continental  scale  climate  change  and
variability may be more predictable than regional or local scale
change, because the climate on very large spatial scales is less
influenced  by  internal  dynamics, whereas  regional  and  local
climate is much more variable under the influence of the internal
chaotic dynamics of the system. See Chapter 7 for an assessment
of the predictability of the climate system.

Rapid climate change
A non-linear system such as the climate system may exhibit rapid
climate  change  as  a  response  to  internal  processes  or  rapidly
changing  external  forcing.  Because  the  probability  of  their
occurrence may be small and their predictability limited, they are
colloquially  referred  to  as  “unexpected  events” or  “surprises”.
The abrupt events that took place during the last glacial cycle are
often cited as an example to demonstrate the possibility of such
rapid climate change. Certain possible abrupt events as a result of
the rapidly increasing anthropogenic forcing could be envisioned.
Examples  are  a  possible  reorganization  of  the  thermohaline
ocean  circulation  in  the  North  Atlantic  resulting  in  a  more
southerly  course  of  the  Gulf  Stream, which  would  have  a
profound influence on the climate of Western Europe, a possible
reduction of upper-level ocean cycling in the Southern Ocean, or
a possible but unlikely rapid disintegration of part of the Antarctic
ice sheet with dramatic consequences for the global sea level.

More generally, with a rapidly changing external forcing, the
non-linear climate system may experience as yet unenvisionable,
unexpected, rapid change. Chapter 7, in particular Section 7.7, of
this Report reviews and assesses the present knowledge of non-
linear events and rapid climate change. Potential rapid changes in
sea level are assessed in Chapter 11.

1.3.3 Observing Anthropogenic Climate Change

earth-observation satellites have been launched, providing a wide
range  of  observations  of  various  components  of  the  climate
system all over the globe. The correct interpretation of such data
still  requires  high  quality  in  situ and  surface  data.  The  longer
observational  records  suffer  from  changes  in  instrumentation,
measurement  techniques, exposure  and  gaps  due  to  political
circumstances or wars. Satellite data also require compensation
for orbital and atmospheric transmission effects and for instru-
mental  biases  and  instabilities.  Earlier  the  problems  related  to
urbanisation were mentioned. To be useful for the detection of
climate  change, observational  records  have  to  be  adjusted
carefully for all these effects.

Concern has been expressed about the present condition of
the  observational  networks.  The  number  of  upper-air  observa-
tions, surface stations and observations from ships is declining,
partly  compensated  for  by  an  increasing  number  of  satellite
observations.  An  increasing  number  of  stations  are  being
automated, which  may  have  an  impact  on  the  quality  and
homogeneity of the observations. Maintaining and improving the
quality and density of existing observational networks is essential
for necessary high standard information. In order to implement
and  improve  systematic  observations  of  all  components  of  the
climate system, the World Meteorological Organization and the
International  Oceanographic  Commission  have  established  a
Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Initially GCOS uses
existing  atmospheric, oceanic  and  terrestrial  networks.  Later
GCOS  will  aim  to  amplify  and  improve  the  observational
networks where needed and possible.

Observations alone are not sufficient to produce a coherent
and global picture of the state of the climate system. So-called
data assimilation systems have been developed, which combine
observations and their temporal and spatial statistics with model
information to provide a coherent quantitative estimate in space
and time of the state of the climate system. Data assimilation also
allows  the  estimation  of  properties  which  cannot  easily  be
observed  directly  but  which  are  linked  to  the  observations
through  physical  laws.  Some  institutions  have  recently
reanalysed several decades of data by means of the most recent
and most sophisticated version of their data assimilation system,
avoiding  in  this  way  inhomogenities  due  to  changes  in  their
system. However inhomogeneities in these reanalyses may still
exist  due  to  changing  sources  of  information, such  as  the
introduction of new satellite systems.

Observing the climate
The  question  naturally  arises  whether  the  system  has  already
undergone  human-induced  climate  change.  To  answer  this
question, accurate  and  detailed  observations  of  climate  and
climate variability are required. Instrumental observations of land
and ocean surface weather variables and sea surface temperature
have been made increasingly widely since the mid-19th century.
Recently, ships’ observations  have  been  supplemented  by  data
from  dedicated  buoys.  The  network  of  upper-air  observations,
however, only became widespread in the late 1950s. The density
of  observing  stations  always  has  been  and  still  is  extremely
inhomogeneous, with many stations in densely populated areas
and virtually none in huge oceanic areas. In recent times special

The 20th century
Historically, human activities such as deforestation may have had
a local or regional impact, but there is no reason to expect any
large  human  influence  on  the  global  climate  before  the  20th
century.  Observations  of  the  global  climate  system  during  the
20th  century  are  therefore  of  particular  importance.  Chapter  2
presents evidence that there has been a mean global warming of
0.4 to 0.8°C of the atmosphere at the surface since the late 19th
century.  Figure  2.1  of  Chapter  2  shows  that  this  increase  took
place in two distinct phases, the first one between 1910 and 1945,
and  recently  since  1976.  Recent  years  have  been  exceptionally
warm, with  a  larger  increase  in  minimum  than  in  maximum
temperatures possibly related, among other factors, to an increase

in  cloud  cover.  Surface  temperature  records  indicate  that  the
1990s are likely to have been the warmest decade of the millen-
nium in the Northern hemisphere, and 1998 is likely to have been
the warmest year. For instrumentally recorded history, 1998 has
been the warmest year globally. Concomitant with this tempera-
ture increase, sea level has risen during the 20th century by 10 to
20 cm and there has been a general retreat of glaciers worldwide,
except in a few maritime regions, e.g. Norway and New Zealand
(Chapter 11).

Regional changes are also apparent. The observed warming
has  been  largest  over  the  mid-  and  high-latitude  continents  in
winter  and  spring.  Precipitation  trends  vary  considerably
geographically  and, moreover, data  in  most  of  the  Southern
Hemisphere  and  over  the  oceans  are  scarce.  From  the  data
available, it appears that precipitation has increased over land in
mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, especially
during  winter  and  early  spring, and  over  most  Southern
Hemisphere  land  areas.  Over  the  tropical  and  the  Northern
Hemisphere  subtropical  land  areas, particularly  over  the
Mediterranean  region  during  winter, conditions  have  become
drier. In contrast, over large parts of the tropical oceans rainfall
has increased.

There is considerable variability of the atmospheric circula-
tion  at  long  time-scales. The  NAO  for  example, with  its  strong
influence  on  the  weather  and  climate  of  extratropical  Eurasia,
fluctuates on multi-annual and multi-decadal time-scales, perhaps
influenced by varying temperature patterns in the Atlantic Ocean.
Since the 1970s the NAO has been in a phase that gives stronger
westerly winds in winter. Recent ENSO behaviour seems to have
been  unusual  compared  to  that  of  previous  decades: there  is
evidence  that  El  Niño  episodes  since  the  mid-1970s  have  been
relatively more frequent than the opposite La Niña episodes.

There  are  suggestions  that  the  occurrence  of  extreme
weather events has changed in certain areas, but a global pattern
is not yet apparent. For example, it is likely that in many regions
of  the  world, both  in  the  Northern  and  Southern  Hemisphere,
there has been a disproportionate increase in heavy and extreme
precipitation  rates  in  areas  where  the  total  precipitation  has
increased. Across most of the globe there has been a decrease in
the frequency of much below-normal seasonal temperatures.

A  detailed  assessment  of  observed  climate  variability  and
change  may  be  found  in  Chapter  2, and  of  observed  sea  level
change  in  Chapter  11.  Figure  2.39  of  Chapter  2  summarises
observed variations in temperature and the hydrological cycle.

Detection and attribution
The fact that the global mean temperature has increased since the
late 19th century and that other trends have been observed does
not necessarily mean that an anthropogenic effect on the climate
system  has  been  identified.  Climate  has  always  varied  on  all
time-scales, so  the  observed  change  may  be  natural.  A  more
detailed  analysis  is  required  to  provide  evidence  of  a  human
impact.

Identifying  human-induced  climate  change  requires  two
steps.  First  it  must  be  demonstrated  that  an  observed  climate
change  is  unusual  in  a  statistical  sense.  This  is  the  detection
problem. For this to be successful one has to know quantitatively

how climate varies naturally. Although estimates have improved
since  the  SAR, there  is  still  considerable  uncertainty  in  the
magnitude of this natural climate variability. The SAR concluded
nevertheless, on the basis of careful analyses, that “the observed
change in global mean, annually averaged temperature over the
last century is unlikely to be due entirely to natural fluctuations
of the climate system”. 

Having detected a climatic change, the most likely cause of
that change has to be established. This is the attribution problem.
Can  one  attribute  the  detected  change  to  human  activities, or
could it also be due to natural causes? Also attribution is a statis-
tical  process.  Neither  detection  nor  attribution  can  ever  be
“certain”, but only probable in a statistical sense. The attribution
problem  has  been  addressed  by  comparing  the  temporal  and
spatial patterns of the observed temperature increase with model
calculations based on anthropogenic forcing by greenhouse gases
and aerosols, on the assumption that these patterns carry a finger-
print  of  their  cause.  In  this  way  the  SAR  found  that  “there  is
evidence of an emerging pattern of climate response to forcing by
greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols in the observed climate
record”. Since the SAR new results have become available which
tend  to  support  this  conclusion.  The  present  status  of  the
detection  of  climate  change  and  attribution  of  its  causes  is
assessed in Chapter 12.

1.4 A ‘Road-map’ to this Report

This Report, the third IPCC Working Group I Assessment Report
since 1990, assesses the state of scientific understanding of the
climate  system  and  its  variability  and  change, in  particular
human-induced  climate  change.  This  section  provides  a  ‘road
map’ to the 14 chapters of this report and the major issues they
are  designed  to  address.  Each  chapter  provides  an  initial
summary  of  the  Working  Group  I  Second  Assessment  Report
(IPCC, 1996) and then goes on to emphasise the progress made
since then. The chapters can be viewed as covering the following
three  broad  areas: past changes  and  the  factors  that  can  force
climate change (Chapters 2 to 6), our present understanding and
ability to model the climate system (Chapters 7, 8 and 14) and
possible future climate change (Chapters 9 to 13).

In  order  to  understand, assess  and  quantify  the  possible
human  influence  on  climate, an  analysis  of  past  climate
variability  and  change  is  required  (Chapter  2).  The  chapter
tackles such questions as: how much is the world warming and is
the recent global warming unusual?  It looks in detail at trends
and variability during the recent instrumental period (the last 100
years or so) and draws on palaeo-data to put them into the context
of climate over much longer periods.

There are many factors that are known to influence climate,
both natural and human-induced. The increase in concentrations
of  greenhouse  gases  and  aerosols  through  human  activity  is  of
particular concern. Chapters 3 to 5 examine how well the three
most important human contributions to the changing composition
of the atmosphere; carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases and
aerosols, are  understood, including  the  physical, chemical  and
biological processes which determine the atmospheric concentra-
tions of these components. The next step, taken in Chapter 6, is

to  evaluate  how  this  change  in  atmospheric  composition  has
affected radiative forcing within the context of other factors such
as land-use change, volcanic eruptions and solar variations.

Understanding the climate response to these various radiative
forcings  and  projecting  how  they  could  affect  future  climate
requires an understanding of the physical processes and feedbacks
in the climate system and an ability to model them (Chapter 7).
The only tools available for such projections of future climate are
numerical models of the climate system of various complexity. An
evaluation of such models against observations of the present and
past  climate  and  model  intercomparisons  provide  the  basis  for
confidence in such tools (Chapter 8).

Climate models together with scenarios of future emissions
of radiatively active atmospheric components, as for example the
SRES scenarios (Nakic´enovic´ et al., 2000), recently developed by
IPCC  specifically  for  this  purpose, are  used  to  project  future
climate change. State-of-the-art projections for the next 100 years
are  assessed  in  Chapter  9, mainly  at  a  global  level, but  also
including  large-scale  patterns, their  spatial  and  temporal
variability and extreme events. Partly in response to the need for
more details of climate change at a regional level, research in this
area  has  been  particularly  active  over  the  last  5  years. A  new
chapter, compared  to  previous  assessments, has  been  included
which  examines  the  various  techniques  available  to  derive
regional climate projections and, as far as is currently possible,
assesses  regional  climate  change  information  (Chapter  10).
Chapter 11 assesses the current state of knowledge of the rate of
change  of  global  average  and  regional  sea  level  in  response  to
climate change.

A  key  conclusion  from  the  SAR  was  that  “the  balance  of
evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on
global climate”. Chapter 12 assesses research over the last 5 years
on the detection and attribution of climate change drawing on the
developments  in  observational  research  (Chapters  2  to  6)  and
modelling (Chapters 7 to 10) to consider how this conclusion has
changed.

Data derived directly from projections with climate models
are  often  inappropriate  for  assessing  the  impacts  of  climate
change which can require detailed, regional or local information
as  well  as  observational  data  describing  current  (or  baseline)
climate. Climate change scenarios are plausible representations
of  future  climate  constructed  explicitly  for  impact  assessment
and form a key link between IPCC Working Groups I and II. For
the first time, Working Group I have included a chapter dedicated
to climate scenarios (Chapter 13) − this is intended to provide an
assessment  of  scenario  generation  techniques, rather  than  to
present scenarios themselves.

All  chapters  of  the  report  highlight  areas  of  certainty  and
uncertainty, and  gaps  in  current  knowledge.  Chapter  14  draws
together  this  information  to  present  key  areas  that  need  to  be
addressed to advance understanding and reduce uncertainty in the
science of climate change.

A comprehensive and integrated summary of all results of
this assessment report may be found in the Technical Summary
in this volume. A brief summary highlighting points of particular
policy relevance is presented in the Summary for Policymakers.

Executive Summary

Overview

The best estimate of global surface temperature change is a 0.6°C
increase since the late 19th century with a 95% confidence interval
of 0.4 to 0.8°C. The increase in temperature of 0.15°C compared
to  that  assessed  in  the  IPCC  WGI  Second  Assessment  Report
(IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) is partly due to the additional data
for the last five years, together with improved methods of analysis
and the fact that the SAR decided not to update the value in the
First Assessment Report, despite slight additional warming. It is
likely  that  there  have  been  real  differences  between  the  rate  of
warming in the troposphere and the surface over the last twenty
years, which are not fully understood. New palaeoclimate analyses
for the last 1,000 years over the Northern Hemisphere indicate that
the magnitude of 20th century warming is likely to have been the
largest of any century during this period. In addition, the 1990s are
likely to have been the warmest decade of the millennium. New
analyses indicate that the global ocean has warmed significantly
since the late 1940s: more than half of the increase in heat content
has occurred in the upper 300 m, mainly since the late 1950s. The
warming  is  superimposed  on  strong  global  decadal  variability.
Night minimum temperatures are continuing to increase, length-
ening  the  freeze-free  season  in  many  mid-  and  high  latitude
regions. There has been a reduction in the frequency of extreme
low temperatures, without an equivalent increase in the frequency
of extreme high temperatures. Over the last twenty-five years, it is
likely  that  atmospheric  water  vapour  has  increased  over  the
Northern  Hemisphere  in  many  regions.  There  has  been  quite  a
widespread reduction in daily and other sub-monthly time-scales
of temperature variability during the 20th century. New evidence
shows a decline in Arctic sea-ice extent, particularly in spring and
summer. Consistent with this finding are analyses showing a near
40% decrease in the average thickness of summer Arctic sea ice
over approximately the last thirty years, though uncertainties are
difficult to estimate and the influence of multi-decadal variability
cannot  yet  be  assessed. Widespread  increases  are  likely  to  have
occurred  in  the  proportion  of  total  precipitation  derived  from
heavy and extreme precipitation events over land in the mid- and
high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. 

Changes in Temperature and Related Variables

Changes in near-surface temperature from the instrumental
record
• Average  global  surface  temperature  has  increased  by  approx-
imately 0.6°C since the late 19th century, with 95% confidence
limits  of  close  to  0.4  and  0.8°C.  Most  of  this  increase  has
occurred  in  two  periods, from  about  1910  to  1945  and  since
1976, and  the  largest  recent  warming  is  in  the  winter  extra-
tropical  Northern  Hemisphere.  The  warming  rate  since  1976,
0.17°C/decade, has been slightly larger than the rate of warming
during the 1910 to 1945 period (0.14°C/decade), although the
total  increase  in  temperature  is  larger  for  the  1910  to  1945
period. The most recent warming period also has a faster rate of
warming over land compared with the oceans. The high global

temperature associated with the 1997/98 El Niño event stands
out in both surface and tropospheric temperatures as an extreme
event, even after consideration of the recent rate of warming.

• Confidence in the magnitude of global warming since the late
19th century has increased since the SAR due to new analyses,
including  model  simulations  of  land-surface  temperature
changes and new studies of the effect of urbanisation on global
land  temperature  trends. There  is  a  high  level  of  consistency
between changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and near-
surface land air temperatures across the land-ocean boundary
over the 20th century, despite independent observing systems
and independent bias correction factors for SSTs before 1942.
The  assessed  warming  is  considerably  larger  than  the  total
contributions of the plausible sources of error.

• Twentieth century temperature trends show a broad pattern of
tropical warming, while extra-tropical trends have been more
variable.  Warming  from  1910  to  1945  was  initially  concen-
trated in the North Atlantic and nearby regions. The Northern
Hemisphere  shows  cooling  during  the  period  1946  to  1975
while  the  Southern  Hemisphere  shows  warming.  The  recent
1976 to 2000 warming was largely globally synchronous, but
emphasised  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  continents  during
winter  and  spring, with  year-round  cooling  in  parts  of  the
Southern  Hemisphere  oceans  and  Antarctica.  North  Atlantic
cooling  between  about  1960  and  1985  has  recently  reversed.
Overall, warming  over  the  Southern  Hemisphere  has  been
more uniform during the instrumental record than that over the
Northern Hemisphere.

• The patterns of global temperature change since the 1970s are
related  in  part  to  the  positive  westerly  phase  of  the  North
Atlantic/Arctic  Oscillation  and  possibly  to  decadal  to  multi-
decadal variability in the Pacific.

• A multi-decadal fluctuation of SST in the North Atlantic has
been in a rising phase since about the mid-1980s. Warming in
many  regions  of  this  ocean  has  accelerated  over  the  last  five
years and is likely to have contributed to quite rapid parallel
increases of near-surface air temperature in much of Europe.

• New  analysis  shows  that  the  global  ocean  heat  content  has
increased since the late 1950s. This increase is superimposed
on  substantial  global  decadal  variability.  More  than  half  the
heating is contained in the uppermost 300 m where it is equiva-
lent to an average temperature increase of 0.037°C/decade.

• Analyses of mean daily maximum and minimum land surface
air temperatures continue to support a reduction in the diurnal
temperature range in many parts of the world, with, globally,
minimum temperatures increasing at nearly twice the rate of
maximum  temperatures  between  about  1950  and  1993.  The
rate of temperature increase during this time has been 0.1°C
and 0.2°C for the maximum and minimum, respectively. This
is  about  half  of  the  rate  of  temperature  increase  over  the
oceans during this time.

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Changes in temperature-related variables
• Alpine  and  continental  glaciers  have  extensively  retreated  in
response to 20th century warming. Glaciers in a few maritime
regions are advancing, mainly due to increases in precipitation
related to atmospheric circulation changes, e.g., Norway, New
Zealand. 

• The  duration  of  Northern  Hemisphere  lake-ice  and  river-ice
cover  over  the  past  century, or  more, shows  widespread
decreases averaging to about two fewer weeks of ice cover.

• There is a highly significant interannual (+0.6) and multi-decadal
correlation between increases in the Northern Hemisphere spring
land  temperature  and  a  reduction  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere
spring snow cover since data have been available (1966). Snow
cover extent has decreased by about 10% since 1966.

• A 10 to 15% reduction in sea-ice extent in the Arctic spring and
summer  since  the  1950s  is  consistent  with  an  increase  in
spring, and to a lesser extent, summer temperatures in the high
latitudes.  There  is  little  indication  of  reduced  Arctic  sea-ice
extent during winter when temperatures have increased in the
surrounding region.

• New data from submarines indicate that there has been about a
40%  decline  in  Arctic  sea-ice  thickness  in  summer  or  early
autumn between the period 1958 to 1976 and the mid-1990s, an
average of near 4 cm per year. Other independent observations
show  a  much  slower  decrease  in  winter  sea-ice  thickness  of
about 1 cm per year. The influence of substantial interannual
and  inter-decadal  variability  on  these  changes  cannot  be
assessed because of restricted sampling.

• By contrast, there is no readily apparent relationship between
decadal  changes  in Antarctic  temperatures  and  sea-ice  extent
since  1973.  Satellite  data  indicate  that  after  a  possible  initial
decrease in the mid-1970s, Antarctic sea-ice extent has stayed
almost stable or even increased since 1978.

Changes in temperature above the surface layer
• Analysis of global temperature trends since 1958 in the low to
mid-troposphere  from  balloons  shows  a  warming  of  about
+0.1°C/decade, which is similar to the average rate of warming
at the surface. Since the early 1960s no significant trends have
been  detected  for  the  global  mean  temperature  in  the
uppermost troposphere. 

• Satellites have only been available since 1979. Between 1979
and  2000, based  on  satellites  and  balloons, the  lower-tropo-
spheric  trend  has  been  +0.04  ± 0.11°C/decade  and  0.03  ±
0.10°C/decade, respectively. By contrast, surface temperature
trends for 1979 to 2000 were greater, at 0.16 ± 0.06°C/decade.
The  trend  in  the  difference  of  the  surface  and  lower-tropo-
spheric  series  of  0.13 ± 0.06°C/decade  is  clearly  statistically
significant. This is in contrast to near zero surface temperature
trends over 1958 to 1978 when the global lower-tropospheric
temperature warmed by 0.03°C/decade relative to the surface. 

• It is very likely that these significant differences in trends between
the  surface  and  lower  troposphere  are  real  and  not  solely  an
artefact of measurement bias, though differences in spatial and
temporal  sampling  are  likely  to  contribute. The  differences  are
particularly apparent in many parts of the tropics and sub-tropics
where the surface has warmed faster than the lower troposphere.
In some other regions, e.g., North America, Europe and Australia,
lower-tropospheric and surface trends are very similar.

• Throughout the stratosphere, negative temperature trends have
been observed since 1979, ranging from a decrease of 0.5 or
0.6°C/decade in the lower stratosphere to 2.5°C/decade in the
upper stratosphere.

Changes in temperature during the pre-instrumental period

The past millennium
• New  analyses  indicate  that  the  magnitude  of  Northern
Hemispher  warming  over  the  20th  century  is  likely  to  have
been the largest of any century in the last 1,000 years. 

• The 1990s are likely to have been the warmest decade of the
millennium in the Northern Hemisphere and 1998 is likely to
have  been  the  warmest  year.  Because  less  data  are  available,
less is known about annual averages prior to 1,000 years before
the  present  and  for  conditions  prevailing  in  most  of  the
Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.

• Evidence does not support the existence of globally synchro-
nous periods of cooling or warming associated with the ‘Little
Ice Age’ and ‘Medieval Warm Period’. However, reconstructed
Northern Hemisphere temperatures do show a cooling during
the 15th to 19th centuries and a relatively warm period during
the 11th to 14th centuries, though the latter period is still cooler
than the late 20th century. 

• Analyses  of  borehole  temperatures  indicate  a  non-linear
increase  in  global  average  ground  surface  temperature  over
land of 1.0 ± 0.3°C over the last 500 years, with most of the
increase  occurring  since  the  late  19th  century. There  may  be
additional  uncertainties  due  to  the  assumptions  used  in  this
technique, and  decreasing  resolution  back  in  time  limits
confidence in the exact timing of the warming.

Changes across the last 500,000 years
• It  is  very  likely  that  large  and  rapid  decadal  temperature
changes  occurred  during  the  last  glacial  and  its  deglaciation
(between about 100,000 and 10,000 years ago), particularly in
higher  latitudes  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  During  the  last
deglaciation, local increases in temperature are likely to have
been as large as 5 to 10°C over a few decades. Over the same
period there is evidence of less pronounced but nearly synchro-
nous changes worldwide, except in high southern latitudes. 

• Antarctic ice cores have provided new evidence of almost in-
phase  changes  of  temperature, carbon  dioxide  and  methane
through the ice age cycles over the past 420,000 years. 

Observed Climate Variability and Change

103

• There  is  emerging  evidence  for  significant, rapid  (time-
scales  of  several  decades  or  more), regional  temperature
changes  during  the  last  10,000  years.  However, the
evidence does not indicate that any such events were global
in scale. 

Changes in Precipitation and Related Variables

Precipitation
• Instrumental  records  of  land-surface  precipitation  continue
to  show  an  increase  of  0.5  to  1%/decade  in  much  of  the
Northern  Hemisphere  mid-  and  high  latitudes.  A  notable
exception includes parts of eastern Russia. In contrast, over
much  of  the  sub-tropical  land  areas  rainfall  has  decreased
during the 20th century (by −0.3%/decade), but this trend has
weakened  in  recent  decades.  Other  precipitation  indicators
suggest that large parts of the tropical oceans have had more
precipitation  in  recent  decades, and  that  precipitation  has
significantly  increased  over  tropical  land  areas  during  the
20th  century  (2.4%/century).  The  increase  in  precipitation
over the tropics is not evident during the past few decades.

• In the Southern Hemisphere, the pattern of island rainfall in
parts of the South Pacific has changed since the mid-1970s,
associated with the more frequent occurrence of the warm
phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

• Where  data  are  available, changes  in  annual  streamflow

usually relate well to changes in total precipitation. 

Water vapour
• Changes in water vapour mixing ratio have been analysed
for  selected  regions  using  in  situ surface  observations  as
well  as  lower-tropospheric  measurements  based  on
satellites and weather balloons. A pattern of overall surface
and lower-tropospheric water vapour mixing ratio increases
over the past few decades is emerging, although there are
likely to be some time-dependent biases in these data and
regional  variations  in  trends.  The  more  reliable  data  sets
show  that  it  is  likely  that  total  atmospheric  water  vapour
has increased several per cent per decade over many regions
of the Northern Hemisphere since the early 1970s. Changes
over the Southern Hemisphere cannot yet be assessed.

• Satellite observations of upper-tropospheric humidity from
1980  to  1997  show  statistically  significant  positive  trends
of  0.1%/year  for  the  zone  10°N  to  10°S.  Other  trends  are
not  statistically  significant, but  include  a  0.04%/year
positive  trend  for  the  zone  60°N  to  60°S  but  a  negative
trend of –0.1%/year over the region 30°S to 60°S.

• Balloon  observations  of  stratospheric  water  vapour  above
18  km  show  an  increase  of  about  1%/year  for  the  period
from 1981 to 2000. Shorter satellite records show a similar
positive  trend, suggesting  that  the  change  is  global  in
character, but  they  also  indicate  a  slowing  of  the  positive
trend after 1996. 

Clouds
• It is likely that there has been an increase in total cloud cover
of about 2% over many mid- to high latitude land areas since
the beginning of the 20th century. The increases in total cloud
amount are positively correlated with decreases in the diurnal
temperature range. Changes in total cloud amount are uncertain
both over sub-tropical and tropical land areas as well as over
the oceans.

Changes in Atmospheric/Oceanic Circulation

El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
• The frequency and intensity of ENSO has been unusual since the
mid-1970s compared with the previous 100 years. Warm phase
ENSO episodes have been relatively more frequent, persistent,
or intense than the opposite cold phase during this period. 

• This recent behaviour of ENSO is related to variations in precip-
itation and temperature over much of the global tropics and sub-
tropics and some mid-latitude areas. The overall effect is likely
to  have  made  a  small  contribution  to  the  increase  in  global
surface temperature during the last few decades. 

Other Oscillations
• The  Inter-decadal  Pacific  Oscillation  is  likely  to  be  a  Pacific-
wide manifestation of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Both are
associated  with  decadal  climate  variability  over  the  Pacific
basin. It is likely that these related phenomena modulate ENSO-
related climate variability.

• The winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associ-
ated Arctic  Oscillation  (AO), which  appear  to  be  largely  the
same phenomenon, show decadal to multi-decadal variability.
Since  the  1970s  these  oscillations  have  been  in  a  phase  that
gives  stronger  westerly  winds  over  much  of  extra-tropical
Eurasia  in  the  winter  half  year.  This  is  associated  with  cold
season  warming  over  extra-tropical  Eurasia, but  cooling  in
some regions further south. 

• The High Latitude Mode (HLM) or Antarctic Oscillation (AAO)
in the Southern Hemisphere has been in an enhanced positive
phase in the last fifteen years, with stronger westerly winds over
the Southern Ocean. 

• It is likely that rapid (time-scales of several decades or more)
changes of atmospheric and ocean circulation occurred during
inter-glacial periods, affecting regional climate, without human
interference.

Changes in Extreme (within the upper or lower ten percentiles)
Weather and Climate Events

Precipitation
• New analyses show that in regions where total precipitation has
increased  it  is  very  likely  that  there  have  been  even  more
pronounced increases in heavy and extreme precipitation events.
The converse is also true. 

104

Observed Climate Variability and Change

• In some regions, heavy and extreme precipitation events have
increased despite the fact that total precipitation has decreased
or  remained  constant.  This  is  attributed  to  a  decrease  in  the
frequency of precipitation events. Changes in the frequency of
heavy precipitation events can arise from several causes, e.g.,
changes in atmospheric moisture or circulation.

• Over the latter half of the 20th century it is likely that there has
been a 2 to 4% increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation
events reported by the available observing stations in the mid-
and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

• Trends for severe drought and wet area statistics for 1900 to
1995  are  relatively  small  over  global  land  areas.  However,
during  the  last  two  or  three  decades  there  have  been  some
increases in the globally combined severe dry and wet areas.

Temperature
• In  many  regions  inter-daily  temperature  variability  has
decreased.  Increases  in  the  daily  minimum  temperatures  are

lengthening  the  freeze-free  season  in  most  mid-  and  high
latitude regions. 

• A  significant  reduction  in  the  frequency  of  extreme  low
monthly  and  seasonal  average  temperatures  across  much  of
the globe has occurred since the late 19th century. However,
a relatively smaller increase in the frequency of extreme high
monthly  and  seasonal  average  temperatures  has  been
observed.

Storms
• Changes  in  tropical  and  extra-tropical  storm  intensity  and
frequency  are  dominated  by  inter-decadal  to  multi-decadal
variations, with  no  significant  trends  over  the  20th  century
evident. Conflicting analyses make it difficult to draw defini-
tive conclusions about changes in storm activity, especially in
the extra-tropics.

• No systematic changes in the frequency of tornadoes, thunder

days, or hail events are evident in the limited areas analysed.

2.1  Introduction

2.2  How Much is the World Warming?

Observed climate change and variability (for definitions, see the
IPCC  Glossary, Appendix  I)  are  considered  in  this  chapter  by
addressing  seven  commonly  asked  questions  related  to  the
detection  of  climate  change  and  sensitivity  of  the  climate  to
anthropogenic activity. The questions are:

How much is the world warming?
Is the recent warming unusual?
How rapidly did climate change in the distant past?
Have precipitation and atmospheric moisture changed?
Are the atmospheric/oceanic circulations changing?
Has climate variability, or have climate extremes, changed?
Are the observed trends internally consistent?

This  chapter  emphasises  change  against  a  background  of
variability. The certainty of conclusions that can be drawn about
climate from observations depends critically on the availability of
accurate, complete  and  consistent  series  of  observations.  For
many  variables  important  in  documenting, detecting, and
attributing climate change, Karl et al. (1995a) demonstrate that
the data are still not good enough for really firm conclusions to
be  reached, as  noted  in  the  IPCC  WGI  Second  Assessment
Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR). This especially applies to
global trends in variables that have large regional variations, such
as precipitation, whereas conclusions about temperature changes
are  often  considerably  more  firmly  based.  The  recently
designated Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) upper air
network (Wallis, 1998) and a GCOS surface network (Peterson et
al., 1997), maintained  and  reporting  to  higher  standards, may
have had a limited positive impact on the quality and availability
of some of our results. New data sets e.g., on surface humidity,
sea-ice  thickness  and  sub-surface  ocean  temperature, have
widened  the  range  of  conclusions  than  can  be  drawn  since  the
SAR, albeit  tentatively.  However, a  wider  range  of  analytical
techniques and tests of the data have increased our confidence in
areas such as surface temperature changes.

Throughout  the  chapter  we  try  to  consistently  indicate  the
degree of our confidence in trends and other results. Sometimes
we  provide  quantitative  estimates  of  uncertainty, as  far  as
possible  the  value  of  twice  the  standard  error, or  we  estimate
statistical  significance  at  the  0.05  (5%)  level.  This  is  the
appropriate  terminology  and  implies  that  what  we  see  is  very
unusual, given the null hypothesis. We use the word “trend” to
designate  a  generally  progressive  change  in  the  level  of  a
variable. Where numerical values are given, they are equivalent
linear trends, though more complex changes in the variable will
often be clear from the description. We use the word “consistent”
to imply similarity between results or data sets that are expected
to be related on physical grounds. Where this is not possible, we
use  the  following  words  to  indicate  judgmental  estimates  of
confidence: virtually certain (>99% chance that a result is true);
very  likely  (≥90%  but  ≤99%  chance);  likely  (>66%  but  <90%
chance); medium likelihood (>33% but ≤66% chance), unlikely
(>10% but ≤33% chance); very unlikely (≥1% but ≤10% chance)
and exceptionally unlikely (<1% chance).

2.2.1  Background

The SAR concluded that, on a global average, land-surface air
and  sea  surface  temperature  rose  by  between  0.3°C  and  0.6°C
between the late 19th century and 1994. In this section, the recent
warming is re-examined, using updated data. We include recent
analyses  of  the  diurnal  asymmetry  of  the  warming  and  its
geographical  structure.  Conventional  temperature  observations
are  supplemented  by  indirect  evidence  and  by  satellite-based
data. For the first time, we make objective estimates of uncertain-
ties in the surface temperature data, though these are preliminary.
We also assess recent work in compiling hemispheric and global
temperature records from palaeoclimatic data, especially for the
most recent millennium. 

2.2.2  Temperature in the Instrumental Record for Land and 

Oceans

Note that all data sets are adjusted to have zero anomaly when
averaged over the period 1961 to 1990.

2.2.2.1  Land-surface air temperature
The SAR reviewed the three databases of land-surface air temper-
ature  due  to  Jones  (1994), Hansen  and  Lebedeff  (1988)  and
Vinnikov et al. (1990). The first and second databases have been
updated by Jones et al. (2001) and Hansen et al. (1999), respec-
tively, and a further analysis has become available (Peterson and
Vose, 1997;  Peterson  et  al., 1998a, 1999).  The  last  paper  also
separates  rural  temperature  stations  in  the  Global  Historical
Climatology Network (GHCN) (Peterson and Vose, 1997) from
the  full  set  of  stations  which, in  common  with  the  other  three
analyses, have been screened for urbanisation effects. While there
is  little  difference  in  the  long-term  (1880  to  1998)  rural
(0.70°C/century)  and  full  set  of  station  temperature  trends
(actually less at 0.65°C/century), more recent data (1951 to 1989),
as cited in Peterson et al. (1999), do suggest a slight divergence
in  the  rural  (0.80°C/century)  and  full  set  of  station  trends
(0.92°C/century). However, neither pair of differences is statisti-
cally significant. In addition, while not reported in Peterson et al.,
the  1951  to  1989  trend  for  urban  stations  alone  was
0.10°C/decade. We conclude that estimates of long-term (1880 to
1998)  global  land-surface  air  temperature  variations  and  trends
are  relatively  little  affected  by  whether  the  station  distribution
typically used by the four global analyses is used, or whether a
special  effort  is  made  to  concentrate  on  rural  stations  using
elaborate criteria to identify them. Part of the reason for this lack
of  sensitivity  is  that  the  average  trends  in  available  worldwide
urban stations for 1951 to 1989 are not greatly more than those
for  all  land  stations  (0.09°C/decade).  The  differences  in  trend
between  rural  and  all  stations  are  also  virtually  unaffected  by
elimination of areas of largest temperature change, like Siberia,
because such areas are well represented in both sets of stations. 
These results confirm the conclusions of Jones et al. (1990)
and  Easterling  et  al.  (1997)  that  urban  effects  on  20th  century

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Box 2.1: Urban Heat Island and the Observed Increases in Land Air Temperature.

There are two primary reasons why urban heat islands have been suspected as being partially responsible for the observed increases
in land air temperatures over the last few decades.  The first is related to the observed decrease in the diurnal temperature range and
the second is related to a lower rate of warming observed over the past twenty years in the lower troposphere compared with the
surface.

Since the 1950s both daily maximum and minimum temperatures are available over more than 50% of the global land area.  These
data indicate that on average the mean minimum temperature has increased at nearly twice the rate of the maximum temperature,
reducing the daily temperature range by about 0.8°C over these areas.  This has raised questions related to whether the growth of
urban heat islands may be responsible for a substantial portion of the observed mean temperature increase, because it is well-known
that compared to non-urban areas urban heat islands raise night-time temperatures more than daytime temperatures.  Nonetheless,
the relatively strong correlation between observed decreases in the daily temperature range with increases of both precipitation
(leading to more moist surface conditions) and total cloud amount support the notion that the reduction in diurnal temperature range
is in response to these physical changes. 

Since 1979 satellite observations and weather balloons (which generally agree well) show substantially less warming of the global
lower troposphere (around 2 km) than surface temperatures (0.03 and 0.04°C/decade, respectively, compared to 0.16°C/decade at the
surface). However, over the Northern Hemisphere land areas where urban heat islands are most apparent, both the trends of lower-
tropospheric temperature and surface air temperature show no significant differences. In fact, the lower-tropospheric temperatures
warm  at  a  slightly  greater  rate  over  North America  (about  0.28°C/decade  using  satellite  data)  than  do  the  surface  temperatures
(0.27°C/decade), although again the difference is not statistically significant. In the global average, the trend differences arise largely
from the tropical and sub-tropical oceans. In many such regions, the near-surface marine air temperatures tend to be cool and dense
compared with conditions aloft, allowing for the lapse rate with height, disconnecting near-surface (up to about 1 km) conditions from
higher layers in the atmosphere. Thus the surface marine layer and the troposphere above can have differing variations and trends.

Clearly, the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas.  Extensive tests
have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05°C up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in
this chapter to depict climate change. Thus we have assumed an uncertainty of zero in global land-surface air temperature in 1900
due to urbanisation, linearly increasing to 0.06°C (two standard deviations 0.12°C) in 2000.

series do not exceed about 0.05°C over the period 1900 to 1990
(assumed  here  to  represent  one  standard  error  in  the  assessed
non-urban  trends).  However, greater  urbanisation  influences  in
future  cannot  be  discounted.  Note  that  changes  in  borehole
temperatures  (Section  2.3.2), the  recession  of  the  glaciers
(Section  2.2.5.4), and  changes  in  marine  temperature  (Section
2.2.2.2), which are not subject to urbanisation, agree well with
the  instrumental  estimates  of  surface  warming  over  the  last
century. Reviews of the homogeneity and construction of current
surface  air  temperature  databases  appear  in  Peterson  et  al.
(1998b)  and  Jones  et  al.  (1999a).  The  latter  shows  that  global
temperature anomalies can be converted into absolute tempera-
ture values with only a small extra uncertainty. 

Figure  2.1a  shows  the  Jones  et  al. (2001)  CRU  (Climatic
Research Unit) annual averages, together with an approximately
decadally  smoothed  curve, to  highlight  decadal  and  longer
changes. This is compared with smoothed curves from the other
three analyses in Figure 2.1b. We do not show standard errors for
the CRU land data using the Jones et al. (1997b) method as tests
suggest that these may not be reliable for land data on its own.
Instead  we  use  an  optimum  averaging  method  (Folland  et  al.,
2001)  where  the  calculated  uncertainties  are  centred  on  the
simple  CRU  average.  We  have  added  an  estimate  of  the
additional, independent, uncertainty  (twice  the  standard  error)

due  to  urbanisation  increasing  from  zero  in  1900  to  0.12°C  in
2000. (The Jones et al. (1990) estimates can be interpreted as one
standard error equal to 10% of the global warming to that time of
about  0.05oC, see  also  Box  2.1  on  urbanisation.)  Note  that  the
warming substantially exceeds the calculated uncertainties. (We
have not included the possible refinement of assuming urbanisa-
tion uncertainties to apply to the cold side of the trend line only,
which would reduce the total uncertainty range in Figure 2.1.) 

Over global land, a further warming of surface air tempera-
ture has occurred since the SAR. The Peterson and Vose (1997)
NCDC  (National  Climate  Data  Center)  series  gives  distinctly
more warming than does the CRU series since the mid-1980s. The
former  series  is  a  straightforward  average  of  local  land  areas,
weighted  according  to  their  size, whereas  the  CRU  series  is  a
simple average of the two hemispheres which gives more weight
to  the  relatively  small  area  of  the  Southern  Hemisphere  land.
Because the Northern Hemisphere land has warmed considerably
faster  than  the  Southern  Hemisphere  land  since  the  mid-1980s
(reflected  in  Table  2.1), the  simple  average  results  in  less
warming. The Hansen et al. (1999) GISS (Goddard Institute for
Space Studies) series has recently been revised and shows a little
less warming than the CRU series since the late 1980s. One reason
for  this  behaviour  lies  in  the  way  that  the  Hansen  series  is
constructed. Among other differences, this series gives much more

Observed Climate Variability and Change

107

weight to oceanic islands and Antarctica. Because the oceans and
Antarctica have warmed less than the rest of the global land in the
last fifteen years (see below), the Hansen series can be expected to
show  less  warming.  Some  of  these  considerations  apply  to  the
Vinnikov et al. (1990) SHI (State Hydrological Institute) series,
though this excludes areas south of 60°S.

A  new  record  was  set  in  all  four  series  in  1998  (anomalies
relative to 1961 to 1990 of CRU, 0.68°C; NCDC, 0.87°C; GISS,
0.58°C;  and  SHI, 0.58°C).  1998  was  influenced  by  the  strong
1997/98  El  Niño;  the  warming  influence  of  El  Niño  on  global
temperature is empirically well attested (e.g., Jones, 1994) and the
physical causes are starting to be uncovered (Meehl et al., 1998).
However, 1998  was  considerably  warmer  than  1983, a  year
warmed  by  the  comparable  1982/83  El  Niño.  In  fact  1998  was
between 0.34 and 0.54°C warmer than 1983 over land, depending
on the temperature series used, though there was some offsetting
cooling from volcanic aerosols from the 1982 El Chichon eruption
in  1983.  1999  was  globally  much  cooler  than  1998, with  an
anomaly  of  0.40°C  in  the  CRU  series, as  it  was  cooled  by  the
strongest  La  Niña  since  1988/89.  Despite  its  relative  coolness,
1999 was still the fifth warmest year in the CRU record. Depending
on the record used, 1999 was between 0.11°C and 0.33°C warmer
than  the  last  comparable  La  Niña  year, 1989.  It  is  noteworthy,
however, that north of 20°N, 1999 was nearly as warm as 1998.
Mitigation of the warming trend in the early 1990s was short-lived
and  was  mainly  due  to  the  cooling  influence  of  the  eruption  of
Mount Pinatubo in 1991 (Parker et al., 1996), highlighted in the
SAR. The ten warmest years in all four records have occurred after
1980, six or seven of them in the 1990s in each series. 

Based on the CRU series, equivalent linear trends in global,
Northern  and  Southern  Hemisphere  land-surface  air  temperature
are shown in Table 2.1. Because warming may not persist at the
rates  shown, all  trends  are  shown  in  °C/decade.  The  two  main
periods of warming in all three series are between about 1910 to
1945 and between 1976 to 2000 (updated from Karl et al., 2000).
Trends have been calculated using a restricted maximum likelihood
method (Diggle et al., 1999) that allows for serial correlation in the
data.  It  gives  larger  standard  errors  than  ordinary  least  squares
methods when data have a complex temporal structure, as is true
here.  Table  2.1  and  Figure  2.1  show  that  the  rate  of  global  and
hemispheric warming in land-surface air temperature from 1976 to
2000 was about twice as fast (but interannually more variable) than
that for the period 1910 to 1945. However, trends over such short
periods are very susceptible to end effects so the values in Table
2.1, and Table 2.2 below, should be viewed with caution for these
periods. Both periods of warming are statistically significant, as is
(easily)  the  warming  since  1861  or  1901.  Uncertainties  in  the
annual values due to data gaps, including an additional estimate of
uncertainties due to urbanisation, are included for land-surface air
temperature but equivalent uncertainties are not currently available
for  the  marine  data  alone.  Thus  estimates  in  Table  2.1  for  the
marine data may be conservative, though the effect of adding the
influence  of  annual  uncertainties  to  the  land-surface  air  temp-
erature data trends was small. The period 1946 to 1975 had no
significant change of temperature, though there was a small non-
significant, but  regionally  more  marked, cooling  over  the
Northern Hemisphere, as discussed by Parker et al. (1994).

Figure 2.1: (a) Annual anomalies of global average land-surface air
temperature (oC), 1861 to 2000, relative to 1961 to 1990 values. Bars
and solid curve are from CRU (Jones et al., 2001). Values are the
simple average of the anomalies for the two hemispheres. The
smoothed curve was created using a 21-point binomial filter giving near
decadal averages. (b) As (a) but smoothed curves only from NCDC
(updated from Peterson and Vose, 1997) – thin solid curve; GISS
(adapted from Hansen et al., 1999) – thick dashed curve; SHI (updated
from Vinnikov et al., 1990) – thin dashed curve to 1999 only; Peterson
and Vose (1997) – thin solid curve. Thick solid curve – as in (a). Two
standard error uncertainties are centred on the CRU curve and are
estimated using an optimum averaging method (Folland et al., 2001)
and include uncertainties due to urbanisation but not due to uncertain-
ties in thermometer exposures. The NCDC curve is the weighted
average of the two hemispheres according to the area sampled, which
accounts for most of the differences from the CRU curve.

The equivalent linear changes in global average CRU land-
surface air temperature over 1861 to 2000 and 1901 to 2000 that
take into account annual sampling errors and uncertainties due
to  urbanisation  are  0.63  ± 0.24°C  and  0.61  ± 0.18°C  respec-
tively.  Corresponding  Northern  and  Southern  Hemisphere
changes for 1901 to 2000 are 0.71 ± 0.31°C and 0.52 ± 0.13°C,
respectively. Marine surface temperatures are discussed further
in Section 2.2.2.2.

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Table 2.1: Restricted maximum likelihood linear trends in annual average land-surface air temperature (LSAT) anomalies from CRU and sea surface
temperature (SST) and night marine air temperature (NMAT) anomalies from the UK Met Office (UKMO). Twice the standard errors of the trends
are shown in brackets. Trends significant at the 5% level or better, according to calculations made using an appropriate form of the t test, are shown
in bold type. The significances of the trends are indicated beneath their twice standard errors. The method for calculating the trends, standard errors
and significances allows for serial correlation and can result in a trend for the globe that is not exactly equal to the average of the trends for the
hemispheres, consistent with uncertainties in the trends. The estimates of trends and errors for the land data account for uncertainties in the annual
anomalies due to data gaps and urbanisation. Uncertainties in annual marine anomalies are not available. Trends are given in °C/decade.

Maximum and minimum temperature
As reported in the SAR, and updated by Easterling et al. (1997),
the increase in temperature in recent decades has involved a faster
rise in daily minimum than daily maximum temperature in many
continental regions. This gives a decrease in the diurnal tempera-
ture  range  (DTR)  in  many  parts  of  the  world. The  analysis  by
Easterling et al. (1997) increased total global coverage from 37%
to 54% of global land area. Large parts of the world have still not
been analysed due to a lack of observations or inaccessible data,
particularly  in  the  tropics.  Updating  all  the  data  remains  a
problem, so the analysis ends in 1993. 

The  overall  global  trend  for  the  maximum  temperature
during 1950 to 1993 is approximately 0.1°C/decade and the trend
for  the  minimum  temperature  is  about  0.2°C/decade.
Consequently, the trend in the DTR is about −0.1°C/decade. The
rate  of  temperature  increase  for  both  maximum  and  minimum
temperature over this period is greater than for the mean temper-
ature over the entire 20th century, reflecting the strong warming
in recent decades. Note that these trends for 1950 to 1993 will
differ from the global trends due to the restricted data coverage
so we only quote trends to 0.1°C.

Since  the  DTR  is  the  maximum  temperature  minus  the
minimum temperature, the DTR can decrease when the trend in
the maximum or minimum temperature is downward, upward, or
unchanging. This contributes to less spatial coherence on the DTR
map than on maps of mean temperature trend. Maximum temper-
atures have increased over most areas with the notable exception
of eastern Canada, the southern United States, portions of Eastern

and southern Europe (Brunetti et al., 2000a), southern China, and
parts  of  southern  South  America.  Minimum  temperatures,
however, increased almost everywhere except in eastern Canada
and small areas of Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The DTR
decreased in most areas, except over middle Canada, and parts of
southern Africa, south-west Asia, Europe, and the western tropical
Pacific Islands. In some areas the pattern of temperature change
has  been  different.  In  both  New  Zealand  (Salinger, 1995)  and
central Europe (Weber et al., 1994; Brázdil et al., 1996) maximum
and  minimum  temperatures  have  increased  at  similar  rates.  In
India the DTR has increased due to a decrease in the minimum
temperature (Kumar et al., 1994). Eastern Canada also shows a
slight  increase  in  DTR  due  to  a  stronger  cooling  in  maximum
temperatures relative to minimum temperatures (Easterling et al.,
1997). However, recently annual mean maximum and minimum
temperatures  for  Canada  have  been  analysed  using  newly
homogenised  data  (Vincent, 1998;  Vincent  and  Gullet, 1999);
these have increased by 0.3 and 0.4°C, respectively, over the last
fifty years (Zhang et al., 1999). Central England temperature also
shows no decrease in DTR since 1878 (Parker and Horton, 1999).
Similarly, a  new  temperature  data  set  for  north-east  Spain  (not
available on Figure 2.2 below, Brunet-India et al., 1999a,b), shows
an  increase  in  maximum  temperature  over  1913  to  1998  to  be
about  twice  as  fast  as  that  of  minimum  temperature.  Recent
analyses by Quintana-Gomez (1999) reveal a large reduction in
the  DTR  over  Venezuela  and  Colombia, primarily  due  to
increasing  minimum  temperatures  (up  to  0.5°C/decade). In
northern China, the decrease in DTR is due to a stronger warming

Figure. 2.2: Trends in annual diurnal temperature range (DTR, °C/decade), from 1950 to 1993, for non-urban stations only, updated from
Easterling et al. (1997). Decreases are in blue and increases in red. This data set of maximum and minimum temperature differs from and 
has more restricted coverage than those of mean temperature used elsewhere in Section 2.2.

in minimum temperature compared with maximum temperatures.
However, in southern China the decreased DTR is due to a cooling
in  maximum  with  a  slight  warming  in  minimum  temperature
(Zhai and Ren, 1999).

The DTR is particularly susceptible to urban effects. Gallo et
al. (1996) examined differences in DTR between stations based
on  predominant  land  use  in  the  vicinity  of  the  observing  site.
Results show statistically significant differences in DTR between
stations associated with predominantly rural land use/land cover
and those associated with more urban land use/land cover, with
rural  settings  generally  having  larger  DTR  than  urban  settings.
Although this shows that the distinction between urban and rural
land use is important as one of the factors that can influence the
trends observed in temperatures, Figure 2.2 shows annual mean
trends  in  diurnal  temperature  range  in  worldwide  non-urban
stations  over  the  period  1950  to  1993  (from  Easterling  et  al.,
1997). The trends for both the maximum and minimum tempera-
tures are about 0.005°C/decade smaller than the trends for the full
network  including  urban  sites, which  is  consistent  with  earlier
estimated  urban  effects  on  global  temperature  anomaly  time-
series (Jones et al., 1990). 

Minimum  temperature  for  both  hemispheres  increased
abruptly in the late 1970s, coincident with an apparent change
in  the  character  of  the  El  Niño-Southern  Oscillation  (ENSO)
phenomenon, giving  persistently  warmer  sea  temperatures  in
the  tropical  central  and  east  Pacific  (see  Section  2.6.2).
Seasonally, the strongest changes in the DTR were in the boreal
winter (−0.13°C/decade for rural stations) and the smallest changes
were  during  boreal  summer  (−0.065°C/decade), indicating  some
seasonality in the changes. Preliminary extensions of the Easterling
et  al.  (1997)  analysis  to  1997  show  that  the  declining  trends  in
DTR have continued in much of North America and Asia.

Figure  2.3  shows  the  relationship  between  cloudiness  and
the DTR for a number of regions where long-term cloud cover
data are available (Dai et al., 1997a). For each region there was
an increase in cloud cover over the 20th century and generally a

annual  cloud  cover  and  annual  DTR  is  remarkably  strong,
suggesting a distinct relationship between cloud cover and DTR.

increases in tropospheric aerosol loadings have been implicated
in  some  of  these  cloud  cover  changes, while  the  aerosols
themselves  can  cause  small  changes  in  DTR  without  cloud
changes (Hansen et al., 1998 and Chapter 6).

2.2.2.2  Sea surface temperature and ocean air temperature
The analyses of SST described here all estimate the sub-surface
bulk temperature, (i.e. the temperature in the first few metres of
the  ocean)  not  the  skin  temperature.  Thus  the  Reynolds  and
Smith  (1994)  and  Smith  et  al. (1996)  data, which  incorporate
polar  orbiting  satellite  temperatures, utilise  skin  temperatures
that have been adjusted to estimate bulk SST values through a
calibration procedure.

Many  historical  in  situ marine  data  still  remain  to  be
digitised and incorporated into the database, to improve coverage
and reduce the uncertainties in our estimates of marine climatic
variations. A combined physical-empirical method (Folland and
Parker, 1995) is used, as in the SAR, to estimate adjustments to
ships’ SST data obtained up to 1941 to compensate for heat losses
from  uninsulated  (mainly  canvas)  or  partly-insulated  (mainly
wooden) buckets  (see Box 2.2). The corrections are independent
of the land-surface air temperature data. Confirmation that these
spatially and temporally complex adjustments are quite realistic
globally is emerging from simulations of the Jones (1994) land-
surface  air  temperature  anomalies  using  the  Hadley  Centre
atmospheric climate model HadAM3 forced with observed SST
and  sea-ice  extents  since  1871, updated  from  Rayner  et  al.
(1996).  Figure  2.4  (Folland  et  al., 2001)  shows  simulations  of
global  land-surface  air  temperature  anomalies  in  model  runs
forced with SST, with and without bias adjustments to the SST
data  before  1942.  All  runs  with  uncorrected  SST  (only  the
average is shown) give too cold a simulation of land-surface air
temperature for much of the period before 1941 relative to the
1946 to 1965 base period, with a dramatic increase in 1942. All

Figure 2.4: Tests of bias adjustments to sea surface temperature (SST)
using a climate model (Folland et al., 2001). Black line - annual mean
observed land surface air temperature (SAT) anomaly (oC) from a 1946
to 1965 average (Jones, 1994), a period before major anthropogenic
warming. Red line – annual averages of four simulations of SAT
anomalies using uncorrected SST data, 1872 to 1941, and an average of
six simulations for 1941 to 1998. Blue line – average of six simulations
of SAT, forced with SST data corrected up to 1941 (Folland and Parker,
1995). Simulated data are collocated with available observations.

six individual runs with bias-adjusted SST (only the average is
shown)  give  simulated  land  air  temperatures  close  to  those
observed  so  that  internal  model  variability  is  small  on  decadal
time-scales  compared  to  the  signal  being  sought. These  global
results are mostly confirmed by ten similar large regional land-
surface  air  temperature  analyses  (not  shown).  Hanawa  et  al.
(2000) have provided independent confirmation of the SST bias
corrections around Japan. Therefore, our confidence in the SST
data sets has increased. Marine data issues are discussed further
in Box 2.2, in Trenberth et al. (1992) and Folland et al. (1993).
Figure  2.5a  shows  annual  values  of  global  SST, using  a
recently improved UKMO analysis that does not fill regions of
missing  data  (Jones  et  al., 2001), together  with  decadally
smoothed values of SST from the same analysis. NMAT is also
shown. These generally agree well after 1900, but NMAT data
are warmer before that time with a slow cooling trend from 1860
not seen in the SSTs, though the minimum around 1910 is seen
in both series. The SST analysis from the SAR is also shown. The
changes in SST since the SAR are generally fairly small, though
the peak warmth in the early 1940s is more evident in the more
recent analysis, supported by the NMAT analysis. A contribution
to decadally averaged global warmth at that time is likely to have
arisen from closely spaced multiple El Niño events centred near
1939 to 1941 and perhaps 1942 to 1944 (Bigg and Inonue, 1992;
and Figure 2.29). The NMAT data largely avoid daytime heating
of  ships’ decks  (Bottomley  et  al., 1990;  Folland  and  Parker,
1995).  Although  NMAT  data  have  been  corrected  for  warm
biases in World War II they may still be too warm in the Northern
Hemisphere  at  that  time  (Figure  2.5c), though  there  is  good
agreement  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  (Figure  2.5d).  The
NMAT analysis is based on that in Parker et al. (1995) but differs
from that used in the SAR in that it incorporates optimal inter-
polated  data  using  orthogonal  spatial  patterns  (eigenvectors).
This is similar to the technique described by Kaplan et al. (1997,
1998)  but  with  additional  allowance  for  non-stationarity  of  the
data (Parker et al, 1995). Great care is needed in making these
reconstructions in a changing climate, as pointed out by Hurrell
and  Trenberth  (1999).  This  NMAT  analysis  has  been  chosen
because of the often very sparse data. NMAT confirms the SST
trends in the 20th century until 1991 (see also Table 2.1). After
1991, NMAT warmed at a slower rate than SST in parts of the
Southern Hemisphere, notably the South Indian and the tropical
South Pacific Oceans. Overall, however, the SST data should be
regarded as more reliable, though the relative changes in NMAT
since 1991 may be partly real (Christy et al., 2001). The similar
trends in SST and island air temperature found by Folland et al.
(1997) for four regions of the tropical and extra-tropical South
Pacific over much of the last century support the generally greater
reliability of the SST data.

Figure 2.5b shows three time-series of changes in global SST.
The  UKMO  series  (as  in  Figure  2.5a)  does  not  include  polar
orbiting satellite data because of possible time-varying biases in
them that remain difficult to correct fully (Reynolds, 1993) though
the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) data
(adapted from Smith et al., 1996 and Reynolds and Smith, 1994),
starting in 1950, do include satellite data after 1981. The NCDC
series  (updated  from  Quayle  et  al., 1999)  starts  in  1880  and

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Box 2.2: Adjustments and Corrections to Marine Observations.

The  SST  data  used  here  comprise  over  80  million  observations  from  the  UK  Main  Marine  Data  Bank, the  United  States
Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) and recent information telecommunicated from ships and buoys from the
World Weather Watch. These observations have been carefully checked for homogeneity and carefully corrected for the use of
uninsulated wooden and canvas buckets for collecting seawater prior to 1942. However, corrections prior to about 1900 are less
well known because of uncertainties in the mix of wooden and canvas buckets. Nevertheless, Figure 2.4 provides good evidence
that even in the 1870s, SST was little biased relative to land-surface air temperatures globally. Since 1941, observations mainly
come from ship engine intake measurements, better insulated buckets and, latterly, from buoys. SST anomalies (from a 1961 to
1990 average) are first averaged into 1° latitude by 1° longitude boxes for five-day periods; the anomaly for a given observation is
calculated from a 1° box climatology that changes each day throughout the year. The five-day 1° box anomalies are then aggregated
into 5° boxes for the whole month with outlying values rejected, and monthly average anomalies calculated. Further adjustments
are made to monthly SST anomalies for the varying numbers of observations in each 5° box because when observations are few,
random errors tend to increase the variance of the monthly mean. NMAT data are treated similarly and have quite similar charac-
teristics. However, a variance adjustment to NMAT data is not yet made. NMAT data are also corrected for the progressive increase
in the height of thermometer screens on ships above the ocean surface, though no corrections have been made since 1930. Because
there are only about half as many NMAT as SST data and NMAT have smaller temporal persistence, monthly NMAT anomalies
may be less representative than SST anomalies even on quite large space scales. On longer time-scales, and over the majority of
large ocean regions in the 20th century, there is good agreement between NMAT and SST.  19th century NMAT anomaly time-
series should be viewed cautiously because of the sparse character of the constituent observations, and regionally varying biases,
only some of which have been corrected. 

includes satellite data to provide nearly complete global coverage.
Up to 1981, the Quayle et al series is based on the UKMO series,
adjusted by linear regression to match the NCEP series after 1981.
It has a truly global coverage based on the optimally interpolated
Reynolds and Smith data. The Kaplan et al. (1998) global analysis
is not shown because it makes no allowance for non-stationarity
(here the existance of global warming) in its optimum interpola-
tion procedures, as noted by Hurrell and Trenberth (1999). The
warmest  year  globally  in  each  SST  record  was  1998  (UKMO,
0.43°C, NCDC, 0.39°C, and  NCEP, 0.34°C, above  the  1961  to
1990 average). The latter two analyses are in principle affected by
artificially  reduced  trends  in  the  satellite  data  (Hurrell  and
Trenberth, 1999), though  the  data  we  show  include  recent
attempts  to  reduce  this.  The  global  SST  show  mostly  similar
trends to those of the land-surface air temperature until 1976, but
the trend since 1976 is markedly less (Table 2.1). NMAT trends
are  not  calculated  from  1861, as  they  are  too  unreliable.  The
difference  in  trend  between  global  SST  and  global  land  air
temperature since 1976 does not appear to be significant, but the
trend in NMAT (despite any residual data problems) does appear
to be less than that in the land air temperature since 1976. Figures
2.5c and d show that NMAT and SST trends remain very similar
in the Northern Hemisphere to the end of the record, but diverge
rather suddenly in the Southern Hemisphere from about 1991, as
mentioned above. The five warmest years in each of the UKMO,
NCDC and NCEP SST analyses have occurred after 1986, four of
them in the 1990s in the UKMO analysis. 

Particularly  strong  warming  has  occurred  in  the  extra-
tropical North Atlantic since the mid-1980s (approximately 35°
to  65°N, 0° to  35°W  not  shown). This  warming  appears  to  be
related in part to the warming phase of a multi-decadal fluctua-
tion (Folland et al., 1986, 1999a; Delworth and Mann, 2000; see
Section 2.6), perhaps not confined to the North Atlantic (Minobe,
1997; Chao et al., 2000), though global warming is likely to be

contributing  too.  In  addition, the  cooling  in  the  north-western
North  Atlantic  south  of  Greenland, reported  in  the  SAR, has
ceased. These features were noted by Hansen et al. (1999).

2.2.2.3  Land and sea combined
Figure  2.6  summarises  the  relative  changes  of  UKMO  SST,
UKMO  NMAT  and  CRU  land-surface  air  temperature.  The
greater warming of the land in recent years is clear, but otherwise
all three curves have a generally similar shape except that modest
cooling of NMAT in the late 19th century is not seen in the SST
data  as  noted  for  Figure  2.5. The  relative  coldness  of  the  land
around  1885  to  1895  comes  from  the  Northern  Hemisphere
continental interiors, particularly in winter, as global coastal land
air  temperature  and  adjacent  SST  anomalies  agree  well  at  this
time (Parker et al., 1995), confirmed by the Jones et al. (2001)
data. Note that there are some systematic compensating differ-
ences between the land and SST in the late 19th century in both
hemispheres (not shown). The CRU land data are generally about
0.1  to  0.2°C  colder  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  except  at  the
beginning  of  the  record  (early  1860s), when  they  agree, and
rather colder than this in 1885 to 1890. The opposite is seen in the
Southern Hemisphere before 1885 when SST is generally 0.1 to
0.2°C colder and 0.3°C colder around 1875. Overall the SST data
are  less  variable  in  each  hemisphere  in  these  rather  poorly
observed periods. The Southern Hemisphere land temperature at
this time can actually represent a very small observed area of the
hemisphere  while  the  SST  data, though  sparse, are  generally
considerably more widespread. The sharp cooling in SST around
1903/4 in Figures 2.5 and 2.6, seen in the land as well as the two
ocean surface data sets, was discussed for the North Atlantic and
Indian Oceans by Helland-Hansen and Nansen (1920) not long
after the event. The reduced warming of the NMAT in the last
decade reflects differences in the Southern Hemisphere discussed
above.  Slightly  greater  warming  of  the  global  ocean  than  the

Figure 2.6: Smoothed annual anomalies of global average sea surface temperature (°C) 1861 to 2000, relative to 1961 to 1990 (blue curve), night
marine air temperature (green curve), and land-surface air temperature (red curve). The data are from UK Met Office and CRU analyses (adapted
from Jones et al., 2001, and Parker et al., 1995). The smoothed curves were created using a 21-point binomial filter giving near-decadal averages.
Also shown (inset) are the smoothed differences between the land-surface air and sea surface temperature anomalies.

global  land  in  1910  to  1945  (seen  in  Table  2.1)  is  within  the
uncertainties of either data set, as a slightly slower warming of
the ocean might be expected on physical grounds. 

Figures  2.7a  to  c  show  annual  time-series  of  anomalies  of
combined  land-surface  air  temperature  and  SST  for  the
hemispheres and globe since 1861, based on the latest CRU land
air temperature data and the UKMO SST data. Jones et al. (2001)
temperature data have been averaged by both a standard weighting
method, used  in  the  SAR, as  shown  by  the  dashed  smoothed
curves, and by an optimum averaging method (Shen et al., 1998;
Folland  et  al., 2001)  as  shown  by  the  bars  and  solid  smoothed
curves.  The  latter  method  uses  the  variance-covariance  matrix
instead  of  correlation  functions  (Kagan, 1997).  The  calculated
uncertainties  (twice  the  standard  error)  in  the  annual  values  are
also shown (including the independent urbanisation and SST bias
correction uncertainties). Optimum averaging gives less weight to
areas  of  high  data  uncertainty  than  do  ordinary  averaging
methods, and  it  takes  much  better  account  of  data  gaps.  It  also
gives more weight to Antarctica, the great bulk of which (away
from  the Antarctic  Peninsula)  has  warmed  little  in  the  last  two
decades (Comiso, 2000). Optimum averages can affect individual

years markedly when data are sparse. Thus extra warmth of the
warm year 1878 (strongly affected by the 1877/78 El Niño) in the
Northern relative to the Southern Hemisphere in the area weighted
average (not shown) disappears when optimum averages are used.
In  the  Northern  Hemisphere, the  optimum  averages  are  little
different from area weighted averages, but they are consistently
warmer  in  the  sparsely  sampled  Southern  Hemisphere  before
1940, often by more than one tenth of a degree. The overall effect
on global temperature is small, however (Figure 2.7c)

The five warmest global optimally averaged years since the
beginning  of  the  record  in  1861  all  occurred  in  the  1990s  with
1998 having the warmest anomaly (0.55°C). This year was signif-
icantly  warmer  than  the  second  warmest  year, 1995  (0.38°C),
while 1999 was fourth warmest year, despite the strong La Niña
event. The remarkably consistent monthly global warmth of 1998
is discussed in Karl et al. (2000).

Table  2.2  shows  linear  trends  of  the  annual  optimum
averages, and  twice  their  standard  errors, for  the  globe  and
hemispheres using the restricted maximum likelihood method as
in Table 2.1 and allowing for the annual uncertainties due to data
gaps, urbanisation over land, and bias corrections to SST. Since

1861 the hemispheres have warmed by approximately the same
amount.  However  both  the  earlier  period  of  warming  (1910  to
1945)  and  the  more  recent  one  (1976  to  1999)  saw  rates  of
warming about twice as great in the Northern Hemisphere. There
was  continued  (non-significant)  warming  in  the  Southern
Hemisphere, though  at  a  reduced  rate, in  1946  to  1975, which
partially  offset  (non-significant)  cooling  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere  over  the  same  period  to  give  a  (non-significant)
0.03°C cooling globally. The global trend from 1861 to 2000 can
be  cautiously  interpreted  as  an  equivalent  linear  warming  of
0.61°C  over  the  140-year  period, with  a  95%  confidence  level
uncertainty  of  ±  0.16°C.  From  1901  an  equivalent  warming  of
0.57°C has occurred, with an uncertainty of ± 0.17°C. 

Figure  2.8  shows  a  smoothed  optimally  averaged  annual
global  time-series  with  estimates  of  uncertainty  at  ± twice  the
standard error of the smoothed (near decadal) estimate. Note that
the  optimum  average  uncertainties  increase  in  earlier  years
mainly  because  of  the  much  larger  data  gaps. Also  shown  are
uncertainties estimated by Jones et al. (1997b) using a different
method centred on the Jones et al. (2001) land and sea surface
temperature series. This series uses the average of anomalies from
all  available  grid  boxes, weighted  according  to  grid  box  area.
Therefore, in  contrast  to  the  Jones  et  al.  (2001)  global  land-
surface  air  temperature  data, the  global  land  and  sea  surface
temperature data are not a simple average of the hemispheres. The
optimally averaged uncertainties vary from about 15 to 65% less
than  those  given  by  Jones et  al.  (1997b). This  is  reasonable  as
optimum averages have minimum variance amongst the range of
unbiased  estimates  of  the  average.  Not  surprisingly, there  is
relatively  little  difference  in  the  decadal  averages  themselves.
However  unlike  the  Jones  et  al.  estimates  of  uncertainty, the
optimum average also includes uncertainties in bias corrections to
SST up to 1941 (Folland and Parker, 1995) and the uncertainties
(as included in Figure 2.1) in the land data component that are due
to urbanisation. Cessation of the SST component of uncertainty
after 1941 is the reason for a lack of increase in uncertainties in
the fairly poorly observed period 1942 to 1945. Uncertainties due
to changes in thermometer screens are poorly known but could be
0.1°C globally in the 19th and early 20th centuries (Parker, 1994);
they are not included here, but a preliminary analysis appears in
Folland et al. (2001). For further discussion of changes in land
and ocean surface temperature, see Jones et al. (1999a).

Figure 2.8: Smoothed annual anomalies of global combined land-
surface air and sea surface temperatures (°C), 1861 to 2000, relative to
1961 to 1990, and twice their standard errors. The smoothed curves
and shaded areas were created using a 21-point binomial filter giving
near-decadal averages, with appropriate errors. Optimally averaged
anomalies and uncertainties (Folland et al., 2001) – solid curve and
dark shading; standard area weighted anomalies and uncertainties
(adapted from Jones et al., 1997b, 2001) – dashed curve and light
shading. Note that uncertainties decrease after 1941 due to the
cessation of uncertainties due to bias corrections in sea surface temper-
ature. On the other hand, uncertainties due to urbanisation of the land
component, assessed as zero in 1900, continue to increase after 1941
to a maximum in 2000.

Referring  back  to  Table  2.2  and  including  the  second
decimal place, our best estimate of the equivalent linear rate of
global land and ocean surface warming between 1861 to 2000 is
0.044°C/decade, or a warming of 0.61 ± 0.16°C. Over the period
1901  to  2000, the  equivalent  values  are  0.058°C/decade  or  a
warming of 0.57 ± 0.17°C. These values include the modifying
effects of the annual uncertainties. So we calculate that since the
late 19th or the beginning of the 20th century, up to 2000, global
warming  has  been  0.6  ± 0.2°C.  This  is  0.15°C  more  warming
than the 0.3 to 0.6°C estimated more subjectively up to 1994 by
the  SAR.  This  relatively  large  increase  is  explained  by  the
increase in temperature since the SAR was completed, improved

least 66 of the 100 years. The minimum number of years required for the shorter time periods (1910 to 1945, 1946 to 1975, and 1976 to 2000)

methods of analysis and the fact that the SAR decided not update
the value in the First Assessment Report, despite slight additional
warming. The  latter  decision  was  likely  to  have  been  due  to  a
cautious interpretation of overall uncertainties which had at that
time to be subjectively assessed.

2.2.2.4  Are the land and ocean surface temperature changes 

mutually consistent?

Most of the warming in the 20th century occurred in two distinct
periods  separated  by  several  decades  of  little  overall  globally
averaged  change, as  objectively  identified  by  Karl  et  al.  (2000)
and discussed in IPCC (1990, 1992, 1996) and several references
quoted  therein.  Figures  2.9  and  2.10  highlight  the  worldwide
behaviour of temperature change in the three periods. These linear
trends have been calculated from the Jones et al. (2001) gridded
combination of UKMO SST and CRU land-surface air tempera-
ture, from which the trends in Table 2.2 were calculated. Optimum
averaging has not been used for Figures 2.9 and 2.10, and only
trends  for  grid  boxes  where  reasonably  complete  time-series  of
data exist are shown. The periods chosen are 1910 to 1945 (first

warming period), 1946 to 1975 (period of little global temperature
change), 1976  to  2000  (second  warming  period, where  all  four
seasons are shown in Figure 2.10) and the 20th century, 1901 to
2000. It can be seen that there is a high degree of local consistency
between the SST and land air temperature across the land-ocean
boundary, noting that the corrections to SST (Folland and Parker,
1995)  are  independent  of  the  land  data.  The  consistency  with
which this should be true locally is not known physically, but is
consistent  with  the  similarity  of  larger-scale  coastal  land  and
ocean  surface  temperature  anomalies  on  decadal  time-scales
found by Parker et al. (1995). The warming observed in the period
from 1910 to 1945 was greatest in the Northern Hemisphere high
latitudes, as  discussed  in  Parker  et  al.  (1994).  By  contrast, the
period  from  1946  to  1975  shows  widespread  cooling  in  the
Northern Hemisphere relative to much of the Southern, consistent
with  Tables  2.1  and  2.2  and  Parker  et  al.  (1994).  Much  of  the
cooling was seen in the Northern Hemisphere regions that showed
most  warming  in  1910  to  1945  (Figure  2.9  and  Parker  et  al.,
1994).  In  accord  with  the  results  in  the  SAR, recent  warming
(1976 to 2000) has been greatest over the mid-latitude Northern

Hemisphere continents in winter. However, the updated data shows
only  very  limited  areas  of  year-round  cooling  in  the  north-west
North Atlantic and mid-latitude North Pacific. Over 1901 to 2000
as  a  whole, noting  the  strong  consistency  across  the  land-ocean
boundary, most warming is observed over mid- and high latitude
Asia and parts of western Canada. The only large areas of observed
cooling are just south and east of Greenland and in a few scattered
continental regions in the tropics and sub-tropics. 

Faster  warming  of  the  land-surface  temperature  than  the
ocean  surface  temperature  in  the  last  two  decades, evident  in
Figure 2.6, could in part be a signal of anthropogenic warming (see
Chapters 9 and 12). However, a component, at least in the Northern
Hemisphere  north  of  40  to  45°N, may  result  from  the  sharp
increase in the positive phase of the winter half year North Atlantic
Oscillation  (NAO)/Arctic  Oscillation  (AO)  since  about  1970
(Section  2.6.5), though  this  itself  might  have  an  anthropogenic
component (Chapter 7). There has also been a strong bias to the
warm phase of El Niño since about 1976 (Section 2.6.2). In partic-
ular, Hurrell and van Loon (1997) and Thompson et al. (2000a)
show that the positive phase of the NAO advects additional warm
air over extra-tropical Eurasia north of about 45°N. The positive
phase of the NAO or AO is therefore likely to be a major cause of

the  winter  half-year  warming  in  Siberia  and  northern  Europe  in
Figure 2.10, as also quantified by Hurrell (1996). Cooling over the
western North Atlantic Ocean also occurs, partly due to advection
of  cold  air  in  an  enhanced  north  to  north-west  airflow.  Hurrell
(1996) also shows that the warm phase of El Niño is associated
with  widespread  extra-tropical  continental  warming, particularly
over  North America  and  parts  of  Siberia, with  cooling  over  the
North Pacific Ocean. Both effects are consistent with the strong
warming  over  Siberia  in  winter  in  1976  to  2000  (Figure  2.10),
warming over much of North America and cooling over the Davis
Strait region. Note that some regional details of the seasonal trends
for 1976 to 2000 in Figure 2.10 may be sensitive to small changes
in record length. A test for the shorter period 1980 to 1997 showed
the  same  general  worldwide  pattern  of  (generally  somewhat
reduced) seasonal warming trends as in Figure 2.10, but with some
regional  changes, particularly  over  North  America, almost
certainly related to atmospheric circulation fluctuations. However,
Siberian trends were considerably more robust.

We conclude that in the 20th century we have seen a consis-
tent  large-scale  warming  of  the  land  and  ocean  surface.  Some
regional  details  can  be  explained  from  accompanying
atmospheric circulation changes.

Observed Climate Variability and Change

2.2.2.5  Sub-surface ocean temperatures and salinities 
While the upper ocean temperature and salinity are coupled to the
atmosphere on diurnal and seasonal time-scales, the deep ocean
responds  on  much  longer  time-scales.  During  the  last  decade,
data  set  development, rescue, declassification  and  new  global
surveys  have  made  temperature  and  salinity  profile  data  more
readily available (Levitus et al., 1994, 2000a).

Global
Levitus et al. (1997, 2000b) made annual estimates of the heat
content of the upper 300 m of the world ocean from 1948 through
to 1998 (Figure 2.11). The Atlantic and Indian Oceans each show
a  similar  change  from  relatively  cold  to  relatively  warm
conditions  around  1976. The  Pacific  Ocean  exhibits  more  of  a
bidecadal signal in heat storage. In 1998, the upper 300 m of the
world ocean contained (1.0 ± 0.5) × 1023 Joules more heat than it
did  in  the  mid-1950s, which  represents  a  warming  of  0.3  ±
0.15°C. A least squares linear regression to the annual tempera-
ture  anomalies  from  1958  to  1998  gives  a  warming  of
0.037°C/decade. White et al. (1997, 1998b) computed changes in
diabatic heat storage within the seasonal mixed layer from 1955
to 1996 between 20°S and 60°N and observed a warming of 0.15
± 0.02°C or 0.036°C/decade. 

Extension of the analysis to the upper 3,000 m shows that
similar changes in heat content have occurred over intermediate
and  deep  waters  in  all  the  basins, especially  in  the  North  and
South  Atlantic  and  the  South  Indian  Oceans.  The  change  in
global ocean heat content from the 1950s to the 1990s is equiva-
lent to a net downwards surface heat flux of 0.3 Wm−2 over the
whole period.

Pacific 
The winter and spring mixed-layer depths over the sub-tropical
gyre  of  the  North  Pacific  deepened  30  to  80%  over  the  period
1960  to  1988  (Polovina  et  al., 1995).  Over  the  sub-polar  gyre,
mixed-layer depths reduced by 20 to 30% over the same period.
The surface layer of the sub-polar gyre in the north-east Pacific
has  both  warmed  and  freshened, resulting  in  a  lower  surface
density  (Freeland  et  al., 1997).  Wong  et  al.  (1999)  compared
trans-Pacific data from the early 1990s to historical data collected
about  twenty  years  earlier.  The  changes  in  temperature  and
salinity  are  consistent  with  surface  warming  and  freshening  at
mid-  and  higher  latitudes  and  the  subsequent  subduction
(downward  advection)  of  these  changes  into  the  thermocline.
From 1968/69 and 1990/91, the South Pacific waters beneath the
base of the thermocline have cooled and freshened (Johnson and
Orsi, 1997); the greatest cooling and freshening of −1.0°C and
0.25, respectively, occurred near 48°S and were still observed at
20°S. All the deep water masses show a cooling and freshening
at these high southern latitudes.

Arctic
Recent  surveys  of  the  Arctic  Ocean  (Quadfasel  et  al., 1993;
Carmack  et  al., 1995;  Jones  et  al., 1996)  have  revealed  a  sub-
surface  Atlantic-derived  warm  water  layer  that  is  up  to  1°C
warmer  and  whose  temperature  maximum  is  up  to  100  dbar
shallower than observed from ice camps from the 1950s to the

1980s, as well as from ice-breaker data in the late 1980s and early
1990s. Warming is greatest in the Eurasian Basin. Annual surveys
of the southern Canada Basin since 1979 (Melling, 1998), have
shown a warming and deepening lower Atlantic layer, the lower
halocline layer cooling by 0.12°C and the upper halocline layer
warming  by  0.15°C.  Steele  and  Boyd  (1998)  compared  winter
temperature  and  salinity  profiles  obtained  over  the  central  and
eastern Arctic Basins from submarine transects in 1995 and 1993
with  Soviet  data  collected  over  the  period  1950  to  1989
(Environmental  Working  Group, 1997).  They  showed  that  the
cold halocline waters cover significantly less area in the newer
data.  This  is  consistent  with  a  decreased  supply  of  cold, fresh
halocline waters from the Pacific Shelf areas.

Atlantic
The sub-arctic North Atlantic exhibits decadal variability in both
temperature  and  salinity  (Belkin  et  al., 1998).  Reverdin  et  al.
(1997)  found  that  the  variability  of  salinity  around  the  entire
subarctic gyre for the period 1948 to 1990 was most prominent at
periods of 10 years and longer, and extended from the surface to
below the base of the winter mixed layer. This salinity signal was
only  coherent  with  elsewhere  in  the  north-western Atlantic. A
single spatial pattern explains 70% of the variance of the upper

Observed Climate Variability and Change

ocean salt content of the subarctic gyre, corresponding to a signal
propagating from the west to the north-east. Reverdin et al. also
found  that  fluctuations  in  the  outflow  of  fresh  water  from  the
Arctic are associated with periods of greater or fewer than usual
northerly  winds  east  of  Greenland  or  off  the  Canadian
Archipelago. 

North Atlantic deep waters begin as intermediate waters in
the Nordic seas. These waters have freshened over the 1980s and
1990s  (Bönisch  et  al., 1997).  In  addition, the  absence  of  deep
convection over the same period has caused Nordic Sea bottom
waters  to  become  warmer, saltier  and  less  dense.  The  Faroes-
Shetland Channel is the principal pathway between the north-east
Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea and has been surveyed regularly
since 1893 (Turrell et al., 1999). Unfortunately, the quality of the
salinity  measurements  was  poor  from  1930  through  to  1960.
Since  the  mid-1970s, the  intermediate  and  bottom  waters
entering the North Atlantic through the channel have freshened at
rates of 0.02/decade and 0.01/decade, respectively. The decreased
salinities  have  resulted  in  decreased  water  densities  and  a
decrease  of  between  1  and  7%/decade  in  the  transport  of  deep
water into the North Atlantic. 

In the Labrador Sea, winter oceanic deep convection was
intense  during  the  earlier  1990s, extending  to  deeper  than
2,400 m in 1992 to 1994. This produced a Labrador Sea water
mass colder, denser and fresher than has been observed over at
least the last five decades (Lazier, 1995; Dickson et al., 1996).
Within  the  tropical  and  sub-tropical  gyres  of  the  North
Atlantic, the deep and intermediate water masses are warming.
Ocean station S (south-east of Bermuda, 32°17'N, 64°50'W) has
been  sampled  bi-weekly  since  1954.  Joyce  and  Robins  (1996)
extended the hydrographic record from ocean station S back from
1954  to  1922  using  nearby  observations.  They  find  an  almost
constant rate of warming over the 1,500 to 2,500 dbar layer of
0.05°C/decade  over  the  73-year  period  1922  to  1995.  This
corresponds to a net downward heat flux of 0.7 Wm−2. Sections
completed  in  1958, 1985  and  1997  along  52°W  and  66°W
between  20°N  to  35°N  (Joyce  et  al., 1999)  show  a  rate  of
warming of 0.06°C/decade, similar to that seen at Bermuda but
averaged  over  a  larger  1,700  m  depth  interval.  Trans-Atlantic
sections  along  24°N  in  1957, 1981  and  1992  show  a  similar
warming between 800 and 2,500 m (Parrilla et al., 1994; Bryden
et al., 1996). The maximum warming at 1,100 m is occurring at
a rate of 0.1°C/decade. At 8°N between 1957 and 1993, Arhan et
al.  (1998)  showed  warming  from  1,150  and  2,800  m  with  the
maximum warming of 0.15°C at 1,660 m. 

The Antarctic  bottom  water  in  the Argentine  Basin  of  the
South  Atlantic  experienced  a  marked  cooling  (0.05°C)  and
freshening  (0.008)  during  the  1980s  (Coles  et  al., 1996).  The
bottom waters of the Vema Channel at the northern end of the
Argentine basin did not change significantly during the 1980s but
warmed steadily during a 700-day set of current meter deploy-
ments from 1992 to 1994 (Zenk and Hogg, 1996).

The Indian Ocean
Bindoff and Mcdougall (2000) have examined changes between
historical data collected mostly in the period 1959 to 1966 with
WOCE data collected in 1987 in the southern Indian Ocean at

latitudes 30 to 35°S. They found warming throughout the upper
900 m of the water column (maximum average warming over this
section of 0.5°C at 220 dbar).

2.2.3  Temperature of the Upper Air 

Uncertainties in discerning changes
Several measuring systems are available to estimate the tempera-
ture variations and trends of the air above the surface, though all
contain significant time-varying biases as outlined below.

Weather balloons 
The longest data sets of upper air temperature are derived from
instruments  carried  aloft  by  balloons  (radiosondes).  Changes  in
balloon instrumentation and data processing over the years have
been  pervasive, however, resulting  in  discontinuities  in  these
temperature records (Gaffen, 1994; Parker and Cox, 1995; Parker
et  al., 1997).  Gaffen  et  al.  (2000b)  attempted  to  identify  these
biases  by  using  statistical  tests  to  determine  “change-points” –
sudden temperature shifts not likely to be of natural origin (e.g.,
instrument  changes).  However, they  found  that  alternative
methods  for  identifying  change  points  yield  different  trend
estimates  and  that  the  analysis  was  hampered  by  the  lack  of
complete  documentation  of  instrument  and  data  processing
changes  for  many  stations.  This  study, however, only  analysed
change points in the time-series of individual stations in isolation.
Another technique, used successfully with surface data, relies on
differences produced from comparisons among several stations in
close proximity. In addition, Santer et al. (1999) noted that temper-
ature trends estimated from radiosonde data sets are sensitive to
how temperature shifts are dealt with, which stations are utilised,
and the method used for areal averaging.

Worldwide temperatures from the Microwave Sounding Unit
(MSU)  data  (Christy  et  al., 2000)  have  been  available  from  the
beginning of 1979 for intercomparison studies. Parker et al. (1997)
used  the  lower-stratospheric  and  lower-tropospheric  MSU
products  to  adjust  monthly  radiosonde  reports  for  stations  in
Australia and New Zealand at times when instrumental or data-
processing  changes  were  documented.  Some  individual  strato-
spheric corrections were as much as 3°C due to radiosonde instru-
ment  changes.  The  main  disadvantage  of  the  Parker  et  al.
technique  is  that  the  raw  MSU  record  has  time-varying  biases
which must first be estimated and eliminated (Christy et al., 2000).
Gaffen  et  al.  (2000b)  compared  trends  for  1959  to  1995,
calculated  using  linear  regression, for  twenty-two  stations  with
nearly complete data records at levels between 850 and 30 hPa.
Each of these stations is included in two data sets created since the
SAR: (a)  monthly  mean  temperatures  reported  by  the  weather
balloon  station  operators  (Parker  et  al., 1997;  CLIMAT  TEMP
data) and (b) monthly mean temperatures calculated from archived
daily  weather  balloon  releases  (Eskridge  et  al., 1995;  CARDS
data). Decadal trends at individual sites differed randomly between
the two data sets by typically 0.1°C/decade, with the largest differ-
ences at highest altitudes. In a few cases the differences were larger
and statistically significant at the 1% level. The discrepancies were
sometimes traceable to time-of-observation differences of the data
used to calculate the averages.

120

Observed Climate Variability and Change

The analysis of trends requires long station data records with
minimal missing data. The records for 180 stations in the combined
Global  Climate  Observing  System  Upper Air  Network  (GUAN)
and the Angell (1988, 2000) network do not generally meet this
standard, as only 74 of the GUAN stations, for instance, have at
least  85%  of  tropospheric  monthly  means  available  for  1958  to
1998. In the lower stratosphere (up to 30 hPa), only twenty-two
stations  meet  this  requirement  (Gaffen  et  al., 2000b).  These
deficiencies  present  the  dilemma  of  using  either  relatively  small
networks of stations with adequate data (the Southern Hemisphere,
in  particular, is  poorly  sampled)  or  larger  networks  with  poorer
quality data (adding uncertainty to the resulting trend estimates).

Characteristics, such  as  spatial  coverage, of  each  data  set
derived from the weather balloon data are different. For example,
Sterin (1999) used data from over 800 stations from the CARDS
and  telecommunicated  data  sets, with  only  gross  spatial  and
temporal  consistency  checks. The  data  were  objectively  interpo-
lated  to  all  unobserved  regions, introducing  extra  uncertainty.
Parker et al. (1997) placed CLIMAT TEMP data into 5° latitude ×
10° longitude grid boxes from about 400 sites, leaving unobserved
boxes missing. Further data sets were created employing limited
spatial interpolation and bias-adjustments, but uncertainties related
to  spatial  under-sampling  remain  (Hurrell  et  al., 2000).  Angell
(1988) placed observations from 63 stations into seven broad latitu-
dinal  bands, calculated  the  simple  average  for  each  band  and
produced global, hemispheric and zonal mean anomalies.

Satellites
Radiosondes measure temperatures at discrete levels, but satellite
instruments  observe  the  intensity  of  radiation  from  deep
atmospheric  layers. The  advantage  of  satellites  is  the  essentially
uniform, global, coverage. The three temperature products that are
commonly available from MSU are: the low to mid-troposphere
(MSU  2LT, surface  to  about  8  km), mid-troposphere  (MSU  2,
surface  to  about  18  km, hence  including  some  stratospheric
emissions) and the lower stratosphere (MSU 4, 15 to 23 km, hence
including  some  tropical  tropospheric  emissions)  (Christy  et  al.,
2000).  No  other  data, such  as  from  radiosondes, are  used  to
construct  these  MSU  data  sets.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the
troposphere  and  stratosphere  are  two  distinct  layers  of  the
atmosphere with substantially different temperature variations and
trends.  The  altitude  of  the  troposphere/stratosphere  boundary
varies with latitude, being about 16 to 17 km in the tropics but only
8 to 10 km at high latitudes.

Since the SAR, several issues have emerged regarding MSU
temperatures. Mo (1995) reported that for one of the longest-lived
satellites  (NOAA-12, 1991  to  1998)  the  non-linear  calibration
coefficients  were  erroneous, affecting  MSU  2  and  MSU  2LT.
Wentz  and  Schabel  (1998)  discovered  that  satellite  orbit  decay
introduces gradual, spurious cooling in MSU 2LT. Christy et al.
(1998, 2000) found that instrument responses often differ between
the  laboratory  assessments  and  on-orbit  performance, requiring
further  corrections.  Additional  adjustments  were  also  made  by
recalculating  and  removing  spurious  temperature  trends  due  to
diurnal  effects  induced  by  the  east-west  drift  of  the  spacecraft
(Christy et al., 2000). The magnitude of the spurious trends (1979
to 1998) removed from version D compared to version C were:

orbit  decay, −0.11;  instrument  response, +0.04  and  diurnal  drift,
+0.03°C/decade.

Version D of the MSU data is used in Figure 2.12. The SAR
presented version B that for the low to mid-troposphere indicated
a global trend about 0.05°C/decade more negative than version D
(for  1979  to  1995).  Quite  separately, Prabhakara  et  al.  (1998)
generated a version of MSU 2 without corrections for satellite drift
or instrument body effects, in many ways similar to MSU 2 version
A of Spencer and Christy (1992a, 1992b). 

The Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) detects the intensity
of  thermal  emissions  and  measures  deep  layer  temperatures  at
altitudes  above  20  km  (Nash  and  Forrester, 1986). As  with  the
MSU  products, adjustments  are  required  for  radiometer  biases,
diurnal sampling and orbital drift (Chanin and Ramaswamy, 1999).

Rocketsondes and lidar
Data  sets  generated  from  rocketsondes  have  been  updated
(Golitsyn et al., 1996; Lysenko et al., 1997), providing tempera-
ture information to as high as 75 km. Important difficulties arise
with  these  data  due  to  different  types  of  instrumentation, tidal
cycles  (amplitude  2°C)  and  to  assumed  corrections  for  aerody-
namic heating. The last set of adjustments has the most significant
impact on trends. The approximately 11-year solar cycle forces a
temperature  perturbation  of  >1°C  in  the  mid-  to  upper  strato-
sphere (30 to 50 km). Keckhut et al. (1999) and Dunkerton et al.
(1998)  created  a  quality-controlled  data  set  of  these  measure-
ments, which  is  used  in  Chanin  and  Ramaswamy  (1999).  The
very limited number of launch sites leads to some uncertainty in
deduced temperatures, and most launches were terminated in the
mid-1990s.

Rayleigh  lidar  measurements  began  in  1979  at  the  Haute
Provence  Observatory  in  southern  France  and  have  spread  to
locations around the world. Lidar techniques generate the vertical
profile  of  temperature  from  30  to  90  km, providing  absolute
temperatures  within  2.5°C  accuracy.  Chanin  and  Ramaswamy
(1999) have combined MSU 4, SSU, radiosonde, lidar and rocket-
sonde data to estimate 5-km thick layer temperature variations for
altitudes  of  15  to  50  km, generally  limited  to  the  Northern
Hemisphere mid-latitudes.

Reanalyses
The  principle  of  reanalysis  is  to  use  observations  in  the  data
assimilation scheme of a fixed global weather forecasting model
to create a dynamically consistent set of historical atmospheric
analyses (Kalnay et al., 1996). Within the assimilation scheme,
potentially errant data are amended or excluded using compar-
isons  with  neighbours  and/or  calculated  conditions.  However,
small, time-dependent biases in the observations, of magnitudes
important for climate change, are virtually impossible to detect in
the model, even in areas of adequate in situ data. Furthermore, in
areas with few in situ data the reanalyses are often affected by
inadequate model physics or satellite data for which time-varying
biases have not been removed. 

Though  interannual  variability  is  reproduced  well, known
discontinuities  in  reanalysed  data  sets  indicate  that  further
research  is  required  to  reduce  time-dependent  errors  to  a  level
suitable  for  climate  change  studies  (Basist  and  Chelliah, 1997;

Figure 2.12: (a) Seasonal anomalies of global average temperature (°C), 1958 to 2000, relative to 1979 to 1990 for the lower troposphere, as
observed from satellites (MSU 2LT) and balloons (UKMO 2LT), and for the surface (adapted from Jones et al., 2001). Also shown (bottom graph)
are the differences between the surface temperature anomalies and the averages of the satellite and balloon-based observations of the lower-tropo-
spheric temperature anomalies. (b) As (a) but for the temperature of the lower stratosphere, as observed from satellites (MSU 4 and SSU 15X) and

(bottom graph) are the differences between the MSU 4 and UKMO 4 based temperature anomalies.

Hurrell and Trenberth, 1998; Santer et al., 1999, 2000; Stendel et
al., 2000).  It  is  anticipated  that  future  assessments  of  climate
change  will  utilise  reanalysis  products  to  which  substantial
improvements  will  have  been  made.  Data  from  the  NCEP
reanalysis  are  included  below  for  comparison  purposes, but
longer-term  stratospheric  trends  from  NCEP  are  especially
suspect  due  to  a  large  shift  in  temperature  when  satellite  data
were incorporated for the first time in 1978 (Santer et al., 1999).

2.2.4  How do Surface and Upper Air Temperature Variations 

Compare?

In  Figure  2.12  we  display  the  surface, tropospheric  and  strato-
spheric temperature variations using representative data sets from
those  described  above.  Trend  values  (°C/decade)  are  shown  in

Table 2.3 with 95% confidence intervals, which in part represent
uncertainties due to temporal sampling, not those due to measure-
ment error (see below). The effect of explosive volcanic events
(Agung, 1963;  El  Chichon, 1982;  and  Mt.  Pinatubo, 1991)  is
evident in Figure 2.12, as is a relative shift to warmer tempera-
tures in the lower troposphere compared to the surface in the late
1970s, followed by large variations in both due to ENSO (partic-
ularly  in  1998).  After  the  shift  in  the  late  1970s, the  overall
tropospheric  temperature  trend  is  near  zero  but  the  surface  has
warmed (see Figure 2.12a and Table 2.3).

Global  variations  and  trends  in  the  lower  stratosphere  are
temporally more coherent than in the troposphere (Figure 2.12b),
though  the  warming  effects  due  to  the  volcanic  eruptions  are
clearly evident. For the period 1958 to 2000, all stratospheric data
sets except NCEP 4, which contains erroneous trends, show signif-

are of combined land-surface air temperature (LSAT) and sea surface temperature (SST) or sea ice and sea surface temperature (ISST) anomalies.
The upper air trends are of temperature anomalies corresponding to or approximately corresponding to temperature anomalies from MSU channels
2LT and 4. The tropical region is defined as the latitude band 20°S to 20°N for all the data sets except for the GISS LSAT + UKMO ISST data set
where the region is defined as the latitude band 23.6°S to 23.6°N. The last line of the table shows trends in the differences between temperature
anomalies for the surface, from the UKMO LSAT + UKMO SST data set, and for the lower troposphere, taken as the average of the UKMO 2LT and
MSU 2LT anomalies for 1979 to 2000 and as the UKMO 2LT anomalies alone before 1979. None of the estimates of trends and errors account for
uncertainties in the annual anomalies as these are not available. All calculations use data to the end of 2000 except for those for the NOAA data
sets, which include data up to August 2000 only.

icant negative trends (Table 2.3). Note that MSU 4, and simula-
tions of MSU 4 (UKMO 4 and NCEP 4), include a portion of the
upper troposphere below 100 hPa and so are expected to show less
negative trends than those measuring at higher altitudes (e.g., the
100 to 50 hPa layers in Table 2.3 and the SSU in Figure 2.12b).

Blended information for 5 km thick levels in the strato-
sphere at 45°N compiled by Chanin and Ramaswamy (1999)
show a negative trend in temperature increasing with height:
−0.5°C/decade at 15 km, −0.8°C/decade at 20 to 35 km, and
−2.5°C/decade at 50 km. These large, negative trends are consis-
tent with models of the combined effects of ozone depletion and

increased concentrations of infrared radiating gases, mainly water
vapour and carbon dioxide (Chapters 6 and 12).

The vertical profile of temperature trends based on surface
data and radiosondes is consistent with the satellite temperatures.
Global trends since 1979 are most positive at the surface, though
less  positive  for  night  marine  air  temperatures  in  the  Southern
Hemisphere (see Section 2.2.2.2), near zero for levels between
850 to 300 hPa (1.5 to 8 km) and negative at 200 hPa (11 km) and
above. Thus during the past two decades, the surface, most of the
troposphere, and the stratosphere have responded differently to
climate  forcings  because  different  physical  processes  have

123

dominated in each of these regions during that time (Trenberth et
al., 1992; Christy and McNider, 1994; NRC, 2000 and Chapter
12). On a longer time-scale, the tropospheric temperature trend
since  1958, estimated  from  a  sparser  radiosonde  network, is
closer to that of the surface, about +0.10°C/decade (Figure 2.12a
and Table 2.3) (Angell, 1999, 2000; Brown et al., 2000; Gaffen
et al., 2000a). Gaffen et al. (2000a) and Brown et al. (2000) noted
a  decreasing  lower-tropospheric  lapse  rate  from  1958  to  1980,
and  an  increasing  lower-tropospheric  lapse  rate  after  1980
(Figure 2.12a). However, Folland et al. (1998) showed that global
upper-tropospheric temperature has changed little since the late
1960s because the observed stratospheric cooling extended into
the uppermost regions of the troposphere.

Between 1979 and 2000, the magnitude of trends between the
surface and MSU 2LT is generally most similar in many parts of
the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics (20°N to pole) where deep
vertical  mixing  is  often  a  characteristic  of  the  troposphere.  For
example, the northern extra-tropical trends for the surface and
MSU 2LT were 0.28 and 0.21°C/decade, respectively, and over
the North American continent trends were 0.27 ± 0.24 and 0.28
± 0.23°C/decade, respectively, with an annual correlation of 0.92.
Over Europe the rates were 0.38 ± 0.36 and 0.38 ± 0.30°C/decade,
respectively. Some additional warming of the surface relative to
the lower troposphere would be expected in the winter half year
over extra-tropical Asia (whole year warming rates of 0.35 ± 0.20
and  0.18  ± 0.18°C/decade, respectively), consistent  with  the
vertical temperature structure of the increased positive phase of
the Arctic Oscillation (Thompson et al., 2000a, Figure 2.30). The
vertical  structure  of  the  atmosphere  in  marine  environments,
however, generally  reveals  a  relatively  shallow  inversion  layer
(surface up to 0.7 to 2 km) which is somewhat decoupled from
the  deep  troposphere  above  (Trenberth  et  al., 1992;  Christy,
1995; Hurrell and Trenberth, 1996). Not only are local surface
versus  tropospheric  correlations  often  near  zero  in  these
regions, but  surface  and  tropospheric  trends  can  be  quite
different (Chase et al., 2000). This is seen in the different trends
for the period 1979 to 2000 in the tropical band, 0.10 ± 0.10 and
−0.06 ± 0.16°C/decade, respectively (Table 2.3) and also in the
southern extra-tropics where the trends are 0.08 ± 0.06 and −0.05
± 0.08°C/decade, respectively.  Trends  calculated  for  the  differ-
ences between the surface and the troposphere for 1979 to 2000
are statistically significant globally at 0.13 ± 0.06°C/decade, and
even more so in the tropics at 0.17 ± 0.06°C/decade. Statistical
significance  arises  because  large  interannual  variations  in  the
parent time-series are strongly correlated and so largely disappear
in  the  difference  time-series  (Santer  et  al., 2000;  Christy  et  al.,
2001). However, as implied above, they are not significant over
many extra-tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere such as
North America and Europe and they are also insignificant in some
Southern Hemisphere areas. The sequence of volcanic eruption,
ENSO  events, and  the  trends  in  the Arctic  Oscillation  have  all
been linked to some of this difference in warming rates (Michaels
and  Knappenburg, 2000;  Santer  et  al., 2000;  Thompson  et  al.,
2000a; Wigley, 2000) and do explain a part of the difference in the
rates of warming (see Chapter 12).

The linear trend is a simple measure of the overall tendency
of  a  time-series  and  has  several  types  of  uncertainty;  temporal

sampling uncertainty owing to short data sets, spatial sampling
errors  owing  to  incomplete  spatial  sampling, and  various  other
forms  of  measurement  error, such  as  instrument  or  calibration
errors. Temporal  sampling  uncertainties  are  present  even  when
the data are perfectly known because trends calculated for short
periods  are  unrepresentative  of  other  short  periods, or  of  the
longer term, due to large interannual to decadal variations. Thus
confidence  intervals  for  estimates  of  trend  since  1979  due  to
temporal sampling uncertainty can be relatively large, as high as
± 0.2°C/decade below 300 hPa (Table 2.3, Santer et al., 2000).
Accordingly, the  period  from  1979  to  2000  provides  limited
information  on  long-term  trends, or  trends  for  other  22-year
periods. 

Uncertainties  arising  from  measurement  errors  due  to  the
factors  discussed  in  Section  2.2.3, including  incomplete  spatial
sampling, can be substantial. One estimate of this uncertainty can
be made from comparisons between the various analyses in Table
2.3. For trends below 300 hPa, this uncertainty may be as large as
± 0.10°C/decade since 1979, though Christy et al. (2000) estimate
the 95% confidence interval as ± 0.06°C for the MSU 2LT layer
average.  For  example, Santer  et  al.  (2000)  find  that  when  the
satellite observations from MSU 2LT are masked to match the less
than complete global coverage of the surface observations during
the  past  few  decades, the  differences  in  the  trends  between  the
surface and the troposphere are reduced by about one third.

Summarising, it is very likely that the surface has warmed in
the  global  average  relative  to  the  troposphere, and  the
troposphere has warmed relative to the stratosphere since 1979
(Figure  2.12a,b;  Pielke  et  al., 1998a,b;  Angell, 1999, 2000;
Brown  et  al., 2000;  Christy  et  al., 2000;  Gaffen  et  al., 2000a;
Hurrell et al., 2000; NRC, 2000; Stendel et al., 2000). However,
the relative warming is spatially very variable and most signifi-
cant  in  the  tropics  and  sub-tropics.  There  is  evidence  that  the
troposphere warmed relative to the surface in the pre-satellite era
(1958  to  1979, see  Brown  et  al., 2000;  Gaffen  et  al., 2000a),
though confidence in this finding is lower. Uncertainties due to
limited  temporal  sampling  prevent  confident  extrapolation  of
these trends to other or longer time periods (Christy et al., 2000;
Hurrell  et  al., 2000;  NRC, 2000;  Santer  et  al., 2000).  Some
physical explanations for changes in the vertical profile of global
temperature trends are discussed in Chapter 12 but a full explana-
tion  of  the  lower-tropospheric  lapse  rate  changes  since  1958
requires further research.

2.2.5  Changes in the Cryosphere

This chapter does not describe changes in the major ice sheets as
this is dealt with in detail in Chapter 11. 

2.2.5.1  Snow cover, including snowfall
Satellite  records  indicate  that  the  Northern  Hemisphere  annual
snow-cover extent (SCE) has decreased by about 10% since 1966
largely  due  to  decreases  in  spring  and  summer  since  the  mid-
1980s over both the Eurasian and American continents (Figure

statistically significant change. Reduction in snow cover during
the  mid-  to  late  1980s  was  strongly  related  to  temperature

Figure 2.13: (a) Anomalies of monthly snow cover over the Northern
Hemisphere lands (including Greenland) between November 1966 and
May 2000. Also shown are twelve-month running anomalies of
hemispheric snow extent, plotted on the seventh month of a given
interval. Anomalies are calculated from NOAA/NESDIS snow maps.
Mean hemispheric snow extent is 25.2 million km2 for the full period
of record. the curve of running means is extrapolated by using period
of record monthly means for 12 months in the late 1960s in order to
create a continuous curve of running means. Missing months fell
between May and October, and no winter months are missing. June
1999 to May 2000 values are based on preliminary analyses. (b)
Seasonal snowcover anomalies (in million km2) versus temperature
anomalies (in °C). Both snow and temperature anomalies are area
averages over the region for which climatological values of seasonal
snow-cover frequency (based on the 1973 to 1998 period) are between
10 and 90%. Season is indicated at the top of each panel. Axis for
snow anomaly on the left-hand-side y axis, axis for temperature
anomaly is on the right-hand-side y axis. Bar plot indicates time-series
of snow cover anomalies. Continuous colour curve indicates nine-point
weighted average of snow-cover anomaly. Dashed black curve
indicates time-series of nine-point weighted average of area average
temperature anomaly. Snow-cover calculations are based on the
NOAA/NESDIS snow cover data for the period 1973 to 1998 (updated
from Robinson et al., 1993). Temperature calculations are based on the
Jones data set, hence anomalies are with respect to the time period
1961 to 1990. Snow anomalies are with respect to the time period
1973 to 1998. Correlation coefficient (r) between seasonal snow cover
anomalies and temperature anomalies is indicated in parentheses.

Observed Climate Variability and Change

increases in snow covered areas (Figure 2.13b). There is a highly
significant  interannual  (+0.6)  and  multi-decadal  correlation
between  increases  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  spring  land
temperature and a reduction in the Northern Hemisphere spring
snow  cover  since  data  have  been  available  (1966).  Snow  cover
extent has decreased about 10% since 1966. The improvements in
the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  visible  satellite  imagery  used  to
produce  the  operational  snow-cover  product  cannot  account  for
the observed changes in snow cover.

Longer  regional  time-series  based  on  station  records  and
reconstructions  suggest  that  Northern  Hemisphere  spring  and
summer SCEs in the past decade have been at their lowest values
in the past 100 years. In the other seasons, it is likely that extents
in the latter portion of the 20th century exceeded those of earlier
years (Brown, 2000).

Reconstructions for North America suggest that while there
has been a general decrease in spring SCE since 1915, it is likely
that winter SCE has increased (Brown and Goodison, 1996; Frei
et al., 1999; Hughes and Robinson, 1996; Hughes et al., 1996).
Similar to the results in North America, in Eurasia April SCE has
significantly decreased; but lack of data has prevented an analysis
of winter trends (Brown, 2000). Over Canada, there has been a
general  decrease  in  snow  depth  since  1946, especially  during
spring, in agreement with decreases in SCE (Brown and Braaten,
1998). Winter depths have declined over European Russia since
1900 (Meshcherskaya et al., 1995), but have increased elsewhere
over  Russia  in  the  past  few  decades  (Fallot  et  al., 1997).  The
common thread between studies that have examined seasonality is
an overall reduction in spring snow cover in the latter half of the
20th century.

There  have  been  relatively  few  studies  of  snowfall  trends
across  the  globe.  Statistically  significant  increases  in  seasonal
snowfall  have  been  observed  over  the  central  USA  in  the  20th
century (Hughes and Robinson, 1996). In recent decades, snowfall
has  also  been  heavier  to  the  lee  of  the  North  American  Great
Lakes than earlier in the century (Leathers and Ellis, 1996). These
findings are in line with observations from Canada and the former
Soviet  Union, reflecting  a  trend  towards  increased  precipitation
over  the  mid-latitude  lands  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere
(Groisman and Easterling, 1994; Brown and Goodison, 1996; Ye
et al., 1998). 

2.2.5.2  Sea-ice extent and thickness
Sea-ice extent
Sea-ice  extent  is  expected  to  become  a  sensitive  indicator  of  a
warming  climate, although  only  recently  have  long  records
become  available  in  the Arctic, and  our  knowledge  of Antarctic
sea-ice extent before the 1970s is very limited. 

Sea-ice  extent  (the  area  within  the  ice-ocean  margin)  was
observed  from  space  from  1973  to  1976  using  the  ESMR
(Electrically  Scanning  Microwave  Radiometer)  satellite-based
instrument, and  then  continuously  from  1978  using  the  SSMR
(Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer) (1978 to 1987)
and SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave/Imager) (1987 to present).
By  inter-calibrating  data  from  different  satellites, Bjørgo  et  al.
(1997) and subsequently Cavalieri et al. (1997) obtained uniform
monthly  estimates  of  sea-ice  extent  for  both  hemispheres  from

Fig 2.15: Time-series of annual and seasonal sea-ice extent in the
Northern Hemisphere, 1901 to 1999, (Annual values from Vinnikov et
al., 1999b; seasonal values updated from Chapman and Walsh, 1993.)

November 1978 through to December 1996. Over this period, the
sea-ice extent over the Northern Hemisphere showed a decrease of
−2.8  ± 0.3%/decade  (Parkinson  et  al., 1999), consistent  with
Johannessen et al. (1995) (Figure 2.14). The Arctic decrease was
strongest in the Eastern Hemisphere and most apparent in summer
(Maslanik et al., 1996; Parkinson et al., 1999). 

Hemispheric and regional data sets for the Arctic enable the
satellite-derived trends in Figure 2.14 to be placed into a century
scale context. Figure 2.15 shows annual time-series of the Northern
Hemisphere ice extent by season from 1901 to 1999 using in situ
data before the satellite era (Vinnikov et al., 1999a). It should be
emphasised that the spatial coverage of earlier data is not complete,
with the largest data voids in the autumn and winter. Because few
data were available, the variability of the autumn and wintertime
series  in  Figure  2.15  is  smaller  during  the  early  decades  of  the
century. Essentially no data for summer and autumn are available
for the World War II period. The summer decrease that is largely
responsible for the overall downward trend during the satellite era
is present during the entire second half of the 20th century (Figure
2.15). This decrease represents about 15% of the average summer
extent in the first half of the 20th century. Spring values show a
somewhat weaker negative trend over the same period with a total
reduction  of  near  8%, but  there  is  only  a  slight  and  uncertain
downward trend in autumn and winter since about 1970.

The overall recent decrease of Arctic ice extent is, at first sight,
consistent  with  the  recent  pattern  of  high  latitude  temperature
change, which includes a warming over most of the sub-arctic land
areas (Section 2.2.2.1). Some of this pattern of warming has been
attributed  to  recent  trends  in  the  atmospheric  circulation  of  the
North Atlantic  Oscillation  and  its Arctic-wide  manifestation, the
Arctic Oscillation (Section 2.6). 

Related to the decline in sea-ice extent is a decrease in the
length of the sea-ice season (Parkinson, 2000) and an increase in
the length of the Arctic summer melting season between 1979 and
1998, also  derived  from  satellite  data.  The  shortest  season  was
1979  (57  days)  and  the  longest  was  in  1998  (81  days)  with  an
increasing trend of 5 days per decade (Smith, 1998, updated). The
7% per decade reduction in the multi-year ice area during 1978 to
1998  is  relatively  large  compared  with  an  approximately
2%/decade decrease in the total ice area in winter (Johannessen et
al., 1999). This reflects greater summer melting, consistent with
the results of Smith (1998). 

Over the period 1979 to 1996, the Antarctic (Cavalieri et al.,
1997;  Parkinson  et  al., 1999)  shows  a  weak  increase  of  1.3  ±
0.2%/decade.  Figure  2.16  (for  1973  to  1998)  shows  a  new
integrated data set of Antarctic sea-ice extent that was put together
for  the  new  European  Centre  for  Medium-range  Weather
Forecasts  (ECMWF)  40-year  reanalysis  that  extends  the  record
back to 1973. While showing the same weak increase after 1979,
it  also  suggests  greater  ice  extents  in  the  mid-1970s. Although
century scale time-series cannot be constructed for the Antarctic,
de la Mare (1997) has used whaling ship logs to infer significantly
greater  ice  extent  in  the  Southern  Ocean  during  the  1930s  and
1940s  than  during  recent  decades.  The  indirect  nature  of  the
earlier evidence, however, introduces substantial uncertainty into
this conclusion.

Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves
Although  warming  over Antarctica  as  a  whole  appears  to  have
been perhaps half of a degree in the last half century (Jacka and
Budd, 1998), the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed more rapidly,
by  more  than  2oC  since  the  1940s  (King, 1994). This  regional

Figure 2.16: Monthly Antarctic sea-ice extent anomalies, 1973 to
2000, relative to 1973 to 1996. The data are a blend of National Ice
Center (NIC) chart-derived data (Knight, 1984), Goddard Space
Flight Center satellite passive-microwave (Scanning Multichannel
Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I)) derived data (Cavalieri et al., 1997) and
National Centers for Environmental Prediction satellite passive-
microwave derived data (Grumbine, 1996). It is uncertain as to
whether the decrease in interannual variability of sea ice after about
1988 is real or an observing bias.

warming, whose  cause  has  yet  to  be  fully  discovered  (but  see
Section  2.6.6), has  led  to  a  southerly  migration  of  the  climatic
limit of ice shelves so that five ice shelves have retreated over the
last century (Vaughan and Doake, 1996). The progressive retreat
of  ice  shelves  eventually  resulted  in  the  spectacular  final-stage
collapse of the Prince Gustav and parts of the Larsen ice shelves
in 1995. Each left only a small residual shelf. After the collapse,
James Ross Island, situated off the northern end of the Antarctic
Peninsula, is now circumnavigable by ship for the first time since
it  was  discovered  in  the  early  19th  century  (Vaughan  and
Lachlan-Cope, 1995). 

Sea-ice thickness
Our  knowledge  of  sea-ice  thickness  in  the Arctic  comes  largely
from upward sonar profiling by USA and British submarines since
1958 and 1971, respectively. Rothrock et al. (1999) compared late
summer  September  to  October  data  from  1993, 1996  and  1997
from an USA civilian submarine research  programme with  data
from six summer cruises from the period 1958 to 1976. Thickness
was  adjusted  to  mid-September  values  to  account  for  seasonal
variability.  The  significant  decline  in  mean  ice  thickness  was
observed for all regions, increasing from the Canada Basin towards
Europe  (Figure  2.17).  Overall, there  was  a  mean  reduction  in
thickness of 42% from 3.1 to 1.8 m the earlier period to the present.
Wadhams  and  Davis  (2000)  have  compared  ice  thickness
changes  between  October  1976  and  September  1996  between
81°N and 90°N near the 0° meridian. The overall decline in mean
sea-ice thickness between 1976 and 1996 was 43%. Over every
one degree of latitude, both a significant decline in ice thickness

and some completely open water were observed. Despite these
dramatic  results, it  is  not  known  whether  these  changes  reflect
long-term change or a major mode of multi-decadal variability.
Vinje  et  al.  (1998)  measured  the  thickness  of  ice  exiting  the
Arctic  Ocean  through  Fram  Strait  from  1990  to  1996  using
moored  upward  looking  sonars  and  reported  a  rather  different
result. The mean annual ice thickness in Fram Strait varied from
2.64 to 3.41 m. These observations were consistent with Arctic
Ocean-wide ice thickness estimates made by drilling from Soviet
Ice  Stations  from  1972  to  1981  and  from  submarine  transects
from 1960 to 1982, suggesting little change in ice thickness from
the 1960s and 1970s to the 1990s.

Nagurnyi  et  al.  (1994, 1999)  used  measurements  of  long
surface gravity waves in the Arctic ice pack to estimate the mean
ice  thickness  from  wave  attenuation.  These  measurements  are
available for the winters of 1978/79 to 1990/91. Johannessen et
al.  (1999)  demonstrated  a  strong  correlation  between  these  ice
thickness  estimates  and  the  area  of  multi-year  (MY)  ice  in  the
Arctic Ocean as obtained from the SSMR and SSM/I. Both the
area of MY ice and the ice thickness (winter) estimates show a
decrease of 5 to 7%/decade, considerably less than the submarine

estimates (late summer). Even though the satellite measurements
have continued for more than twenty years, they are inadequate
to  distinguish  between  changes  due  to  long-term  trends  or
interannual/inter-decadal variability (Johannessen et al., 1999).

2.2.5.3  Permafrost
About  25%  of  the  land  mass  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere  is
underlain by permafrost, including large regions of Canada, China,
Russia  and  Alaska, with  smaller  permafrost  areas  in  mountain
chains of many other countries in both the Northern and Southern
Hemisphere (Brown et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999). Permafrost
in  large  part  depends  on  climate.  Over  half  of  the  world’s
permafrost  is  at  temperatures  a  few  degrees  below  0°C.
Temperature  variations  in  near-surface  permafrost  (20  to  200  m
depth) can be used as a sensitive indicator of the inter-annual and
decade-to-century climatic variability and long-term changes in the
surface  energy  balance  (Lachenbruch  and  Marshall, 1986;
Lachenbruch et al., 1988; Clow et al., 1991; Beltrami and Taylor,
1994; Majorowicz and Judge, 1994). Very small changes in surface
climate  can  produce  important  changes  in  permafrost  tempera-
tures. Lachenbruch and Marshall (1986) used climate reconstruc-
tions  from  deep  (>125  m  depth)  temperature  measurements  in
permafrost to show that there has been a general warming of the
permafrost in the Alaskan Arctic of 2 to 4°C over the last century. 
Evidence of change in the southern extent of the discontin-
uous permafrost zone in the last century has also been recorded.
In  North America, the  southern  boundary  of  the  discontinuous
permafrost zone has migrated northward in response to warming
after the Little Ice Age, and continues to do so today (Thie, 1974;
Vitt et al., 1994; Halsey et al., 1995; Laberge and Payette, 1995;
French and Egorov, 1998). In China both an increase in the lower
altitudinal limit of mountain permafrost and a decrease in areal
extent have been observed (Wang et al., 2000).

Long-term  monitoring  of  shallow  permafrost  began  in
earnest  in  the  last  few  decades.  Recent  analyses  indicate  that
permafrost  in  many  regions  of  the  earth  is  currently  warming
(Gravis  et  al., 1988;  Haeberli  et  al., 1993;  Osterkamp, 1994;
Pavlov, 1994; Wang  and  French, 1994;  Ding, 1998;  Sharkhuu,
1998; Vonder  Mühll  et  al., 1998;  Weller  and Anderson, 1998;
Osterkamp  and  Romanovsky, 1999;  Romanovsky  and
Osterkamp, 1999). However, the onset, magnitude (from a few
tenths to a few degrees centigrade) and rate of warming varies
regionally, and not all sites in a given region show the same trend
(Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999). This variability, as well as
short-term  (decadal  or  less)  trends  superimposed  on  long-term
(century)  trends, is  briefly  discussed  in  Serreze  et  al.  (2000).
There has also been evidence of recent permafrost cooling into
the  mid-1990s  in  parts  of  north-eastern  and  north-western
Canada  (Allard  et  al., 1995;  Burn, 1998).  However, there  are
regional data gaps, such as in the central and high Arctic in North
America.  A  new  international  permafrost  thermal  monitoring
network (Burgess et al., 2000) is being developed to help address
these  gaps  and  document  the  spatial  and  temporal  variability
across the globe.

Properties  of  the  surface  and  the  active  layer  (that  having
seasonal freezing and thawing) affect surface heat exchanges in
permafrost  regions.  Other  conditions  remaining  constant, the

thickness  of  the  active  layer  could  be  expected  to  increase  in
response to warming of the climate. A circumpolar network to
monitor  active-layer  thickness  at  representative  locations  was
developed in the 1990s to track long-term trends in active layer
thickness (Nelson and Brown, 1997). Active layer thickness time-
series  are  becoming  available  (Nelson  et  al., 1998;  Nixon  and
Taylor, 1998), and evidence of increasing thaw depths is starting
to be reported (Pavlov, 1998; Wolfe et al., 2000).

2.2.5.4  Mountain glaciers 
The recession of mountain glaciers was used in IPCC (1990) to
provide  qualitative  support  to  the  rise  in  global  temperatures
since the late 19th century. Work on glacier recession has consid-
erable potential to support or qualify the instrumental record of
temperature  change  and  to  cast  further  light  on  regional  or
worldwide temperature changes before the instrumental era. Two
types of data from glaciers contain climatic information: (i) mass
balance  observations  and  (ii)  data  on  the  geometry  of  glaciers,
notably glacier length. More comprehensive information is now
becoming available and worldwide glacier inventories have been
updated  (e.g., IAHS  (ICSI)/UNEP/UNESCO, 1999).  Note  that
changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are discussed
in Chapter 11.

We first discuss mass balance observations. The specific mass
balance  is  defined  as  the  net  annual  gain  or  loss  of  mass  at  the
glacier  surface, per  unit  area  of  the  surface.  The  mass  balance
averaged  over  an  entire  glacier  is  denoted  by  Bm.  Systematic
investigations of glacier mass balance started after 1945, so these
records are shorter than the instrumental climate records normally
available in the vicinity. In contrast to frequently made statements,
Bm is not necessarily a more precise indicator of climate change
than is glacier length. Time-series of Bm do contain year-to-year
variability  reflecting  short-term  fluctuations  in  meteorological
quantities  but  of  concern  on  longer  time-scales  is  the  effect  of
changing  glacier  geometry. A  steadily  retreating  glacier  will  get
thinner and the mass balance will become more negative because
of a slowly increasing surface air temperature due to a lowering
surface  that  is  not  reflected  in  a  large-scale  temperature  signal.
Climatic interpretation of long-term trends in of mass balance data
requires  the  use  of  coupled  mass  balance-ice  flow  models  to
separate the climatic and geometric parts of the signal. Such studies
have  only  just  begun.  However, mass  balance  observations  are
needed for estimating the contribution of glacier melt to sea level
rise, so are discussed further in Chapter 11.

A  wealth  of  information  exists  on  the  geometry  of  valley
glaciers. Glacier records are very useful for studies of Holocene
climate variability (e.g., Haeberli et al., 1998; and Section 2.4).
Written  documents  going  back  to  the  16th  century  exist  that
describe  catastrophic  floods  caused  by  the  bursting  of  glacier-
dammed lakes or arable land and farms destroyed by advancing
glaciers, e.g., in 18th century Norway (Østrem et al., 1977). A
large amount of information is available from sketches, etchings,
paintings and old photographs of glaciers, though many show the
same  glaciers  (Holzhauser  and  Zumbühl, 1996).  About  fifty
glaciers have two or more useful pictures from distinctly different
times.  In  many  cases  geomorphologic  evidence  in  the  form  of
terminal moraines and trimlines can be used as reliable comple-

128

mentary information to construct the history of a glacier over the
last  few  centuries.  Systematic  mapping  of  glaciers  started  only
100 years ago and has been limited to a few glaciers. The most
comprehensive  data  are  of  length  variations.  Glacier  length
records  complement  the  instrumental  meteorological  record
because (i) some extend further back in time; (ii) some records
are from remote regions where few meteorological observations
exist;  (iii)  on  average, glaciers  exist  at  a  significantly  higher
altitude than meteorological stations.

The  last  point  is  of  particular  interest  in  the  light  of  the
discrepancy between recent tropical glacier length reduction and
lack of warming in the lower troposphere since 1979 indicated by
satellites  and  radiosondes  in  the  tropics  (Section  2.2.3).  Long-
term  monitoring  of  glacier  extent  provides  abundant  evidence
that  tropical  glaciers  are  receding  at  an  increasing  rate  in  all
tropical  mountain  areas.  This  applies  to  the  tropical  Andes
(Brecher  and  Thompson, 1993;  Hastenrath  and  Ames, 1995;
Ames, 1998), Mount  Kenya  and  Kilimanjaro  (Hastenrath  and
Kruss, 1992; Hastenrath and Greischar, 1997) and to the glaciers
in Irian Jaya (Peterson and Peterson, 1994).

Relating  mass  balance  fluctuations  to  meteorological
conditions is more complicated for tropical glaciers than for mid-
and high latitude glaciers, and it has not been demonstrated that
temperature is the most important factor. Nevertheless, the fast
glacier recession in the tropics seems at first sight to be consistent
with an increase in tropical freezing heights of 100 m over the
period  1970  to  1986  as  reported  by  Diaz  and  Graham  (1996),
corresponding to an increase of 0.5°C at tropical high mountain
levels, which they also link to increases in tropical SST since the
mid-1970s (Figure 2.10). However, although Gaffen et al. (2000)
found a similar increase over 1960 to 1997, they found a lowering
of freezing level over 1979 to 1997 which, at least superficially,
is not consistent with glacier recession.

Figure 2.18 shows a representative selection of glacier length
records from different parts of the world and updates the diagram
in IPCC (1990). It is clear from Figure 2.18 that glacier retreat on
the century time-scale is worldwide. The available data suggest that
this retreat generally started later at high latitudes but in low and
mid-latitudes the retreat generally started in the mid-19th century.
On the global scale, air temperature is considered by most
glaciologists  to  be  the  most  important  factor  reflecting  glacier
retreat. This is based on calculations with mass balance models
(Greuell and Oerlemans, 1987; Oerlemans, 1992; Fleming et al.,
1997;  Jóhannesson, 1997).  For  a  typical  mid-latitude  glacier, a
30% decrease in cloudiness or a 25% decrease in precipitation
would  have  the  same  effect  as  a  1°C  temperature  rise.  Such
changes in cloudiness or precipitation can occur locally or even
regionally  on  a  decadal  time-scale  associated  with  changes  in
circulation, but global trends of this size on a century time-scale
are very unlikely. As mentioned in the SAR, Oerlemans (1994)
concluded that a warming rate of 0.66 ± 0.20°C per century at the
mean glacier altitude could explain the linear part of the observed
retreat of 48 widely distributed glaciers.

Glaciers are generally not in equilibrium with the prevailing
climatic conditions and a more refined analysis should deal with
the different response times of glaciers which involves modelling
(Oerlemans et al., 1998). It will take some time before a large

number of glaciers are modelled. Nevertheless, work done so far
indicates  that  the  response  times  of  glacier  lengths  shown  in
Figure 2.18 are in the 10 to 70 year range. Therefore the timing
of  the  onset  of  glacier  retreat  implies  that  a  significant  global
warming  is  likely  to  have  started  not  later  than  the  mid-19th
century. This  conflicts  with  the  Jones  et  al.  (2001)  global  land
instrumental  temperature  data  (Figure  2.1), and  the  combined
hemispheric and global land and marine data (Figure 2.7), where
clear warming is not seen until the beginning of the 20th century.
This  conclusion  also  conflicts  with  some  (but  not  all)  of  the
palaeo-temperature reconstructions in Figure 2.21, Section 2.3 ,
where  clear  warming, e.g., in  the  Mann  et  al.  (1999)  Northern
Hemisphere series, starts at about the same time as in the Jones
et al. (2001) data. These discrepancies are currently unexplained. 
For the last two to three decades, far more records have been
available than are shown in Figure 2.18. Many are documented at
the  World  Glacier  Monitoring  Service  in  Zürich, Switzerland
(e.g., IAHS (ICSI)/UNEP/UNESCO, 1998) The general picture
is one of widespread retreat, notably in Alaska, Franz-Josef Land,
Asia, the  Alps, Indonesia  and  Africa, and  tropical  and  sub-
tropical regions of South America. In a few regions a consider-
able  number  of  glaciers  are  currently  advancing  (e.g., Western
Norway, New Zealand). In Norway this is very likely to be due to
increases in precipitation owing to the positive phase of the North
Atlantic  Oscillation  (Section  2.6), and  in  the  Southern Alps  of
New  Zealandand  due  to  wetter  conditions  with  little  warming
since about 1980. Finally, indications in the European Alps that
current glacier recession is reaching levels not seen for perhaps a
few  thousand  years  comes  from  the  exposure  of  radiocarbon-
dated  ancient  remains  in  high  glacial  saddles.  Here  there  is  no
significant ice flow and melting is assumed to have taken place in
situ for the first time in millennia (e.g., the finding of the 5,000-
year-old Oetzal “ice man”). 

2.2.5.5  Lake and river ice
Numerous studies suggest the importance of lake and river ice
break-up as an index of climate variability and change, especially
as  related  to  temperature  and  snow  cover  (Palecki  and  Barry,
1986; Schindler et al., 1990; Robertson et al., 1992; Assel and
Robertson, 1995;  Anderson  et  al., 1996;  Wynne  et  al., 1998;
Magnuson et al., 2000). Records of lake and river ice can be used
to independently evaluate changes of temperature and, to some
extent, snow  cover.  Like  other  proxy  measurements  they  have
limitations, and  are  subject  to  their  own  time-dependent  biases
such as changes in observers and protocols related to the identi-
fication of “ice on” and “ice off” conditions. Larger lakes often
have  the  best  records, but  are  often  located  near  human  settle-
ments  which  can  affect  the  homogeneity  of  the  record, e.g.,
associated  cooling  water  discharges  and  urban  heat  islands, so
care is needed to select suitable lakes.

A recent analysis has been made of trends in 39 extensive
Northern Hemisphere lake and river ice records over the 150-year
period  from  1846  to  1995.  Ice  break-up  dates  now  occur  on
average about nine days earlier in the spring than at the beginning
of the record, and autumn freeze-up occurs on average about ten
days later (Magnuson et al., 2000). Only one of the 39 records, in
Japan, showed changes that indicate a slight cooling.

2.2.6  Are the Retreat of Glaciers, Sea Ice, and Snow Cover
Consistent with the Surface Temperature Trends?

A  significant  relationship  has  been  found  between  interannual
variations  (correlation  =  −0.60)  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere
snow-cover  extent  and  land-surface  air  temperature  in  spring
since the 1960s. However, the observed increase in temperature
during the winter is not reflected in a reduced snow-cover extent.
Reduced ice cover on the Northern Hemisphere lakes and rivers,
primarily  due  to  earlier  onset  in  spring  of  ice-free  conditions
during the 20th century, is consistent with reduced snow cover
extent  in  that  season.  Sea-ice  retreat  in  the  Arctic  spring  and
summer  is  also  consistent  with  an  increase  in  spring, and  to  a
lesser extent, summer temperatures in the high northern latitudes.
Summer temperature increases have been less than in spring in
nearby  land  areas, but  Arctic  sea-ice  extent  and  especially
thickness have markedly decreased. Nevertheless, there is only a
small  indication  of  reduced Arctic  sea  ice  during  winter  when
temperatures have also increased. Antarctic sea-ice extent has not
decreased since the late 1970s, possibly related to recent indica-
tions of little change in Antarctic temperatures over much of the
continent in that period . There is now ample evidence to support
a  major  retreat  of  most  mountain  glaciers  during  the  last  100
years in response to widespread increases in temperature. There
has been especially fast glacial recession in the tropics in recent
decades, although  tropical  temperatures  in  the  free  atmosphere
near glacier levels have increased little since 1980 according to
radiosonde and MSU data. 

2.2.7  Summary 

Global surface temperatures have increased between 0.4 and 0.8°C
since the late 19th century, but most of this increase has occurred
in two distinct periods, 1910 to 1945 and since 1976. The rate of
temperature increase since 1976 has been over 0.15°C/decade. Our
confidence in the rate of warming has increased since the SAR due
to new analyses including: model simulations using observed SSTs
with  and  without  corrections  for  time-dependent  biases, new
studies  of  the  effect  of  urbanisation  on  global  land  temperature
trends, new  evidence  for  mass  ablation  of  glaciers, continued
reductions  in  snow-cover  extent, and  a  significant  reduction  in
Arctic  sea-ice  extent  in  spring  and  summer, and  in  thickness.
However, there is some disagreement between warming rates in the
various  land  and  ocean-based  data  sets  in  the  1990s, though  all
agree on appreciable warming.

New analyses of mean daily maximum and minimum temper-
atures continue to support a reduction in the diurnal temperature
range  with  minimum  temperatures  increasing  at  about  twice  the
rate  of  maximum  temperatures  over  the  second  half  of  the  20th
century. Seasonally, the greatest warming since 1976 over land has
occurred during the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring, but
significant warming has also occurred in the Northern Hemisphere
summer. Southern Hemisphere warming has also been strongest
during  the  winter  over  land, but  little  difference  between  the
seasons is apparent when both land and oceans are considered. The
largest rates of warming continue to be found in the mid- and high
latitude continental regions of the Northern Hemisphere. 

130

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Analyses  of  overall  temperature  trends  in  the  low  to  mid-
troposphere  and  near  the  surface  since  1958  are  in  good
agreement, with a warming of about 0.1°C per decade. Since the
beginning  of  the  satellite  record  (1979), however, low  to  mid-
troposphere  temperatures  have  warmed  in  both  satellite  and
weather  balloon  records  at  a  global  rate  of  only  0.04  and
0.03°C/decade  respectively.  This  is  about  0.12°C/decade  less
than the rate of temperature increase near the surface since 1979.
About half of this difference in warming rate is very likely to be
due to the combination of differences in spatial coverage and the
real physical affects of volcanoes and ENSO (Santer et al., 2000),
see  also  Chapter  12.  The  remaining  difference  remains
unexplained, but  is  likely  to  be  real.  In  the  stratosphere, both
satellites  and  weather  balloons  continue  to  show  substantial
cooling. The faster rate of recession of tropical mountain glaciers
in the last twenty years than might have been expected from the
MSU and radiosonde records remains unexplained, though some
glaciers  may  still  be  responding  to  the  warming  indicated  by
radiosondes that occurred around 1976 to 1981.

2.3  Is the Recent Warming Unusual?

2.3.1  Background 

To  determine  whether  20th  century  warming  is  unusual, it  is
essential  to  place  it  in  the  context  of  longer-term  climate
variability.  Owing  to  the  sparseness  of  instrumental  climate
records prior to the 20th century (especially prior to the mid-19th
century), estimates  of  global  climate  variability  during  past
centuries  must  often  rely  upon  indirect  “proxy’’ indicators −
natural or human documentary archives that record past climate
variations, but must be calibrated against instrumental data for a
meaningful  climate  interpretation  (Bradley, 1999, gives  a
review). Coarsely resolved climate trends over several centuries
are evident in many regions e.g., from the recession of glaciers
(Grove and Switsur, 1994; and Section 2.2.5.4) or the geothermal
information provided by borehole measurements (Pollack et al.,
1998).  Large-scale  estimates  of  decadal, annual  or  seasonal
climate  variations  in  past  centuries, however, must  rely  upon
sources that resolve annual or seasonal climatic variations. Such
proxy  information  includes  width  and  density  measurements
from tree rings (e.g., Cook, 1995; see Fritts, 1991, for a review),
layer thickness from laminated sediment cores (e.g., Hughen et
al., 1996;  Lamoureux  and  Bradley, 1996), isotopes, chemistry,
and  accumulation  from  annually  resolved  ice  cores  (e.g.,
Claussen et al., 1995; Fisher et al., 1998), isotopes from corals
(e.g., Tudhope  et  al., 1995;  Dunbar  and  Cole, 1999), and  the
sparse historical documentary evidence available over the globe
during the past few centuries (see e.g., Bradley and Jones, 1995;
Pfister et al., 1998). Taken as a whole, such proxy climate data
can provide global scale sampling of climate variations several
centuries into the past, with the potential to resolve large-scale
patterns of climate change prior to the instrumental period, albeit
with important limitations and uncertainties.

The SAR examined evidence for climate change in the past,
on  time-scales  of  centuries  to  millennia.  Based  on  information
from  a  variety  of  proxy  climate  indicators, reconstructions  of

mountain  glacier  mass  and  extent, and  geothermal  sub-surface
information from boreholes, it was concluded that summer temper-
atures in the Northern Hemisphere during recent decades are the
warmest in at least six centuries. While data prior to AD 1400 were
considered too sparse for reliable inferences regarding hemispheric
or global mean temperatures, regional inferences were nonetheless
made about climate changes further back in time. 

Since the SAR, a number of studies based on considerably
expanded databases of palaeoclimate information have allowed
more decisive conclusions about the spatial and temporal patterns
of  climate  change  in  past  centuries.  A  number  of  important
advances have been in key areas such as ice core palaeoclima-
tology (e.g., White et al., 1998a), dendroclimatology (e.g., Cook,
1995; Briffa  et  al., 1998b), and geothermal palaeo-temperature
estimation (e.g., Pollack et al., 1998). Moreover, the latest studies
based  on  global  networks  of  “multi-proxy” data  have  proved
particularly useful for describing global or hemispheric patterns
of climate variability in past centuries (e.g., Bradley and Jones,
1993; Hughes and Diaz, 1994; Mann et al., 1995; Fisher, 1997;
Overpeck et al., 1997; Mann et al., 1998, 1999). Such estimates
allow  the  observed  trends  of  the  20th century  to  be  put  in  a
longer-term perspective. These have also allowed better compar-
isons with possible physical influences on climate forcings (Lean
et  al., 1995;  Crowley  and  Kim, 1996, 1999;  Overpeck  et  al.,
1997; Mann et al., 1998; Waple et al., 2001), and for new evalua-
tions  of  the  low-frequency  climate  variability  exhibited  by
numerical climate models (Barnett et al., 1996; Jones et al., 1998;
Crowley and Kim, 1999; Delworth and Mann, 2000).

2.3.2  Temperature of the Past 1,000 Years

The past 1,000 years are a particularly important time-frame for
assessing  the  background  natural  variability  of  the  climate  for
climate  change  detection.  Astronomical  boundary  conditions
have strayed relatively little from their modern-day values over
this interval (but see Section 2.3.4 for a possible caveat) and, with
the  latest  evidence, the  spatial  extent  of  large-scale  climate
change  during  the  past  millennium  can  now  be  meaningfully
characterised (Briffa et al., 1998b; Jones et al., 1998; Mann et al.,
1998; 1999; 2000a; 2000b). Moreover, estimates of volcanic and
solar climate forcings are also possible over this period, allowing
model-based  estimates  of  their  climate  effects  (Crowley  and
Kim, 1999; Free and Robock, 1999).

2.3.2.1  Palaeoclimate proxy indicators
A “proxy” climate indicator is a local record that is interpreted
using  physical  or  biophysical  principles  to  represent  some
combination  of  climate-related  variations  back  in  time.
Palaeoclimate  proxy  indicators  have  the  potential  to  provide
evidence for large-scale climatic changes prior to the existence of
widespread  instrumental  or  historical  documentary  records.
Typically, the interpretation of a proxy climate record is compli-
cated by the presence of “noise” in which climate information is
immersed, and a variety of possible distortions of the underlying
climate information (e.g., Bradley, 1999; Ren, 1999a,b). Careful
calibration  and  cross-validation  procedures  are  necessary  to
establish a reliable relationship between a proxy indicator and the

Observed Climate Variability and Change

131

climatic variable or variables it is assumed to represent, providing
a “transfer” function through which past climatic conditions can
be estimated. High-resolution proxy climate indicators, including
tree rings, corals, ice cores, and laminated lake/ocean sediments,
can be used to provide detailed information on annual or near-
annual climate variations back in time. Certain coarser resolution
proxy  information  (from  e.g., boreholes, glacial  moraines, and
non-laminated ocean sediment records) can usefully supplement
this  high-resolution  information.  Important  recent  advances  in
the  development  and  interpretation  of  proxy  climate  indicators
are described below.

Tree rings
Tree-ring  records  of  past  climate  are  precisely  dated, annually
resolved, and  can  be  well  calibrated  and  verified  (Fritts, 1976).
They  typically  extend  from  the  present  to  several  centuries  or
more  into  the  past, and  so  are  useful  for  documenting  climate
change  in  terrestrial  regions  of  the  globe.  Many  recent  studies
have sought to reconstruct warm-season and annual temperatures
several centuries or more ago from either the width or the density
of annual growth rings (Briffa et al., 1995; D’Arrigo et al., 1996;
Jacoby  et  al., 1996;  D’Arrigo  et  al., 1998;  Wiles  et  al., 1998;
Hughes et al., 1999; Cook et al., 2000). Recently, there has been
a  concerted  effort  to  develop  spatial  reconstructions  of  past
temperature variations (e.g., Briffa et al., 1996) and estimates of
hemispheric  and  global  temperature  change  (e.g., Briffa  et  al.,
1998b; Briffa, 2000). Tree-ring networks are also now being used
to reconstruct important indices of climate variability over several
centuries  such  as  the  Southern  Oscillation  Index  (Stahle  et  al.,
1998), the North Atlantic Oscillation (Cook et al., 1998; Cullen et
al., 2001)  and  the  Antarctic  Oscillation  Index  (Villalba  et  al.,
1997)  (see  also  Section  2.6), as  well  as  patterns  of  pre-instru-
mental precipitation and drought (Section 2.5.2.2).

Several important caveats must be borne in mind when using
tree-ring data for palaeoclimate reconstructions. Not least is the
intrinsic sampling bias. Tree-ring information is available only in
terrestrial regions, so is not available over substantial regions of
the globe, and the climate signals contained in tree-ring density or
width  data  reflect  a  complex  biological  response  to  climate
forcing.  Non-climatic  growth  trends  must  be  removed  from  the
tree-ring  chronology, making  it  difficult  to  resolve  time-scales
longer  than  the  lengths  of  the  constituent  chronologies  (Briffa,
2000).  Furthermore, the  biological  response  to  climate  forcing
may change over time. There is evidence, for example, that high
latitude tree-ring density variations have changed in their response
to  temperature  in  recent  decades, associated  with  possible  non-
climatic factors (Briffa et al., 1998a). By contrast, Vaganov et al.
(1999) have presented evidence that such changes may actually be
climatic and result from the effects of increasing winter precipita-
tion  on  the  starting  date  of  the  growing  season  (see  Section
2.7.2.2). Carbon dioxide fertilization may also have an influence,
particularly  on  high-elevation  drought-sensitive  tree  species,
although attempts have been made to correct for this effect where
appropriate  (Mann  et  al., 1999).  Thus  climate  reconstructions
based entirely on tree-ring data are susceptible to several sources
of  contamination  or  non-stationarity  of  response.  For  these
reasons, investigators have increasingly found tree-ring data most

useful when supplemented by other types of proxy information in
“multi-proxy” estimates of past temperature change (Overpeck et
al., 1997;  Jones  et  al., 1998;  Mann  et  al., 1998;  1999;  2000a;
2000b; Crowley and Lowery, 2000).

Corals
Palaeoclimate  reconstructions  from  corals  provide  insights  into
the  past  variability  of  the  tropical  and  sub-tropical  oceans  and
atmosphere, prior to the instrumental period, at annual or seasonal
resolutions, making them a key addition to terrestrial information.
Because of their potential to sample climate variations in ENSO-
sensitive  regions, a  modest  network  of  high-quality  coral  site
records can resolve key large-scale patterns of climate variability
(Evans et al., 1998). The corals used for palaeoclimate reconstruc-
tion grow throughout the tropics in relatively shallow waters, often
living  for  several  centuries.  Accurate  annual  age  estimates  are
possible for most sites using a combination of annual variations in
skeletal  density  and  geochemical  parameters.  Palaeoclimate
reconstructions from corals generally rely on geochemical charac-
teristics of the coral skeleton such as temporal variations in trace
elements  or  stable  isotopes  or, less  frequently, on  density  or
variations in fluorescence. Dunbar and Cole (1999) review the use
of coral records for palaeoclimatic reconstruction. 

Ice cores
Ice cores from polar regions of northern Greenland, Canada and
the islands of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, Antarctica,
and  alpine, tropical  and  sub-tropical  locations  (e.g., Thompson,
1996)  can  provide  several  climate-related  indicators.  These
indicators  include  stable  isotopes  (e.g., 18O), the  fraction  of
melting ice, the rate of accumulation of precipitation, concentra-
tions of various salts and acids, the implied atmospheric loading
of dust pollen, and trace gases such as CH4 and CO2.

Recently, there has been increased activity in creating high-
resolution Antarctic ice core series e.g., for the past millennium
(Peel  et  al., 1996;  Mayewski  and  Goodwin, 1997;  Morgan  and
van Ommen, 1997). In certain regions, isotope information from
ice cores shows the late 20th century temperatures as the warmest
few decades in the last 1,000 years (Thompson et al., 2000a). Key
strengths of ice core information are their high resolution (annual
or even seasonal where accumulations rates are particularly high
− see van Ommen and Morgan, 1996, 1997), availability in polar
and  high-elevation  regions  where  other  types  of  proxy  climate
information  like  tree-ring  data  are  not  available, and  their
provision  of  multiple  climate-  and  atmosphere-related  variables
from the same reasonably well dated physical location (e.g., the
GISP2 core; White et al., 1998a). A weakness of ice core data is
regional sampling bias (high elevation or high latitude) and melt
water  and  precipitation  accumulation  data  are  not  easy  to  date
accurately.

The  best  dated  series  are  based  on  sub-annual  sampling  of
cores  and  the  counting  of  seasonal  ice  layers.  Such  series  may
have absolute dating errors as small as a few years in a millennium
(Fisher  et  al., 1996).  Dating  is  sometimes  performed  using
volcanic  acid  layers  with  assumed  dates  (e.g., Clausen  et  al.,
1995) but uncertainties in the volcanic dates can result in dating
uncertainties throughout the core (Fisher et al., 1998).

132

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Lake and ocean sediments
Annually  laminated  (varved)  lake  sediments  offer  considerable
potential  as  high-resolution  archives  of  palaeo-environmental
conditions where other high-resolution proxy indicators are not
available (e.g., arid terrestrial regions), and latitudes poleward of
the  treeline  (Lamoureux  and  Bradley, 1996;  Wohlfarth  et  al.,
1998; Hughen et al., 2000). When annual deposition of the varves
can  be  independently  confirmed  (e.g., through  radiometric
dating), they  provide  seasonal  to  interannual  resolution  over
centuries  to  millennia.  Varved  sediments  can  be  formed  from
biological  processes  or  from  the  deposition  of  inorganic
sediments, both  of  which  are  often  influenced  by  climate
variations. Three  primary  climate  variables  may  influence  lake
varves: (a)  summer  temperature, serving  as  an  index  of  the
energy available to melt the seasonal snowpack, or snow and ice
on  glaciers;  (b)  winter  snowfall, which  governs  the  volume  of
discharge capable of mobilising sediments when melting; and (c)
rainfall. Laminated lake sediments dominated by (a) can be used
for  inferences  about  past  high  latitude  summer  temperature
changes (e.g., Overpeck et al., 1997), while sediments dominated
by the latter two influences can be used to estimate past drought
and precipitation patterns (Section 2.5.2.2).

Ocean  sediments  may  also  be  useful  for  high-resolution
climate  reconstructions.  In  rare  examples, annually  laminated
sediments can be found (e.g., Hughen et al., 1996; Black et al.,
1999) and it is possible to incorporate isotope and other informa-
tion in climate reconstructions, much as varved lake sediments
are used. Otherwise, sedimentation rates may sometimes still be
sufficiently high that century-scale variability is resolvable (e.g.,
the  Bermuda  rise  ocean  sediment  oxygen  isotope  record  of
Keigwin, 1996).  Dating  in  such  cases, however, must  rely  on
radiometric methods with relatively poor age control. 

Borehole measurements
Borehole measurements attempt to relate profiles of temperature
with  depth  to  the  history  of  temperature  change  at  the  ground
surface. The present global database of more than 600 borehole
temperature-depth profiles has the densest geographic coverage
in North America and Europe, but sparser data are available in
other regions (e.g., Australia, Asia, Africa and South America).
The depths of the temperature profiles range from about 200 to
greater  than  1,000  m, allowing  palaeo-temperature  reconstruc-
tions back several hundred to a thousand years. Although large-
scale temperature reconstructions have been made to more than a
millennium  ago  (Huang  et  al., 1997), they  show  substantial
sensitivity to assumptions that are needed to convert the temper-
ature profiles to ground surface temperature changes. Borehole
data are probably most useful for climate reconstructions over the
last five centuries (Pollack et al., 1998). 

Figure  2.19  shows  a  reconstructed  global  ground  surface
temperature history (Pollack et al., 1998; see also Huang et al.,
2000) from an average of the 358 individual sites, most located
in North America and Eurasia, but some located in Africa, South
America and Australia (similar results are obtained by Huang et
al., 2000, using an updated network of 616 sites). Superimposed
is  an  instrumental  estimate  of  global  surface  air  temperature
(Jones and Briffa, 1992). The ensemble of reconstructions shows

that the average ground temperature of the Earth has increased by
about  0.5°C  during  the  20th  century, and  that  this  was  the
warmest of the past five centuries. About 80% of the sites experi-
enced  a  net  warming  over  this  period.  The  estimated  mean
cumulative  ground  surface  temperature  change  since  1500  is
close to 1.0 ± 0.3°C. Uncertainties due to spatial sampling (see
Pollack et al., 1998 and Huang et al., 2000) are also shown. It
should  be  noted  that  the  temporal  resolution  of  the  borehole
estimates decreases sharply back in time, making it perilous to
compare the shape of the trend shown in Figure 2.19 with better-
resolved trends determined from higher-resolution climate proxy
data discussed below.

While  borehole  data  provide  a  direct  estimate  of  ground
surface  temperatures  under  certain  simplifying  assumptions
about the geothermal properties of the earth near the borehole, a
number of factors complicate their interpretation. Non-tempera-
ture-related factors such as land-use changes, natural land cover
variations, long-term  variations  in  winter  snow  cover  and  soil
moisture change the sub-surface thermal properties and weaken
the interpretation of the reconstructions as estimates of surface air
temperature  change.  In  central  England, where  seasonal  snow
cover  is  not  significant, and  major  land-use  changes  occurred
many centuries ago, borehole ground surface temperature trends
do tend to be similar to those in long instrumental records (Jones,
1999).  In  contrast, Skinner  and  Majorowicz  (1999)  show  that
borehole  estimates  of  ground  surface  temperature  warming
during the 20th century in north-western North America are 1 to
2°C  greater  than  in  corresponding  instrumental  estimates  of
surface air temperature. They suggest that this discrepancy may
be  due  to  land-use  changes  that  can  enhance  warming  of  the
ground  surface  relative  to  that  of  the  overlying  atmospheric
boundary layer (see also Lewis, 1998). Such factors need to be
better understood before borehole temperature measurements can
be confidently interpreted.

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Documentary evidence

Historical  documentary  data  are  valuable  sources  of
information  about  past  climate  (e.g., Brown  and  Issar, 1998;
Bradley, 1999). However, their use requires great care, as such
documents  may  be  biased  towards  describing  only  the  more
extreme  events, and  are, in  certain  cases, prone  to  the  use  of
inconsistent  language  between  different  writers  and  different
epochs, and  to  errors  in  dating.  As  for  all  proxy  information,
historical documents require careful calibration and verification
against modern instrumental data. Two areas particularly strong
in historical documents describing climate are Europe and China.
In Europe, attempts have been made to extend long climate series
back in time using a combination of documentary evidence and
fragmentary  instrumental  records  (e.g., Pfister, 1995;  Pfister  et
al., 1998). Additional information about past climate change has
also been obtained purely from documentary records in Europe
(e.g., Martin-Vide and Barriendos, 1995; Brázdil, 1996; Pfister et
al., 1996, 1998, 1999; Pfister and Brázdil, 1999; Rodrigo et al.,
1999).  In  China, regional  instrumental  temperature  series  have
been  extended  back  over  much  of  the  past  millennium  using
documentary data combined with inferences from ice cores and
tree rings (Wang et al., 1998a, 1998b; Wang and Gong, 2000).

Mountain glacier moraines
The position of moraines or till left behind by receding glaciers
can provide information on the advances (and, less accurately, the
retreats)  of  mountain  glaciers.  Owing  to  the  complex  balance
between local changes in melting and ice accumulation, and the
effects  of  topography  which  influence  mountain  glaciers  (see
Section 2.2.5.4), it is difficult to reconstruct regional (as opposed
to global) climate changes from the extent of mountain glaciers
alone  (Oerlemans, 1989).  For  example, both  increased  winter
precipitation (through greater accumulation) and lower summer
temperatures (through decreased melting or “ablation”) can lead
to  more  positive  glacial  mass  balances.  The  inertia  of  large
glaciers  dictates  that  they  respond  to  climate  change  relatively
slowly, with  delays  of  decades  or  occasionally  centuries.  For
smaller, fast moving glaciers in regions where precipitation and
accumulation are moderate, temperature changes are usually the
dominant  factor  influencing  mountain  glacier  masses  and
lengths. Here glacier moraine evidence in combination with other
lines  of  evidence  can  provide  reliable  information  on  past
regional  temperature  changes  (Salinger, 1995;  Holzhauser  and
Zumbühl, 1996; Raper et al., 1996; Salinger et al., 1996). 

2.3.2.2  Multi-proxy synthesis of recent temperature change 
Since  the  SAR  there  have  been  several  attempts  to  combine
various types of high-resolution proxy climate indicators to create
large-scale  palaeoclimate  reconstructions  that  build  on  earlier
work by e.g., Bradley and Jones (1993); Hughes and Diaz (1994)
and Mann et al. (1995). Overpeck et al. (1997) and Fisher (1997)
have sought to combine information from ice cores, varved lake
sediment cores, and tree rings to reconstruct high latitude climate
trends  for  past  centuries.  Jones  et  al. (1998)  estimated  extra-
tropical Northern and Southern Hemisphere warm-season temper-
ature  changes  during  the  past  millennium  using  a  sparse  set  of
extra-tropical warm-season temperature proxy indicators (10 and

8 respectively). Mann et al. (1998) reconstructed global patterns
of annual surface temperature several centuries back in time. They
calibrated a combined terrestrial (tree ring, ice core and historical
documentary  indicator)  and  marine  (coral)  multi-proxy  climate
network against dominant patterns of 20th century global surface
temperature.  Averaging  the  reconstructed  temperature  patterns
over  the  far  more  data-rich  Northern  Hemisphere  half  of  the
global  domain, they  estimated  the  Northern  Hemisphere  mean
temperature back to AD 1400, a reconstruction which had signif-
icant  skill  in  independent  cross-validation  tests.  Self-consistent
estimates were also made of the uncertainties. This work has now
been extended back to AD 1000 (Figure 2.20, based on Mann et
al., 1999). The  uncertainties  (the  shaded  region  in  Figure  2.20)
expand  considerably  in  earlier  centuries  because  of  the  sparse
network  of  proxy  data.  Taking  into  account  these  substantial
uncertainties, Mann et al. (1999) concluded that the 1990s were
likely  to  have  been  the  warmest  decade, and  1998  the  warmest
year, of the past millennium for at least the Northern Hemisphere.
Jones  et  al. (1998)  came  to  a  similar  conclusion  from  largely
independent  data  and  an  entirely  independent  methodology.
Crowley and Lowery (2000) reached the similar conclusion that
medieval  temperatures  were  no  warmer  than  mid-20th  century
temperatures. Borehole data (Pollack et al., 1998) independently
support  this  conclusion  for  the  past  500  years  although, as
discussed  earlier  (Section  2.3.2.1), detailed  interpretations
comparison  with  long-term  trends  from  such  of  such  data  are
perilous owing to loss of temporal resolution back in time.

The largely independent multi-proxy Northern Hemisphere
temperature reconstructions of Jones et al. (1998) and Mann et
al. (1999)  are  compared  in  Figure  2.21, together  with  an
independent (extra-tropical, warm-season) Northern Hemisphere
temperature estimate by Briffa (2000) based on tree-ring density
data.  The  estimated  uncertainties  shown  are  those  for  the
smoothed Mann et al. series. Significant differences between the
three reconstructions are evident during the 17th and early 19th
centuries where either the Briffa et al. or Jones et al. series lie
outside  the  estimated  uncertainties  in  the  Mann  et  al. series.
Much  of  these  differences  appear  to  result  from  the  different
latitudinal and seasonal emphases of the temperature estimates.
This conclusion is supported by the observation that the Mann et
al. hemispheric temperature average, when restricted to just the
extra-tropical  (30  to  70°N  band)  region  of  the  Northern
Hemisphere, shows  greater  similarity  in  its  trend  over  the  past
few centuries to the Jones et al. reconstruction. The differences
between  these  reconstructions  emphasise  the  importance  of
regional  and  seasonal  variations  in  climate  change.  These  are
discussed in the next section.

2.3.3  Was there a “Little Ice Age” and a “Medieval Warm 

Period”? 

The  terms  “Little  Ice Age” and  “Medieval  Warm  Period” have
been  used  to  describe  two  past  climate  epochs  in  Europe  and
neighbouring regions during roughly the 17th to 19th and 11th to
14th  centuries, respectively.  The  timing, however, of  these  cold
and  warm  periods  has  recently  been  demonstrated  to  vary
geographically over the globe in a considerable way (Bradley and

Jones, 1993; Hughes and Diaz, 1994; Crowley and Lowery, 2000).
Evidence from mountain glaciers does suggest increased glacia-
tion in a number of widely spread regions outside Europe prior to
the 20th century, including Alaska, New Zealand and Patagonia
(Grove  and  Switsur, 1994).  However, the  timing  of  maximum
glacial advances in these regions differs considerably, suggesting
that  they  may  represent  largely  independent  regional  climate
changes, not  a  globally-synchronous  increased  glaciation  (see
Bradley, 1999). Thus current evidence does not support globally
synchronous  periods  of  anomalous  cold  or  warmth  over  this
timeframe, and  the  conventional  terms  of  “Little  Ice Age” and
“Medieval  Warm  Period” appear  to  have  limited  utility  in
describing  trends  in  hemispheric  or  global  mean  temperature
changes in past centuries. With the more widespread proxy data
and  multi-proxy  reconstructions  of  temperature  change  now
available, the  spatial  and  temporal  character  of  these  putative
climate epochs can be reassessed. 

Mann et al. (1998) and Jones et al. (1998) support the idea
that the 15th to 19th centuries were the coldest of the millennium
over  the  Northern  Hemisphere  overall.  However, viewed
hemispherically, the “Little Ice Age” can only be considered as a
modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during this period of
less  than  1oC  relative  to  late  20th  century  levels  (Bradley  and
Jones, 1993; Jones et al., 1998; Mann et al., 1998; 1999; Crowley
and Lowery, 2000). Cold conditions appear, however, to have been
considerably more pronounced in particular regions. Such regional
variability can be understood in part as reflecting accompanying
changes in atmospheric circulation. The “Little Ice Age” appears
to have been most clearly expressed in the North Atlantic region as
altered patterns of atmospheric circulation (O’Brien et al., 1995).
Unusually cold, dry winters in central Europe (e.g., 1 to 2°C below
normal during the late 17th century) were very likely to have been
associated  with  more  frequent  flows  of  continental  air  from  the
north-east (Wanner et al., 1995; Pfister, 1999). Such conditions are
consistent (Luterbacher et al., 1999) with the negative or enhanced
easterly  wind  phase  of  the  NAO  (Sections  2.2.2.3  and  2.6.5),
which  implies  both  warm  and  cold  anomalies  over  different
regions  in  the  North Atlantic  sector.  Such  strong  influences  on
European temperature demonstrate the difficulty in extrapolating
the sparse early information about European climate change to the
hemispheric, let  alone  global, scale.  While  past  changes  in  the
NAO  have  likely  had  an  influence  in  eastern  North  America,
changes  in  the  El  Niño  phenomenon  (see  also  Section  2.6), are
likely to have had a particularly significant influence on regional
temperature patterns over North America.

The hemispherically averaged coldness of the 17th century
largely  reflected  cold  conditions  in  Eurasia, while  cold
hemispheric conditions in the 19th century were more associated
with cold conditions in North America (Jones et al., 1998; Mann
et al., 2000b). So, while the coldest decades of the 19th century
appear to have been approximately 0.6 to 0.7°C colder than the
latter decades of the 20th century in the hemispheric mean (Mann
et  al., 1998), the  coldest  decades  for  the  North  American
continent  were  closer  to  1.5°C  colder  (Mann  et  al., 2000b).  In
addition, the timing of peak coldness was often specific to partic-
ular  seasons.  In  Switzerland, for  example, the  first  particularly
cold winters appear to have been in the 1560s, with cold springs

beginning around 1568, and with 1573 the first unusually cold
summer (Pfister, 1995). 

The  evidence  for  temperature  changes  in  past  centuries  in
the  Southern  Hemisphere  is  quite  sparse.  What  evidence  is
available at the hemispheric scale for summer (Jones et al., 1998)
and  annual  mean  conditions  (Mann  et  al., 2000b)  suggests
markedly  different  behaviour  from  the  Northern  Hemisphere.
The only obvious similarity is the unprecedented warmth of the
late 20th century. Speleothem evidence (isotopic evidence from
calcite  deposition  in  stalagmites  and  stalactites)  from  South
Africa  indicates  anomalously  cold  conditions  only  prior  to  the
19th century, while speleothem (records derived from analysing
stalagmites  and  stalagtites)  and  glacier  evidence  from  the
Southern Alps of New Zealand suggests cold conditions during
the  mid-17th  and  mid-19th  centuries  (Salinger, 1995).
Dendroclimatic  evidence  from  nearby  Tasmania  (Cook  et  al.,
2000)  shows  no  evidence  of  unusual  coldness  at  these  times.
Differences  in  the  seasons  most  represented  by  this  proxy
information prevent a more direct comparison.

As with the “Little Ice Age”, the posited “Medieval Warm
Period” appears  to  have  been  less  distinct, more  moderate  in
amplitude, and somewhat different in timing at the hemispheric
scale  than  is  typically  inferred  for  the  conventionally-defined
European  epoch.  The  Northern  Hemisphere  mean  temperature
estimates of Jones et al. (1998), Mann et al. (1999), and Crowley
and  Lowery  (2000)  show  temperatures  from  the  11th  to  14th
centuries to be about 0.2°C warmer than those from the 15th to
19th centuries, but rather below mid-20th century temperatures.
The long-term hemispheric trend is best described as a modest
and  irregular  cooling  from AD  1000  to  around  1850  to  1900,
followed by an abrupt 20th century warming. Regional evidence
is, however, quite  variable.  Crowley  and  Lowery  (2000)  show
that western Greenland exhibited anomalous warmth locally only
around AD 1000 (and to a lesser extent, around AD 1400), with
quite cold conditions during the latter part of the 11th century,
while  Scandinavian  summer  temperatures  appeared  relatively
warm only during the 11th and early 12th centuries. Crowley and
Lowery  (2000)  find  no  evidence  for  warmth  in  the  tropics.
Regional  evidence  for  medieval  warmth  elsewhere  in  the
Northern Hemisphere is so variable that eastern, yet not western,
China appears to have been warm by 20th century standards from
the 9th to 13th centuries. The 12th and 14th centuries appear to
have been mainly cold in China (Wang et al., 1998a,b; Wang and
Gong, 2000).  The  restricted  evidence  from  the  Southern
Hemisphere, e.g., the  Tasmanian  tree-ring  temperature
reconstruction  of  Cook  et  al. (1999), shows  no  evidence  for  a
distinct Medieval Warm Period.

Medieval  warmth  appears, in  large  part, to  have  been
restricted  to  areas  in  and  neighbouring  the  North Atlantic. This
may  implicate  the  role  of  ocean  circulation-related  climate
variability. The Bermuda rise sediment record of Keigwin (1996)
suggests warm medieval conditions and cold 17th to 19th century
conditions in the Sargasso Sea of the tropical North Atlantic. A
sediment  record  just  south  of  Newfoundland  (Keigwin  and
Pickart, 1999), in contrast, indicates cold medieval and warm 16th
to  19th  century  upper  ocean  temperatures.  Keigwin  and  Pickart
(1999)  suggest  that  these  temperature  contrasts  were  associated

136

Observed Climate Variability and Change

with changes in ocean currents in the North Atlantic. They argue
that  the  “Little  Ice  Age” and  “Medieval  Warm  Period” in  the
Atlantic  region  may  in  large  measure  reflect  century-scale
changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (see Section 2.6). Such
regional changes in oceanic and atmospheric processes, which are
also relevant to the natural variability of the climate on millennial
and longer time-scales (see Section 2.4.2), are greatly diminished
or  absent  in  their  influence  on  hemispheric  or  global  mean
temperatures. 

2.3.4  Volcanic and Solar Effects in the Recent Record

Recent  studies  comparing  reconstructions  of  surface  tempera-
ture and natural (solar and volcanic) radiative forcing (e.g., Lean
et  al., 1995;  Crowley  and  Kim, 1996, 1999;  Overpeck  et  al.,
1997; Mann et al., 1998; Damon and Peristykh, 1999; Free and
Robock, 1999; Waple et al., 2001) suggest that a combination of
solar and volcanic influences have affected large-scale tempera-
ture  in  past  centuries.  The  primary  features  of  the  Northern
Hemisphere mean annual temperature histories of Mann et al.
(1999a) and Crowley and Lowery (2000) from AD 1000 to 1900
have  been  largely  reproduced  based  on  experiments  using  an
Energy  Balance  Model  forced  by  estimates  of  these  natural
radiative  forcings  (Crowley, 2000;  Mann, 2000)  making  the
argument that the “Little Ice Age” and “Medieval Warm Period”,
at the hemispheric mean scale, are consistent with estimates of
naturally-forced climate variability. Several studies indicate that
the combined effect of these influences has contributed a small
component  to  the  warming  of  the  20th  century.  Most  of  these
studies isolate greenhouse radiative forcing as being dominant
during  late  20th  century  warming  (see  Crowley, 2000).  This
argues  against  a  close  empirical  relationship  between  certain
sun-climate  parameters  and  large-scale  temperature  that  has
been  claimed  for  the  20th  century  (Hoyt  and  Schatten, 1997).
The reader is referred to Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of
these radiative forcings, and to Chapter 12 for comparisons of
observed and model simulations of recent climate change.

2.3.5  Summary

Since  the  SAR  there  have  been  considerable  advances  in  our
knowledge of temperature change over the last millennium. It is
likely  that  temperatures  were  relatively  warm  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere as a whole during the earlier centuries of the millen-
nium, but it is much less likely that a globally-synchronous, well
defined interval of “Medieval warmth” existed, comparable to the
near  global  warmth  of  the  late  20th  century.  Marked  warmth
seems to have been confined to Europe and regions neighbouring
the North Atlantic. Relatively colder hemispheric or global-scale
conditions did appear to set in after about AD 1400 and persist
through  the  19th  century, but  peak  coldness  is  observed  during
substantially different epochs in different regions. By contrast, the
warming  of  the  20th  century  has  had  a  much  more  convincing
global  signature  (see  Figure  2.9).  This  is  consistent  with  the
palaeoclimate evidence that the rate and magnitude of global or
hemispheric surface 20th century warming is likely to have been
the largest of the millennium, with the 1990s and 1998 likely to

have  been  the  warmest  decade  and  year, respectively, in  the
Northern Hemisphere. Independent estimates of hemispheric and
global ground temperature trends over the past five centuries from
sub-surface  information  contained  in  borehole  data  confirm  the
conclusion that late 20th century warmth is anomalous in a long-
term context. Decreasing temporal resolution back in time of these
estimates  and  potential  complications  in  inferring  surface  air
temperature trends from sub-surface ground temperature measure-
ments precludes, however, a meaningful direct comparison of the
borehole  estimates  with  high-resolution  temperature  estimates
based on other proxy climate data. Because less data are available,
less is known about annual averages prior to 1,000 years before the
present  and  for  conditions  prevailing  in  most  of  the  Southern
Hemisphere prior to 1861.

2.4  How Rapidly did Climate Change in the Distant Past?

2.4.1  Background

Only  during  the  1980s  was  the  possibility  of  rapid  climatic
changes  occurring  at  the  time-scale  of  human  life  more  or  less
fully recognised, largely due to the Greenland ice core drilled at
Dye 3 in Southern Greenland (Dansgaard et al., 1982, 1989). A
possible link between such events and the mode of operation of the
ocean  was  then  subsequently  suggested  (Oeschger  et  al., 1984;
Broecker et al., 1985; see Broecker, 1997, for a recent review).
The SAR reviewed the evidence of such changes since the peak of
the last inter-glacial period about 120 ky BP (thousands of years
Before  Present).  It  concluded  that: (1)  large  and  rapid  climatic
changes occurred during the last Ice Age and during the transition
towards  the  present  Holocene;  (2)  temperatures  were  far  less
variable  during  this  latter  period;  and  (3)  suggestions  that  rapid
changes  may  have  also  occurred  during  the  last  inter-glacial
required confirmation.

These  changes  are  now  best  documented  from  ice  core,
deep-sea sediment and continental records. Complementary and
generally discontinuous information comes from coral and lake
level  data.  The  time-scale  for  the  Pleistocene  deep-sea  core
record  is  based  on  the  orbitally  tuned  oxygen  isotope  record
from marine sediments (Martinson et al., 1987), constrained by
two  radiometrically  dated  horizons, the  peak  of  the  last  inter-
glacial (about 124 ky BP) and the Brunhes/Matuyama reversal
of the Earth’s magnetic field at about 780 ky BP. 14C-dating is
also used in the upper 50 ky BP; the result is a deep-sea core
chronology believed to be accurate to within a few per cent for
the  last  million  years.  14C-dating  is  also  used  for  dating
continental records as well as the counting of annual layers in
tree  rings  and  varved  lake  records, whereas  ice-core  chron-
ologies are obtained by combining layer counting, glaciological
models  and  comparison  with  other  dated  records.  The  use  of
globally representative records, such as changes in continental
ice  volume  recorded  in  the  isotopic  composition  of  deep-sea
sediments, or changes in atmospheric composition recorded in
air bubbles trapped in ice cores, now allow such local records to
be put into a global perspective. Studies still largely focus on the
more  recent  glacial-interglacial  cycle  (the  last  120  to  130  ky).

Figure 2.22: Variations of temperature, methane, and atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentrations derived from air trapped within ice
cores from Antarctica (adapted from Sowers and Bender, 1995;
Blunier et al., 1997; Fischer et al., 1999; Petit et al., 1999).

Before  reviewing  important  recent  information  about  rapid
changes, we briefly mention progress made on two aspects of the
palaeoclimate record of relevance for future climate. The first deals
with the relationship between modern and past terrestrial data and
SSTs around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (about 20 ky
BP); this is important because of the use of glacial data to validate
climate  models.  New  results  obtained  since  the  SAR  both  from
marine and terrestrial sources (reviewed in Chapter 8), agree on a
tropical cooling of about 3°C. The second concerns the greenhouse
gas  record  (CO2 and  CH4)  which  has  now  been  considerably
extended due to the recent completion of drilling of the Vostok ice

core  in  central  East Antarctica.  The  strong  relationship  between
CO2 and  CH4 and  Antarctic  climate  documented  over  the  last
climatic cycle has been remarkably confirmed over four climatic
cycles, spanning about 420 ky (Figure 2.22). Present day levels of
these  two  important  greenhouse  gases  appear  unprecedented
during this entire interval (Petit et al., 1999; and Figure 2.22). From
a detailed study of the last three glacial terminations in the Vostok
ice core, Fischer et al. (1999) conclude that CO2 increases started
600 ± 400 years after the Antarctic warming. However, considering
the large uncertainty in the ages of the CO2 and ice (1,000 years or
more if we consider the ice accumulation rate uncertainty), Petit et
al.  (1999)  felt  it  premature  to  ascertain  the  sign  of  the  phase
relationship between CO2 and Antarctic temperature at the initia-
tion  of  the  terminations.  In  any  event, CO2 changes  parallel
Antarctic  temperature  changes  during  deglaciations  (Sowers  and
Bender, 1995;  Blunier  et  al., 1997;  Petit  et  al., 1999).  This  is
consistent with a significant contribution of these greenhouse gases
to the glacial-interglacial changes by amplifying the initial orbital
forcing (Petit et al., 1999).

We also now have a better knowledge of climate variability
over the last few climatic cycles as illustrated by selected palaeo-
temperature  records  back  to  about  400  ky  (Figure  2.23).  The
amplitude of the glacial-interglacial temperature change was lower
in tropical and equatorial regions (e.g., curve c) than in mid- and
high latitudes (other curves). During glacial periods, the climate of
the North Atlantic and adjacent regions (curves a and b) was more
variable  than  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  (curve  d).  Also  (not
shown), full glacial periods were characterised by very high fluxes
of  dust  (seen  in  ice-core  records  and  in  continental  and  marine
records). A  combination  of  increased  dust  source  area, stronger
atmospheric  transport  and  a  weaker  hydrological  cycle  (Yung et
al., 1996;  Mahowald  et  al., 1999;  Petit  et  al., 1999)  probably
generated these changes.

Figure 2.23: Time-series illustrating temperature variability over the
last about 400 ky (updated from Rostek et al., 1993; Schneider et al.,
1996; MacManus et al., 1999; Reille et al., 2000). The uppermost
time-series describes the percentage of tree pollen that excludes pollen
from pine tree species. The higher this percentage, the warmer was the
climate.

2.4.2  How Stable was the Holocene Climate? 

Ice core, marine and terrestrial records show that the Holocene
was marked by a millennial-scale mode of variability (Meese et
al., 1994;  O’Brien  et  al., 1995;  Bond  et  al., 1997; Yiou  et  al.,
1997a,b). These variations affect both atmospheric (Mayewski et
al., 1997) and oceanic (Bianchi and McCave, 1999) indicators.
The occurrence of very large floods in the south-western United
States also reflects substantial low-frequency variability (Ely et
al., 1993).  SSTs  reconstructed  from  analyses  of  a  sub-tropical,
high  sedimentation  rate  site  off  West  Africa  might  indicate  a
remarkably high amplitude Holocene variability of 5 to 8°C on a
time-scale about 1,500 years (deMenocal, 1998). During the later
Holocene, New  Zealand  speleothems  indicate  a  lowering  of
temperature  after  about  7  ky  BP, with  small  advances  of  the
mountain glaciers in the Southern Alps near about 4 and 2.5 ky
BP  (Salinger  and  McGlone, 1989).  Speleothem  records  also

indicate a temperature decrease of about 1.5°C some 2 to 3 ky
ago (Williams et al., 1999). These indications are consistent with
cooler  periods  at  these  times  shown  by  South  African
speleothems  (Partridge, 1997).  By  contrast, temperature  peaks
appeared in China at about 7 ky BP and at 5.5 to 6 ky BP (Wang
and Gong, 2000).

Central  Greenland  ice  cores  and  European  lake  isotopic
records  show  correlated  temperature  variations  within  the
Holocene, with  a  roughly  50%  higher  amplitude  at  Summit
Greenland, compared  to  Europe  (Figure  2.24).  The  most
prominent event in both records occurred about 8,200 years BP
(Alley et al., 1997; von Grafenstein et al., 1998; Barber et al.,
1999) when annual mean temperatures dropped by as much as
2°C  in  mid-Europe  and  the  European  alpine  timberline  fell  by
about 200 m (Wick and Tinner, 1999). The event may be related
to a significant decrease of SST in the Norwegian Sea (Klitgaard-
Kristensen et al., 1998). Lake records from the southern border
of the Sahara indicate extremely dry conditions during this time,
and probably also during other cool but less dramatic events of
this kind (Street-Perrot and Perrot, 1990 ; Gasse and Van Campo,
1994).  The  about  8,200  year  cooling  may  also  have  been
worldwide (Stager and Mayewski, 1997), although abrupt early
Holocene climate changes recorded in a North American lake are
thought to reflect a different event (Hu et al., 1999). Thus cooling
is  indicated  in  the  New  Zealand  Southern  Alps, with  small
advances  of  the  mountain  glaciers  at  about  8,000  years  BP
(Salinger and McGlone, 1989). 

Further abrupt climatic changes and reversals on millennial
time-scales during the Holocene are documented from pollen and
lake  level  records  e.g., in  Europe  (Magny, 1995;  Pazdur  et  al.,
1995; Combourieu-Nebout et al., 1998), North Africa (Gasse et
al., 1990;  Lamb  et  al., 1995), North America  (Jacobson  et  al.,
1987;  Overpeck  et  al., 1991)  and  Australia  (Kershaw et  al.,
1991). Holocene lake level changes in Europe have been shown
to correlate (Magny, 1995; Yu and Harrisson, 1996) with millen-
nial-scale  changes  in  North  Atlantic  SST  and  salinity  records
(Duplessy et al., 1992; Gasse and van Campo, 1994), suggesting
a  possible  link  between  millennial  thermohaline  circulation
variability and atmospheric circulation over Europe.

The  early  Holocene  was  generally  warmer  than  the  20th
century but the period of maximum warmth depends on the region
considered. It is seen at the beginning of the Holocene (about 11 to
10 ky BP) in most ice cores from high latitude regions e.g., north-
west Canada (Ritchie et al., 1989), central Antarctica (Ciais et al.,
1992; Masson et al., 2000) and in some tropical ice cores such as
Huascaran in Peru (Thompson et al., 1995). It is also seen during
the early Holocene in the Guliya ice core in China (Thompson et
al., 1998) but not in two other Chinese cores (Dunde, Thompson et
al., 1989; and Dasuopu, to be published). North Africa experienced
a  greatly  expanded  monsoon  in  the  early  and  mid-Holocene,
starting at 11 ky BP (Petit-Maire and Guo, 1996), and declining
thereafter.  In  New  Zealand  the  warmest  conditions  occurred
between about 10 to 8 ky BP, when there was a more complete
forest  cover  than  at  any  other  time.  Glacial  activity  was  at  a
minimal  level  in  the  Southern  Alps  and  speleothem  analyses
indicate  temperatures  were  about  2°C  warmer  than  present
(Salinger and McGlone, 1989; Williams et al., 1999).

 Thousands of years before present (KY Bp)

Figure 2.24: Records of climate variability during the Holocene and the last climatic transition, including the 8.2 ky BP event (adapted from
Johnsen et al., 1992; Hughen et al., 1996; Thompson et al., 1998; von Grafenstein et al., 1999; Jouzel et al., 2001). The shaded areas show the
8.2 ky BP event, the Younger Dryas event and the Antarctic Cold Reversal. The grey scale used in the Tropical North Atlantic record is a
measure of sea surface temperature, deduced from the colour of plankton rich layers within an ocean sediment core.

By  contrast, central  Greenland  (Dahl-Jensen  et  al., 1998),
and  regions  downstream  of  the  Laurentide  ice  sheet, did  not
warm  up  until  after  8  ky  BP  (including  Europe: COHMAP
Members, 1988; eastern North America: Webb et al., 1993). The
East Asian monsoon did not commence its expanded phase until
after 8 ky BP (Sun and Chen, 1991; Harrison et al., 1996; Yu and
Qin, 1997; Ren and Zhang, 1998). A more detailed description of
the climate at 6 ky BP as well as of the mechanisms involved is
given  in  Chapter  8.  Long-term  climate  changes  during  the
Holocene  are  consistent  with  the  effects  of  orbital  forcing,
modified by the persistence of the Laurentide ice sheet (which
finally disappeared around 6 ky BP). 

Seasonal  to  interannual  climate  variability  may  also  have
varied  its  character  during  the  Holocene.  This  is  a  period  for

which a variety of palaeo-proxies and archaeological investiga-
tions (e.g., Sandweiss et al., 1996; Rodbell et al., 1999) provide
evidence  for  past  variations  in  the  strength  and  frequency  of
ENSO extremes. A 16-year long time-series of temperature and
hydrological balance from a coral dated at 5,370 years BP from
the Great Barrier Reef (Gagan et al., 1998) implies that ENSO,
or its teleconnections to Australia, were substantially different in
the  mid-Holocene  than  today.  Mid-Holocene  changes  in  the
spectrum  of  ENSO  variability  have  also  been  implicated  by
sedimentary  palaeoclimatic  records  in Australasia  (McGlone  et
al., 1992;  Shulmeister  and  Lees, 1995)  and  South  America
(Sandweiss et al., 1996; Rodbell et al., 1999). 

To  sum  up, the  Holocene  shows  both  long-term  trends
(including changes in the nature of ENSO) and millennial time-

140

Observed Climate Variability and Change

scale variability although the amplitude of the variability is small
compared with that characteristic of Ice Ages. As more detailed
information  becomes  available, the  timing  of  the  Holocene
maximum  warmth  is  seen  to  differ  across  the  globe.  There
appears  to  be  a  south  to  north  pattern, with  southern  latitudes
displaying  maximum  warming  a  few  millennia  before  the
Northern  Hemisphere  regions.  Interestingly, the  Holocene
appears by far the longest warm “stable” period (as far as seen
from  the  Antarctic  climate  record)  over  the  last  400  ky, with
profound implications for the development of civilisation (Petit et
al., 1999).

2.4.3  How Fast did Climate Change during the Glacial Period?

The most extreme manifestation of climate change in the geolog-
ical record is the transition from full glacial to full inter-glacial
conditions.  During  the  most  recent  glacial  cycle, peak  glacial
conditions  prevailed  from  about  25  to  18  ky  BP. Temperatures
close to those of today were restored by approximately 10 ky BP.
However, warming  was  not  continuous.  The  deglaciation  was
accomplished  in  two  main  stages, with  a  return  to  colder
conditions  (Younger  Dryas/Antarctic  Cold  Reversal)  or, at  the
least, a pause in the deglaciation. 

The central Greenland ice core record (GRIP and GISP2) has
a  near  annual  resolution  across  the  entire  glacial  to  Holocene
transition, and reveals episodes of very rapid change. The return
to  the  cold  conditions  of  the Younger  Dryas  from  the  incipient
inter-glacial warming 13,000 years ago took place within a few
decades or less (Alley et al., 1993). The warming phase, that took
place about 11,500 years ago, at the end of the Younger Dryas was
also very abrupt and central Greenland temperatures increased by
7°C or more in a few decades (Johnsen et al., 1992; Grootes et al.,
1993; Severinghaus et al., 1998). Most of the changes in wind-
blown  materials  and  some  other  climate  indicators  were
accomplished  in  a  few  years  (Alley  et  al., 1993;  Taylor  et  al.,
1993; Hammer et al., 1997). Broad regions of the Earth experi-
enced almost synchronous changes over periods of 0 to 30 years
(Severinghaus et al., 1998), and changes were very abrupt in at
least some regions (Bard et al., 1987), e.g. requiring as little as 10
years  off  Venezuela  (Hughen  et  al., 1996).  Fluctuations  in  ice
conductivity  indicate  that  atmospheric  circulation  was  reorgan-
ised extremely rapidly (Taylor et al., 1993). A similar, correlated
sequence of abrupt deglacial events also occurred in the tropical
and temperate North Atlantic (Bard et al., 1987; Hughen et al.,
1996) and in Western Europe (von Grafenstein et al., 1999). 

A Younger-Dryas type event is also recorded in a Bolivian
ice  core  (Thompson  et  al., 1998;  Sajama, South  America  in
Figure 2.24) and in a major advance of a mountain glacier in the
Southern  Alps  of  New  Zealand  (Denton  and  Hendy, 1994).
However there is recent evidence against a significant Younger
Dryas cooling here (Singer et al., 1998) and at other sites of the
Southern  Hemisphere  (reviewed  by  Alley  and  Clarke, 1999).
Instead, the Antarctic (and Southern Ocean) climate was charac-
terised  by  a  less  pronounced  cooling  (the  Antarctic  Cold
Reversal: Jouzel et al., 1987) which preceded the Younger Dryas
by more than 1 ky (Jouzel et al., 1995; Sowers and Bender, 1995;
Blunier  et  al., 1997).  Curiously, one  coastal  site  in Antarctica,

Taylor Dome (Steig et al., 1998) exhibited cooling in phase with
the North Atlantic. Recent series obtained at Law Dome, another
coastal  site  of  East  Antarctica, show  instead  a  cold  reversal
preceding the Younger Dryas as in other Antarctic records. This
suggests that the Taylor Dome record is of limited geographical
significance but it also suggests that there is more to be discov-
ered about this cooling event in the Southern Hemisphere.

The inception of deglacial warming about 14.5 ky BP was
also  very  rapid, leading  to  the  Bölling-Alleröd  warm  period  in
less than twenty years (Severinghaus and Brook, 1999). Almost
synchronously, major vegetation changes occurred in Europe and
North America with a rise in African lake levels (Gasse and van
Campo, 1994).  There  was  also  a  pronounced  warming  of  the
North  Atlantic  and  North  Pacific  (Koç  and  Janssen, 1994;
Sarnthein  et  al., 1994;  Kotilainen  and  Shackleton, 1995;
Thunnell and Mortyn, 1995; Wansaard, 1996; Watts et al., 1996;
Webb et al., 1998).

The  rate  of  temperature  change  during  the  recovery  phase
from  the  last  glacial  maximum  provides  a  benchmark  against
which to assess warming rates in the late 20th century. Available
data indicate an average warming rate of about 2°C/millennium
between about 20 and 10 ky BP in Greenland, with lower rates
for  other  regions.  Speleothem  data  from  New  Zealand, and
positions of mountain glacier moraine termini suggest warming
rates  of  2°C/millennium  from  15  to  13  ky  BP  (Salinger  and
McGlone, 1989).  Speleothem  data  for  South  Africa  suggest  a
warming  rate  of  1.5°C/millennium  (Partridge, 1997)  over  the
same time period. On the other hand, very rapid warming at the
start of the Bölling-Alleröd period, or at the end of the Younger
Dryas may have occurred at rates as large as 10°C/50 years for a
significant part of the Northern Hemisphere.

Oxygen  isotope  measurements  in  Greenland  ice  cores
demonstrate  that  a  series  of  rapid  warm  and  cold  oscillations
called Dansgaard-Oeschger events punctuated the last glaciation
(Figure 2.23, see North Atlantic SST panel, and Dansgaard et al.,
1993). Associated temperature changes may be as high as 16°C
(Lang  et  al., 1999). These  oscillations  are  correlated  with  SST
variations in several North Atlantic deep-sea cores (Bond et al.,
1993). There was clearly a close relation between these ice core
temperature  cycles  and  another  prominent  feature  of  North
Atlantic  deep-sea  core  records, the  Heinrich  events.  Heinrich
events occurred every 7,000 to 10,000 years during times of sea
surface  cooling  in  the  form  of  brief, exceptionally  large,
discharges  of  icebergs  from  the  Laurentide  and  European  ice
sheets which left conspicuous layers of detrital rocks in deep-sea
sediments.  Accompanying  the  Heinrich  events  were  large
decreases in the oxygen isotope ratio of planktonic foraminifera,
providing evidence of lowered surface salinity probably caused
by  melting  of  drifting  ice  (Bond  et  al., 1993).  Heinrich  events
appear at the end of a series of saw-toothed shaped, near millen-
nial temperature cycles. Each set of millennial cycles is known as
a Bond cycle. Each cycle was characterised by a succession of
progressively  cooler  relatively  warm  periods  (interstadials)
during the Ice Age period. Each cooling trend ended with a very
rapid, high  amplitude, warming  and  a  massive  discharge  of
icebergs.  The  impact  of  these  Heinrich  events  on  the  climate
system extended far beyond the northern North Atlantic. At the

Observed Climate Variability and Change

141

time of major iceberg discharges, strong vegetation changes have
been detected in Florida (Grimm et al., 1993; Watts et al., 1996),
oceanic  changes  occurred  in  the  Santa  Barbara  Basin  off
California (Behl and Kennet, 1996) and changes in loess grain-
size, associated with atmospheric circulation changes, have been
detected in China (Porter and An, 1995; Ding et al., 1998). 

Deep-sea cores also show the presence of ice rafting cycles
in the intervals between Heinrich events (Bond and Lotti, 1995).
Their  duration  varies  between  2,000  and  3,000  years  and  they
closely coincide with the Dansgaard-Oeschger events of the last
glaciation. A study of the ice-rafted material suggests that, coinci-
dent  with  the  Dansgaard-Oeschger  cooling, ice  within  the
Icelandic ice cap and within or near the Gulf of Saint Lawrence
underwent nearly synchronous increases in rates of calving. The
Heinrich  events  reflect  a  slower  rhythm  of  iceberg  discharges,
probably from the Hudson Strait. 

Air  temperature, SST  and  salinity  variations  in  the  North
Atlantic are associated with major changes in the thermohaline
circulation.  A  core  from  the  margin  of  the  Faeroe-Shetland
channel covering the last glacial period reveals numerous oscilla-
tions in benthic and planktonic foraminifera, oxygen isotopes and
ice-rafted detritus (Rasmussen et al., 1996a). These oscillations
correlate with the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, showing a close
relationship between  the deep ocean circulation and the abrupt
climatic  changes  of  the  last  glaciation.  Warm  episodes  were
associated with higher SST and the presence of oceanic convec-
tion in the Norwegian Greenland Sea. Cold episodes were associ-
ated  with  low  SST  and  salinity  and  no  convection  in  the
Norwegian Greenland Sea (Rasmussen et al., 1996b). Cores from
the  mid-latitudes  of  the  North  Atlantic  show  that  the  iceberg
discharges in Heinrich events resulted in both low salinity and a
reduced  thermohaline  circulation  (Cortijo  et  al., 1997; Vidal  et
al., 1997).

These  rapid  climatic  events  of  the  last  glacial  period, best
documented in Greenland and the North Atlantic, have smoothed
counterparts  in  Antarctica  (Bender  et  al., 1994;  Jouzel  et  al.,
1994). A peak in the concentration of the isotope beryllium-10 in
ice  cores  (Yiou  et  al., 1997a), changes  in  the  concentration  of
atmospheric  methane  (Blunier  et  al., 1998)  and  in  the  isotopic
content of oxygen in ice cores (Bender et al., 1999) indicate links
between  the  Northern  and  Southern  Hemisphere  climates  over
this period. Large Greenland warming events around 36 and 45
ky BP lag their Antarctic counterparts by more than 1,000 years.
This  argues  against  coupling  between  northern  and  southern
polar regions via the atmosphere but favours a connection via the
ocean (Blunier et al., 1998).

New  evidence  suggests  that  the  North  Atlantic  has  three
modes  of  operation. These  are: deep-water  sinking  in  the  GIN
(Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian)  Seas  and  the  Labrador  Sea,
deep-water sinking in the North Atlantic or in the Labrador Sea
but  not  the  GIN  Seas  (Duplessy  et  al., 1991;  Labeyrie  et  al.,
1992)  in  the  cold  phase  of  Dansgaard-Oeschger  events  and  at
glacial  maximum, and  little  deep-water  sinking  in  the  GIN  or
Labrador Seas (Heinrich events) (Sarnthein et al., 1994; Vidal et
al., 1997, 1998; Alley and Clark, 1999; Stocker, 2000). The first
type  corresponds  to  modern, warm  conditions.  Shut-down  of
convection  in  the  GIN  Seas  has  a  strong  effect  on  the  high

latitude Atlantic atmosphere and on areas that respond to it such
as  the  monsoon  regions  of  north  Africa  (Street-Perrott  and
Perrott, 1990). However, cross-equatorial Atlantic ocean surface
transport that supplies the water for the formation of the Labrador
Sea deep-water continues to remove heat from the South Atlantic
under these conditions. The additional “Heinrich shut-down” of
the North Atlantic and Labrador Sea deep-water formation allows
this  heat  to  remain  in  the  South Atlantic  (Crowley, 1992), and
may  increase  deep-water  formation  either  south  of  the  area
affected by melt-water injection (Vidal et al., 1997, 1998) or in
the Southern Ocean (Broecker, 1998). This reorganisation could
cause warming of regions of the South Atlantic and downwind of
it (Charles et al., 1996; Blunier et al., 1998) through a seesaw
relationship with the North Atlantic. However, the behaviour of
Taylor Dome in the Antarctic and several other southern sites (see
above)  which  exhibit  cooling  in  phase  with  the  North Atlantic
argue  for  an  additional  atmospheric  link  to  some  southern
regions. 

2.4.4  How Stable was the Previous Inter-glacial?

Assessment  of  present  day  climate  variability  benefits  from
comparison with conditions during inter-glacial periods that are
broadly  comparable  with  the  Holocene.  The  most  recent  such
inter-glacial began about 130 ky BP, lasting until about 71 ky BP
when  final  deterioration  into  the  last  glacial  began.  However,
only  the  Eemian  interval, from  about  130  to  120  ky  BP
corresponds to a climate as warm as, or warmer than, today e.g.,
Figure 2.22.

The study of atmospheric composition changes has revealed
that rapid changes of properties observed for the lowest part of
the Greenland cores (GRIP Project Members, 1993; Grootes et
al., 1993) do not correspond to climatic instabilities during the
last inter-glacial (Chappellaz et al., 1997). The extent to which
climate was more or less stable during this last inter-glacial than
during the Holocene is unclear. Early evidence from marine cores
(CLIMAP, 1984;  McManus  et  al., 1994)  and  other  ice  cores
(Jouzel et al., 1993) indicated that the Eemian climate was rather
stable. A high resolution North Atlantic record shows a lack of
substantial  fluctuations  during  the  last  inter-glacial  but  also
indicates that the Eemian began and ended with abrupt changes
in  deep-water  flow, with  transitions  occurring  in  less  than  400
years (Adkins et al., 1997). In New Zealand, there were at least
three  periods  of  milder  climate  than  typical  of  the  Holocene
during the last inter-glacial (Salinger and McGlone, 1989). Study
of  an  Indonesian  fossil  coral  indicates  that  ENSO  was  robust
during the last glacial period (Hughen et al., 1999).

A  rapid  and  significant  cooling  event  within  the  Eemian
period  has  been  detected  from  European  continental  pollen
records  (Cheddadi  et  al., 1998).  High  winter  temperatures
prevailed for 3.5 to 4 ky after the deglaciation, but then dropped
by as much as 6 to 10°C in mid-Eemian times, accompanied by
a decrease in precipitation. In Antarctica, the last inter-glacial is
also marked by a short (about 5 ky) period of warm temperatures
followed by a slightly cooler interval (Petit et al., 1999). Further
evidence  for  Eemian  climate  variability  is  found  in  marine
records. An invasion of cold, low salinity water in the Norwegian

142

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Sea  (Cortijo  et  al., 1994)  was  probably  associated  with  a
reduction in warm water transport by the North Atlantic Drift and
the  thermohaline  circulation.  Overall, the  last  inter-glacial
appears, at  least  during  its  first  part, warmer  than  present  day
climates by at least 2°C in many sites, i.e., comparable to anthro-
pogenic  warming  expected  by  the  year  2100.  However, the
geographical  coverage  of  reliable  and  well-dated  temperature
time-series is too sparse to provide a global estimate. 

2.4.5  Summary

Current evidence indicates that very rapid and large temperature
changes, generally  associated  with  changes  in  oceanic  and
atmospheric  circulation, occurred  during  the  last  glacial  period
and during the last deglaciation, particularly in higher latitudes of
the Northern Hemisphere. During the warming phases, and the
Younger  Dryas  pause, there  is  evidence  of  almost  worldwide,
nearly  synchronous  events.  However, as  with  the  Holocene
maximum  warming  and  the  Last  Glacial  Maximum, these
changes  appear  to  have  occurred  asynchronously  between  the
Northern  Hemisphere  and  at  least  part  of  the  Southern
Hemisphere. During the Holocene smaller but locally quite large
climate changes occurred sporadically; similar changes may have
occurred  in  the  last  inter-glacial.  Evidence  is  increasing,
therefore, that a rapid reorganisation of atmospheric and ocean
circulation  (time-scales  of  several  decades  or  more)  can  occur
during inter-glacial periods without human interference.

2.5  How have Precipitation and Atmospheric Moisture 

Changed?

2.5.1   Background

Increasing global surface temperatures are very likely to lead to
changes  in  precipitation  and  atmospheric  moisture, because  of
changes  in  atmospheric  circulation, a  more  active  hydrological
cycle, and increases in the water holding capacity throughout the
atmosphere.  Atmospheric  water  vapour  is  also  a  climatically
critical greenhouse gas, and an important chemical constituent in
the troposphere and stratosphere. 

Precipitation  measurement  and  analysis  are  made  more
difficult by accompanying natural phenomena such as wind and
the  use  of  different  instruments  and  techniques  (Arkin  and
Ardanuy, 1989).  Because  of  the  substantial  under-catch  of
precipitation  gauges  during  solid  precipitation, frequent  light
rainfall events, or windy conditions, the true precipitation in the
Arctic  is  more  than  50%  higher  than  the  measured  values
(Førland  and  Hanssen-Bauer, 2000).  Gauge  under-catch  is
substantially  less  in  warmer, less  windy  climates  with  heavier
rainfall.  New, satellite-derived  precipitation  estimates  offer  the
prospect of near-global climatologies covering at least one or two
decades, but  multi-decadal  global  changes  cannot  be  estimated
with high confidence. 

For all these reasons it is useful to compare changes in many
of  the  moisture-related  variables, such  as  streamflow  and  soil
moisture, with precipitation to help validate long-term precipita-
tion trends. 

2.5.2  Changes in Precipitation and Related Variables

2.5.2.1  Land
Overall, global  land  precipitation  has  increased  by about  2%
since the beginning of the 20th century (Jones and Hulme, 1996;
Hulme et al., 1998). The increase is statistically significant but
has  been  neither  spatially  nor  temporally  uniform  (Karl  and
Knight, 1998; Doherty et al., 1999). Dai et al. (1997b) found a
global secular increase in precipitation separate from ENSO and
other  modes  of  variability.  Data  from  over  20,000  stations
contributed to the changes since 1900 shown in Figure 2.25. The
effects  of  changes  in  windshields  on  winter  precipitation
measurements were taken into account for most mid- and high
latitude  observations.  Dai  et  al.  (1997b)  indicated  that  instru-
mental discontinuities are unlikely to significantly impact other
observations. 

Mid- and high latitudes
Over  the  20th  century, annual  zonally  averaged  precipitation
increased by between 7 to 12% for the zones 30°N to 85°N and by
about 2% between 0°S to 55°S (Figure 2.25(ii)). The increase in
the  Northern  Hemisphere  is  likely  to  be  slightly  biased  because
adjustments  have  not  been  made  for  the  increasing  fraction  of
precipitation falling in liquid as opposed to frozen form. The exact
rate of precipitation increase depends on the method of calculating
the  changes, but  the  bias  is  expected  to  be  small  because  the
amount of annual precipitation affected by this trend is generally
only about a few per cent. Nevertheless, this unsteady, but highly
statistically significant trend toward more precipitation in many of
these  regions  is  continuing.  For  example, in  1998  the  Northern
Hemisphere high latitudes (55°N and higher) had their wettest year
on  record  and  the  mid-latitudes  have  had  precipitation  totals
exceeding the 1961 to 1990 mean every year since 1995. 

Figure  2.25(i)  shows  mostly  increasing  precipitation  in  the
Northern  Hemisphere  mid-  and  high  latitudes, especially  during
the autumn and winter, but these increases vary both spatially and
temporally. For example, precipitation over the United States has
increased by between 5 to 10% since 1900 (Figure 2.25(ii)) but this
increase has been interrupted by multi-year anomalies such as the
drought  years  of  the  1930s  and  early  1950s  (Karl  and  Knight,
1998;  Groisman  et  al., 1999).  The  increase  is  most  pronounced
during the warm seasons. Using data selected to be relatively free
of anthropogenic influences such as ground water pumpage or land
use changes, several recent analyses (Lettenmaier et al., 1999; Lins
and Slack, 1999; Groisman et al., 2001) have detected increases in
streamflow  across  much  of  the  contiguous  United  States,
confirming  the  general  tendency  to  increasing  precipitation.
However, Lins  and  Michaels  (1994)  found  in  some  regions  that
increased streamflow did not relate well to an increase in rainfall.
This  has  been  further  evaluated  by  Groisman  et  al.  (2001)  who
show that changes in snow-cover extent also influence the timing
and volume of streamflow. 

Regionally, Mekis and Hogg (1999) showed that precipita-
tion in Canada has increased by an average of more than 10%
over the 20th century. Zhang et al. (2000) report an increase in
Canadian heavy snowfall amounts north of 55°N and Akinremi et
al. (1999) found rainfall significantly increasing in the Canadian

Observed Climate Variability and Change

143

prairies  from  1956  to  1995.  Multi-decadal  streamflow  data  in
Canada are not extensive, but there are no apparent inconsisten-
cies  between  observed  changes  in  streamflow  or  precipitation
(Zhang et al., 2000).

Over  the  last  50  years  there  has  been  a  slight  decrease  in
annual  precipitation  over  China  (Zhai  et  al., 1999a), which  is
supported by a significant (5% confidence level) decrease in the
number of rainy days (3.9%/decade; Figure 2.25 (ii)). In contrast,
the area affected by the upper 10% of heaviest precipitation has
significantly  increased.  Zhai  et  al.  (1999b)  show  a  significant
increase in precipitation over the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze  River  and  west  China  during  the  latter  part  of  the  20th
century, while also detecting a declining trend in precipitation over
northern China.

There  have  been  marked  increases  in  precipitation  in  the
latter  part  of  the  20th  century  over  northern  Europe, with  a
general  decrease  southward  to  the  Mediterranean  (Schönwiese
and Rapp, 1997; Figure 2.25(i)). Dry wintertime conditions over
southern Europe and the Mediterranean (Piervitali et al., 1998;
Romero  et  al., 1998)  and  wetter  than  normal  conditions  over
many parts of northern Europe and Scandinavia (Hanssen-Bauer
and  Førland, 2000)  are  linked  to  strong  positive  values  of  the
North  Atlantic  Oscillation, with  more  anticyclonic  conditions
over  southern  Europe  and  stronger  westerlies  over  northern
Europe (Section 2.6.5). 

Based  on  recent  research  (Bogdanova  and  Mescherskaya,
1998; Groisman and Rankova, 2001), the precipitation trend for the
last century over the former USSR as reported by the SAR was
slightly overestimated. The new results indicate that precipitation
has increased since 1891 by about 5% west of 90°E for both warm
and cold seasons. Georgievsky et al. (1996) also noted increases in
precipitation  over  the  last  several  decades  over  western  Russia,
accompanied by increases in streamflow and a rise in the level of
the Caspian Sea. In eastern Russia a negative precipitation trend
since 1945 is embedded in the century-long positive precipitation
trend (Figure 2.25(ii); Gruza et al., 1999). Soil moisture data for
large regions of Eurasia (Robock et al., 2000) show large upward
trends.  The  rate  of  increase  is  more  than  1  cm/decade  in  the
available soil moisture in the top 1 m of soil. These large positive
trends  occur  simultaneously  with  positive  trends  in  temperature
that would normally reduce soil moisture. Increases in precipita-
tion (and cloud cover, Section 2.5.5) are believed to have more than
compensated for the increased losses due to evapotranspiration. 

An  analysis  of  rainfall  data  since  1910  by  Haylock  and
Nicholls (2000) reveals a large decrease in total precipitation and
related rain days in south-western Australia. Annual total rainfall
has increased over much of Australia with significant increases of
15 to 20% in large areas. The increase in total rainfall has been
accompanied by a significant 10% rise in the average number of
rain days over Australia (Hennessy et al., 1999). Elsewhere in the
Southern  Hemisphere, a  long-term  increase  in  precipitation  in
Argentina has been observed for the period 1900 to 1998 (Figure
2.25(i); Dai et al., 1997b).

Tropics and sub-tropics
The  increase  in  precipitation  in  the  mid-  and  high  latitudes
contrasts  with  decreases  in  the  northern  sub-tropics  (with

marginal statistical significance) which were largely responsible
for  the  decade-long  reduction  in  global  land  precipitation
from  the  mid-1980s  through  the  mid-1990s.  Since  the  SAR,
record  low  precipitation  has  been  observed  in  equatorial
regions, while  the  sub-tropics  have  recovered  from  their
anomalously low values of the 1980s. 

Regionally  positive  but  non-significant  trends  have
occurred in the rainy season rainfall in north-east Brazil and
northern Amazonia  (Marengo  et  al., 1998).  River  data  from
northern Amazonia indicate wetter periods in the mid-1970s,
and in 1990, as well as drier periods between 1980 to 1990,
consistent  with  rainfall  anomalies.  Northern  Amazonian
rainfall  appears  to  be  modulated  by  multi-decadal  climate
variations. 

There  is  little  evidence  for  a  long-term  trend  in  Indian
monsoonal  rainfall  but  there  are  multi-decadal  variations
(Kumar et al., 1999a,b). From 1906 to about 1960, monsoonal
rainfall  increased  then  decreased  through  1974  and  has
increased since (see Section 2.6). In central America for much
of the period from the early 1940s to present, western Mexico
has  experienced  an  increasingly  erratic  monsoonal  rainfall
(Douglas and Englehart, 1999).

Since 1976, increases in precipitation in the South Pacific
have  occurred  to  the  north-east  of  the  South  Pacific
Convergence Zone (SPCZ) while decreases have occurred to
its  south-west  (Salinger  et  al., 1996).  Manton  et  al.  (2001)
found significant decreases in rain days since 1961 throughout
Southeast  Asia  and  western  and  central  South  Pacific, but
increases in the north of French Polynesia and Fiji.

Streamflow  data  for  major  rivers  in  south-eastern  South
America for the period 1901 to 1995 show that streamflow has
increased  since  the  mid-1960s, and  was  accompanied  by  a
significant decrease in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of
most  of  those  rivers  (Garcia  and Vargas, 1998;  Genta  et  al.,
1998).  Figure  2.25(i)  shows  increases  in  precipitation  since
1900  along  the  South  American  eastern  coastal  areas, with
less extensive increases since 1976.

There has been a pattern of continued aridity since the late
1960s throughout North Africa south of the Sahara. This pattern
is most persistent in the western region. The driest period was
in  the  1980s  with  some  recovery  occurring  during  the  1990s,
particularly  in  the  easternmost  sectors  where  rainfall  in  some
years was near or just above the long-term mean (Nicholson et
al., 2000).  Southern Africa  was  relatively  moist  in  the  1950s
and  1970s  (Nicholson  et  al., 2000);  but  Hulme  (1996)  found
significant decreases in precipitation being observed since the
late 1970s. Early 2000, however, has seen flood-producing rains
in the eastern part of southern Africa. 

2.5.2.2  Palaeo-drought 
Palaeoclimate proxy evidence (tree rings, lake sediments and
pollen  evidence)  has  been  used  to  estimate  variability  in
drought and precipitation patterns in past centuries. Much of
the recent research has emphasised the North American region
(e.g., Cook et al., 1999a), where a key conclusion is that the
range of regional drought variability observed during the 20th
century  may  not  be  representative  of  the  larger  range  of

Figure 2.25(i): Trends for 1900 to 1999 for the four seasons.
Precipitation trends are represented by the area of the circle with green
representing increases and brown representing decreases. Annual and
seasonal trends were calculated using the following method.
Precipitation anomalies in physical units were calculated for each
station based on 1961 to 1990 normals and averaged into 5° × 5° grid
cells on a monthly basis. The 1961 to 1990 monthly mean precipita-
tion for each grid cell was added to the monthly anomalies and the
resulting grid cell values summed into annual and seasonal totals. This
series was converted into percentages of normal precipitation, and
trends calculated from the percentages. Average trends within six
latitude bands (85°N to 55°N, 55°N to 30°N, 30°N to 10°N, 10°N to
10°S, 10°S to 30°S, 30°S to 55°S) are shown in the legend of each
map. The 1961 to 1990 monthly mean precipitation for the latitude
band was added to the anomaly time-series and the resulting values
totalled across all months within the season or year. The significance
of each trend (based on a 5% level) was determined using a t-test and a
non-parametric test statistic. Trends found to be significant under both
tests are indicated with an asterisk.

Figure 2.25(ii): As in Figure 2.25(i) except annual trends for the three
periods of changing rates of global temperature (shown in Figure 2.9)
and the full period, 1900 to 1999. During the 100-year periods,
calculation of grid cell trends required at least 66% of the years
without missing data and at least three years of data within each
decade except the first and last. During the shorter periods, calculation
of grid cell trends required at least 75% of the years without missing
data. Stations with more than one sixth of their data missing during the
normal period and grid cells with more than one season or year
without any measurable precipitation during the normal period were
excluded from consideration. Due to the nature of trend estimation, it
is not possible to cumulatively sum the trends for each of the three
periods to obtain an overall trend.

drought  evident  in  past  centuries  (Laird  et  al., 1996;
Woodhouse  and  Overpeck, 1998).  Hughes  and  Graumlich
(1996) and Hughes and Funkhouser (1999) provide evidence
of multi-decadal mega-droughts in the western Great Basin of
North America in the 10th to 14th centuries. Nonetheless, the
20th  century  dust  bowl  still  stands  out  as  the  most  extreme
drought of the past several centuries, the period when North
American  continental  scale  reconstruction  is  possible.
Swetnam  and  Betancourt  (1998)  argue  that  recent  spring
wetness  in  the  American  south-west  is  greater  than  that
observed  in  at  least  the  last  thousand  years.  Evidence  of
significant  changes  in  regional  hydroclimatic  patterns  is  not
limited, however, to North America. Stine (1994) argues that
enhanced drought conditions occurred synchronously in South
America. Ice accumulation at Quelccaya in the Andes, and on
the Dunde Ice Cap on the Tibetan Plateau (Thompson, 1996)
was slower in the first half of the last millennium than the last
500 years, but 500-year averages are not easily related to the
palaeo-temperature  data  (Figure  2.21).  Pollen  evidence
indicates  significant  changes  in  summer  rainfall  patterns  in
China  in  the  earlier  centuries  of  the  past  millennium  (Ren,
1998). The relationship between such past changes in regional
drought  and  precipitation  patterns, and  large-scale
atmospheric  circulation  patterns  associated  with  ENSO, for
example, is an area of active current research (e.g., Cole and
Cook, 1998). 

2.5.2.3  Ocean 
The strong spatial variability inherent in precipitation requires
the use of estimates based on satellite observations for many
regions.  Thus  satellite  data  are  essential  to  infer  global
changes in precipitation, as the oceans account for 70% of the
global  surface  area.  Since  adequate  observations  were  not
made  until  the  early  1970s, no  satellite-based  record  is
sufficiently long to permit estimates of century-long changes.
The  first  satellite  instrument  specifically  designed  to  make
estimates of precipitation did not begin operation until 1987.
At  this  time  three  data  sets  are  available: (a)  the  Global
Precipitation  Climatology  Project  (GPCP)  product, which
spans  the  period  from  1987  to  the  present  (Huffman  et  al.,
1997); (b) the CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP)
product, covering  the  period  from  1979  to  1998  (Xie  and
Arkin, 1997);  and  (c)  MSU-derived  precipitation  estimates
since  1979  (Spencer, 1993).  While  the  period  from  1987
appears to be well observed, it is too short to draw conclusions
regarding decadal-scale variations. The longer CMAP data set
assumes  that  the  various  satellite-derived  estimates  have  no
trend over the period, and hence no longer time-scale conclu-
sions  are  possible.  Nonetheless, analyses  of  the  CMAP
product and associated data from the NCEP reanalysis project
indicate that there have been substantial average increases in
precipitation  over  the  tropical  oceans  during  the  last  twenty
years, related  to  increased  frequency  and  intensity  of  ENSO
(Trenberth  et  al., 2001).  ENSO  conditions  are  not  related  to
positive precipitation anomalies everywhere over the tropical
oceans (e.g., south-western Tropical Pacific).

2.5.3  Water Vapour

Although  measurement  problems  hinder  the  analysis  of  long-
term  water  vapour  changes  (Elliott, 1995;  Rind, 1998), several
recent studies tend to confirm and extend the findings of lower
tropospheric  water  vapour  increases  reported  in  the  SAR.
Furthermore, new  analyses  indicate  upward  trends  in  near-
surface humidity. Knowledge about changes in water vapour at
upper  tropospheric  and  lower  stratospheric  levels  is  of  great
importance  because  strong  alterations  in  radiative  forcing  can
result from small absolute changes in water vapour at these levels
(Chapters 6 and 7). New data presented here from the SPARC
WAVAS  (Stratospheric  Processes  and  their  Role  in  Climate  /
Water Vapour Assessment) project (Kley et al., 2000) are starting
to cast light on changes at these levels. Note that water vapour
pressure, and specific humidity (for a constant relative humidity)
increase non-linearly with increasing temperature.

2.5.3.1  Surface water vapour
Water  vapour  pressure, dew-point  or  relative  humidity  at  the
surface  is  conventionally  measured  using  wet  and  dry  bulb
thermometers  exposed  in  thermometer  screens  at  climate
stations. The quality of these data has been little studied. Wet bulb
thermometers are not usually aspirated, so that the cooling of the
wet bulb, and therefore the deduced specific or relative humidity,
depends on the flow rate of air within the screen. This may often
differ from the assumed airflow. Occasionally wet bulbs may dry
out. Thus it is not possible to judge fully the accuracy of surface
vapour pressure trends presented here.

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Schönwiese et al. (1994) and Schönwiese and Rapp (1997)
found  small  increases  in  surface  vapour  pressure  over  most  of
Europe  from  1961  to  1990.  The  annual  trends  are  weak.
Statistically  significant  changes  are  confined  to  increases  of
about 0.5 to 1.5 hPa (relative to mean values of 12 to 15 hPa) in
the southern and eastern Mediterranean region (with the largest
increase in summer) and decreases of about 0.5 hPa over parts of
Turkey (mainly in springtime). 

Specific  humidity  trends  over  the  United  States  were
overwhelmingly  positive  for  the  period  1961  to  1995, with
magnitudes of several per cent per decade, and with the largest
and  most  statistically  significant  trends  in  spring  and  summer
(Gaffen  and  Ross, 1999).  Night-time  specific  humidity  trends
were generally stronger than daytime trends. Relative humidity
showed  smaller  increases, especially  in  winter  and  spring. The
specific  humidity  and  derived  dew  point  trends  are  broadly
consistent, both spatially and in their day-night differences, with
temperature  trends.  Schwartzman  et  al.  (1998)  found  that  the
diurnal dewpoint cycle is changing over North America, with a
relative decline in late afternoon and a small rise at midday. 

Increases  in  water  vapour  over  the  former  Soviet  Union,
Eastern  China, the  United  States  and  tropical  Western  Pacific
islands have been found in some seasons by Sun et al. (2000) in
the second half of the 20th century, but with decreases in Canada
in autumn. The selective character of the findings prevents any
assessment  of  statistical  significance. Wang  and  Gaffen  (2001)
found that specific humidity trends over China were overwhelm-
ingly positive over 1951 to 1994, with the largest and most statis-
tically significant trends in north-west China north of 35°N and

west  of  105°E.  Trends  were  larger  in  summer  and  night-time
trends were generally larger than daytime ones.

Recently New et al. (2000) have estimated linear trends for
annual and seasonal values of surface vapour pressure over land
using  calculated  monthly  vapour  pressure  data  from  climate
stations. Figure 2.26 shows trends for the 21 years from 1975 to
1995, corresponding  to  much  of  the  recent  period  of  global
warming  described  in  Section  2.2.2.3.  Although  the  uncertain
quality of the data prevents any definitive conclusions about statis-
tical significance, nominal significance of trends at the 5% level
was  estimated  after  smoothing  the  annual  data  to  reduce  the
influence of outliers at the beginning and end of this short series.
Few  Southern  Hemisphere  data  have  been  analysed, but  Figure
2.26 shows that there have been widespread nominally significant
increases  in  annual  mean  water  vapour  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere.  These  increases  are  reflected  in  the  individual
seasons, although nominally significant annual mean increases are
more  extensive.  Regional  decreases  over  eastern  Canada  are
explained by colder conditions in the winter half year associated
with  the  increasingly  positive  phase  of  the  North  Atlantic
Oscillation (Section 2.6.5).

2.5.3.2  Lower-tropospheric water vapour
Radiosonde and satellite observations of water vapour above the
surface  have  been  analysed  for  evidence  of  long-term  change.
Both  data  sources  have  had  serious  data  quality  and  temporal
homogeneity  problems  (Elliott, 1995), although  recent  work  to
determine  trends  in  water  vapour  from  the  surface  to  500  hPa
since 1973 has been based on radiosonde data judged to be largely
unaffected by these problems (Ross and Elliott, 2001). Published
satellite data are insufficiently homogeneous or too short in length
to deduce reliable trends or low-frequency variations. 

Radiosonde observations
Ross and Elliott (1996, 1998) analysed surface-to-500 hPa precip-
itable water over the Northern Hemisphere for 1973 to 1995 using
quality-controlled data. Increases in precipitable water were found
over North America except for north-east Canada. Over Eurasia,

only  China  and  the  Pacific  islands  show  coherent  regional
increases. The remainder of Eurasia shows a mixture of positive
and  negative  trends, with  a  tendency  for  negative  trends  over
Eastern  Europe  and  western  Russia.  Mid-tropospheric  water
vapour trends tend to be of the same sign as temperature trends
over  North America, China, and  the  Pacific, but  elsewhere  the
temperature trends are more consistently positive than the water
vapour trends. Figure 2.27 summarises the results. Lower-tropo-
spheric  dew-point  data  for  the  period  1961  to  1995  also  show
increases, though smaller than those for the 1973 to 1995 period,
and few are statistically significant (Ross and Elliott, 2001). 

Zhai  and  Eskridge  (1997)  found  increases  of  about  1  to
3%/decade in surface-to-200 hPa precipitable water over China
for  1970  to  1990.  Increases  were  most  significant  in  spring.
Percentage trends were larger over the 700 to 400 hPa layer than
the  surface-700  hPa  layer.  Gutzler  (1996)  found  that  specific
humidity data at 1,000, 700, and 300 hPa at four western tropical
Pacific radiosonde stations from 1973 to 1993 gave increases of
3 to 9%/decade, with larger percentage increases at increasing
height above the surface. In contrast, Peixoto and Oort (1996)
found decreases in zonal mean relative humidity between 1974
and  1988.  The  decreases  are  more  marked  at  300  hPa, where
they are more likely to be associated with instrument changes
than at lower levels, and are more pronounced at higher latitudes
than in the tropics. 

2.5.3.3  Upper-tropospheric and lower-stratospheric water 

vapour 

Recently assessed increases in lower stratospheric water vapour
mixing ratio over the last few decades are likely to have caused a
decrease in stratospheric temperatures by an amount comparable
to that produced by ozone decreases (Forster and Shine, 1999;
Smith et al., 2001) (see lower-stratospheric temperature trends in
Section  2.2.3). These  changes  also  impact  on  ozone  chemistry
(Chapter 4) and on radiative forcing of the atmosphere (Chapters
6 and 7). Data from over twenty-five instruments that measure
water  vapour  concentration  and  relative  humidity  in  the  upper
troposphere  and  stratosphere  were  recently  compared  and

Observed Climate Variability and Change

assessed  in  the  international  SPARC  study  (Kley  et  al., 2000).
The purpose of the study, which included measurements made by
both  in  situ  and  remote  sensing  techniques  utilising  balloons,
aircraft and satellites, was to determine the data quality and to
estimate  the  magnitude  of  any  trends.  The  study  showed  that
some stratospheric instruments have sampled over a long enough
period that several overlapping time-series of intermediate length
(8 to 15 years) can be used to help evaluate stratospheric changes.
A  reasonable  degree  of  consistency  was  found  among  strato-
spheric measurements made from near the tropopause up to as
high  as  50  km  (about  1  hPa).  Most  observations  were  within
±10% of the grand mean of all measurements to which they were
compared. 

Accurate balloon observations of lower-stratospheric water
vapour are available from 1964 to 1976 over Washington, D.C.
and  from  1980  to  present  over  Boulder, Colorado, USA  (e.g.,
Mastenbrook, 1968;  Harries, 1976;  Mastenbrook  and  Oltmans,
1983; Oltmans and Hofmann, 1995). The SPARC study shows
that these point measurements are nevertheless representative of
global stratospheric conditions above about 18 to 20 km, but not
of the lowest stratosphere where there can be significant regional
and  seasonal  changes.  A  positive  lower  stratosphere  trend  of
about 1 to 1.5%/year in specific humidity (about 0.04 ppm/year)
since the mid-1960s is indicated by the balloon data (Oltmans et
al., 2000). The increase was not monotonic but showed several
rapid  rises  with  plateaux  in  between.  Even  though  the  recent
satellite  record  is  relatively  short, these  measurements  have
revealed changes of the same character. The satellite results show
a spatial pattern of trends in the lower stratosphere, and suggest a
slowing  in  the  positive  trend  after  1996  (Smith  et  al., 2000).
Although  not  definitive, these  observations  are  consistent  in
suggesting  that  lower-stratospheric  water  vapour  has  increased
globally on average at about 1%/year over at least the past forty
years, but at a variable rate.

Although  radiosondes  have  made  observations  of  water
vapour in the upper troposphere (i.e., above 500 hPa) since the
1950s, these observations have suffered from instrumental errors
(Elliott  and  Gaffen, 1991).  Peixoto  and  Oort  (1996)  have  re-
examined  these  observations  for  the  period  1974  to  1988  and
found large trends in upper-tropospheric humidity at the 300 hPa
level. They concluded that these trends were unrealistically large
and  were  likely  to  be  due  to  instrument  changes.  Satellite
observations  of  upper-tropospheric  humidity  (UTH)  measure-
ments made by TOVS (Television infrared observation satellite
Operational Vertical Sounder) since 1979, and representative of
a deep layer between 500 to 200 hPa, show very large interan-
nual variability (Bates et al., 1996). The SPARC assessment of
these observations (Kley et al., 2000) indicated that they were of
sufficient quality for trend analyses. The SPARC study and an
analysis by Bates and Jackson (2001) show large regional trends
that are attributed to circulation changes associated with ENSO,
decadal  variability  over  equatorial  Africa, and  decadal
variability  of  the  Arctic  Oscillation  (see  Section  2.6).
Statistically  significant  positive  trends  of  0.1%/year  are  found
for 10°N to 10°S, and a non-significant trend of 0.04%/year for
60°N to 60°S, but this includes a component negative trend of
–0.1%/year  for  30oS  to  60oS. The  trends  in  large  zonal  bands

tend to be residuals from cancellations in sign and magnitude of
much larger regional trends. These UTH trends should be treated
with caution especially in the deep tropics because of significant
interannual  variability  and  persistence, both  of  which  hamper
trend detection. 

In  summary, in  situ and  radiosonde  measurements  tend  to
show increasing water vapour in the lower troposphere and near
the surface, though this is not seen everywhere, and data quality
is still an issue. The longer, more reliable data sets suggest multi-
decadal increases in atmospheric water vapour of several per cent
per  decade  over  regions  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  New
analyses  of  balloon  and  satellite  records  indicate  that  strato-
spheric water vapour above 18 km shows an increase of about
1%/year for the period 1981 to 2000 but with a slowing of the
positive trend after 1996. Satellite observations of upper-tropo-
spheric humidity from 1980 to 1997 show statistically significant
positive trends of 0.1%/year for the zone 10°N to 10°S.

2.5.4  Evaporation

Only evaporation from the land surface is discussed, as nothing
new since the SAR has emerged on oceanic evaporation changes.

2.5.4.1  Land
The SAR reported widespread decreases of pan evaporation over
the  USA  and  Russia  during  the  20th  century.  Pan  evaporation
measurements are an index of evaporation from a surface with an
unlimited supply of water (potential evaporation). Interpretation
of  this  result  involving  potential  evaporation  as  a  decrease  in
actual  land  surface  evaporation  is  contradictory  to  the  temp-
erature and precipitation increase reported in these areas, and the
general  intensification  of  the  hydrological  cycle  over  northern
extra-tropical land areas (Brutsaert and Parlange, 1998). Further
analysis  by  Lawrimore  and  Peterson  (2000)  supports  Brutsaert
and  Parlange’s  (1998)  interpretation, as  does  Golubev  et  al.
(2001). Using parallel observations of actual evaporation and pan
evaporation  at  five  Russian  experimental  sites, Golubev  et  al.
(2001)  developed  a  method  to  estimate  actual  land  surface
evaporation  from  the  pan  evaporation  measurements.  They
showed  that  using  this  method, actual  evaporation  is  shown  to
have increased during the second half of the 20th century over
most dry regions of the United States and Russia. Similarly, over
humid maritime regions of the eastern United States (and north-
eastern  Washington  state)  actual  evaporation  during  the  warm
season was also found to increase. Only over the heavily forested
regions  of  Russia  and  the  northern  United  States  did  actual
evaporation  decrease.  The  increase  in  actual  evaporation  is
related to the greater availability of moisture at the surface, due
to increases in precipitation and the higher temperatures. 

2.5.5  Clouds

Clouds  are  important  in  the  Earth’s  climate  system  because  of
their effects on solar radiation, terrestrial radiation and precipita-
tion. Different cloud types contribute to total cloud amount and
are  associated  with  a  wide  variety  of  thermal  and  dynamic
processes in the climate system (see Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2).

Observed Climate Variability and Change

149

Therefore  knowing  the  variations  in  total  cloud  amount  and
different cloud types would significantly contribute to improving
our understanding of the role of clouds in contemporary climate
change.  Several  analyses  of  cloud  amounts  for  regions  of  the
world have been performed since the SAR. Problems with data
homogeneity, particularly concerning biases with changing times
of observation (Sun and Groisman, 2000; Sun et al., 2001) have
been addressed in several studies, but other issues continue to be
a source of uncertainty. 

2.5.5.1  Land
Dai  et  al.  (1997a, 1999)  and  Kaiser  (1998)  examined  cloud
cover changes over the former USSR and China during the last
four to five decades, to add to earlier analyses for Europe, the
United  States, Canada, and  Australia  by  Henderson-Sellers
(1992) and Karl and Steurer (1990). These studies show 20th
century  increases  in  cloud  cover  over  much  of  the  United
States  (mostly  confined  to  the  first  80  years)  and  the  former
USSR, which  are  significantly  negatively  correlated  with
changes in the diurnal range of surface air temperature (DTR)
(as  shown  earlier  in  Figure  2.3).  Sun  and  Groisman  (2000)
showed that in the former USSR low-level cloud cover signif-
icantly  decreased  during  the  period  1936  to  1990. However,
this was more than offset by a significant increase in cumulus
and cirrus clouds during the past several decades. Over much
of  China, however, daytime  and  night-time  total  cloud  cover
exhibited  significant  decreasing  trends  of  1  to  2%  sky
cover/decade  for  both  day  and  night  observations  between
1951 and 1994 (Kaiser, 1998, 2000), which the DTR failed to
follow  (Figure  2.3).  This  discrepancy  may  result  from  the
increasing  effect  of  industrial  aerosols  on  the  DTR  since  the
late 1970s (Dai et al., 1999). Tuomenvirta et al. (2000) show
increasing trends in cloud cover during the period 1910 to 1995
for northern Europe, which are consistent with decreases in the
DTR. A new analysis (Neff, 1999) reveals a dramatic increase
(15 to 20%) of spring and summer cloud amount at the South
Pole during the past four decades in this region. This appears
to  be  related  to  the  observed  delay  in  the  breakdown  of  the
spring polar vortex and is believed to be related to decreases in
stratospheric temperatures.

There are few analyses of the amounts of various cloud types
or  changes  over  the  tropics  and  sub-tropics.  Correlations  with
observed precipitation and clouds observed by satellites suggest
that much of the increase in the total cloud amount is likely to
have resulted from increases in thick, precipitating clouds (Dai et
al., 1997a).  Hahn  et  al.  (1996)  show  decreasing  decadal  scale
trends in cloud cover over much of China, as well as over most
of South America and Africa for the period 1971 to 1991. The
latter two areas have little surface-based information.

2.5.5.2  Ocean 
The SAR presented analyses of inter-decadal changes in marine
cloud coverage. The data have now been re-examined and doubt
has been cast on some of the previous findings (Bajuk and Leovy,
1998a; Norris, 1999). Additional data have also reversed some of
the previous trends. In the SAR a 3% increase in cumulonimbus
clouds was reported for the period 1952 to 1981. An update of

this  analysis  showed  a  gradual  rise  in  cumulonimbus  cloud
amount  from  the  mid-1950s  to  the  mid-1970s, with  a  gradual
decline thereafter (Bajuk and Leovy, 1998a). Bajuk and Leovy
(1998b)  cast  doubt  on  the  homogeneity  of  the  cloud  amounts
derived from ship data. They find that inter-decadal variations of
the frequency of occurrence of cloud amount for a given cloud
type  are  generally  unrelated  to  similar  time-scale  variations  in
SST  and  large-scale  divergence  of  the  surface  winds.
Nonetheless, some regional changes and variations based on ship
reports of low and middle clouds are likely to be rather robust.
Variations  in  these  categories  of  cloud  are  consistent  with
variations of other climate system variables. Examples include:
(1)  a  long-term  upward  trend  in  altostratus  and  nimbostratus
across the mid-latitude North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans
(Parungo et al., 1994; Norris and Leovy, 1995); (2) ENSO related
variations in the frequency of low cloud types across the Pacific
and Indian Oceans (Bajuk and Leovy, 1998b); and (3) interannual
variations in summer season stratiform clouds across the North
Pacific (Norris et al., 1998). Norris (1999) found an increase in
total sky cover of approximately 2%, and an increase of approx-
imately  4%  in  low  cloud  cover  in  his  analyses  of  ship  reports
between  1952  and  1995.  He  finds  no  evidence  for  changes  in
observation  practices  that  may  have  affected  these  trends.  The
trends are dominated by a globally consistent mode and are as
large or larger in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere as in the
Northern  Hemisphere.  This  argues  against  attribution  to
increased anthropogenic aerosol amounts. 

2.5.5.3  Global
Although satellite estimates of changes and variations in cloud
amount and type contain systematic biases, Rossow and Schiffer
(1999) showed improved calibration and cloud detection sensitiv-
ities  for  the  International  Satellite  Cloud  Climatology  Program
(ISCCP)  data  set.  Using  data  from  1983  to  1994, a  globally
increasing trend in monthly mean cloudiness reversed during the
late 1980s and early 1990s. There now appears to be an overall
trend  toward  reduced  total  cloud  amounts  over  both  land  and
ocean during this period. An estimate for aircraft-induced cirrus
cover for the late 1990s ranges from 0 to 0.2% of the surface of
the Earth (IPCC, 1999).

2.5.6  Summary

Since  the  SAR, land  surface  precipitation  has  continued  to
increase  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  mid-  and  high  latitudes;
over  the  sub-tropics, the  drying  trend  has  been  ameliorated
somewhat. Where data are available, changes in annual stream-
flow  relate  well  to  changes  in  total  precipitation.  Over  the
Southern Hemisphere land areas no pronounced changes in total
precipitation are evident since the SAR. The changes in precip-
itation in mid- and high latitudes over land have a strong correl-
ation with long-term changes in total cloud amount. Little can be
said  about  changes  in  ocean  precipitation  as  satellite  data  sets
have  not  yet  been  adequately  tested  for  time-dependent  biases.
Changes in water vapour have been analysed most for selected
Northern Hemisphere regions, and show an emerging pattern of
surface and tropospheric water vapour increases over the past few

150

Observed Climate Variability and Change

decades, although there are still untested or uncorrected biases in
these  data.  Limited  data  from  the  stratosphere  also  suggest
increases  in  water  vapour  but  this  result  must  be  viewed  with
great caution. Over land, an increase in cloud cover of a few per
cent since the turn of the century is observed, which is shown to
closely  relate  to  changes  in  the  diurnal  temperature  range.
Changes  in  ocean  cloud  amount  and  type  show  systematic
increases of a few per cent since the 1950s, but these relate poorly
to SST or surface wind divergence changes, casting some doubt
on the integrity of the trends. No changes in observing practices
can be identified, however, that might have led to time-dependent
biases in the ocean cloud amount and frequency statistics.

2.6  Are the Atmospheric/Oceanic Circulations Changing?

2.6.1  Background

Changes or fluctuations in atmospheric and oceanic circulation
are important elements of climate. Such circulation changes are
the  main  cause  of  variations  in  climate  elements  on  a  regional
scale, sometimes mediated by parallel changes in the land surface
(IPCC, 1990, 1996).  ENSO  and  NAO  are  such  examples.  On
decadal time-scales, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and
the related Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) may account
for  approximately  half  the  global  mean  variation  in  surface
temperatures.  They  are  also  prominently  linked  to  regional
variations in temperature and precipitation (Higgins et al., 2000).
This section documents regional changes and slow fluctuations in
atmospheric circulation over past decades, and demonstrates that
these are consistent with large-scale changes in other variables,
especially temperature and precipitation. Note that there is much
evidence  that  many  of  the  atmospheric  circulation  changes  we
observe, particularly  in  the  extra-tropics, are  the  net  result  of
irregular fluctuations between preferred states of the atmosphere
(Palmer, 1993, 1999)  that  last  for  much  shorter  times.  Thus
changes in circulation on decadal time-scales involve changes in
the  frequency  of  such  states.  Chapter  7  discusses  this  in  more
detail.  The  focus  of  this  section  is  on  long-term  variation  and
change, rather than on shorter-term variability.

2.6.2  El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Tropical/Extra-tropical 

Interaction

ENSO is the primary global mode of climate variability in the
2 to 7 year time band. El Niño is defined by SST anomalies in
the eastern tropical Pacific while the Southern Oscillation Index
(SOI) is a measure of the atmospheric circulation response in
the Pacific-Indian Ocean region. This sub-section assesses the
variability of ENSO over the past few centuries. 

Multiproxy-based  reconstructions  of  the  behaviour  of
ENSO have recently been attempted for the past few centuries,
including a boreal winter season SOI reconstruction based on
highly ENSO-sensitive tree-ring indicators (Stahle et al., 1998).
A  multiproxy-based  reconstruction  of  the  boreal  cold-season
(Oct-Mar) NINO 3 (SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific from
5°N to 5°S, 150°W to 90°W) index (Mann et al., 2000b) has
also been made. Figure 2.28 compares the behaviour of these

reversed in sign to be positively correlated with the NINO 3 series. An
instrumental NINO 3 index from 1871 to 2000 is shown for compar-

two series with recent ENSO behaviour. The SOI reconstruction
has been rescaled to have the sign and variance of the NINO 3
reconstruction; the two reconstructions, based on independent
methods and partially independent data, have a linear correla-
tion  (r=0.64)  during  the  pre-calibration  interval.  While  the
estimated  uncertainties  in  these  reconstructed  series  are
substantial, they  suggest  that  the  very  large  1982/83  and
1997/98 warm events might be outside the range of variability
of the past few centuries. However, the reconstructions tend to
underestimate  the  amplitude  of  ENSO  events, as  is  clearly
evident for the large 1877/78 event. Only a richer network of
ENSO-sensitive  proxy  indicators  can  improve  this  situation,
such as the new long tropical coral series becoming available
(see Dunbar and Cole, 1999).

Instrumental  records  have  been  examined  to  search  for
possible changes in ENSO over the past 120 years. Three new
reconstructions of SST in the eastern Equatorial Pacific (Figure
2.29)  that  use  optimum  interpolation  methods  exhibit  strong
similarities.  The  dominant  2  to  6  year  time-scale  in  ENSO  is
apparent. Both the activity and periodicity of ENSO have varied
considerably  since  1871  with  considerable  irregularity  in  time.
There was an apparent “shift” in the temperature of the tropical
Pacific around 1976 to warmer conditions, discussed in the SAR,
which appeared to continue until at least 1998. During this period
ENSO  events  were  more  frequent, intense  or  persistent.  It  is
unclear whether this warm state continues, with the persistance of
the long La Niña from late 1998 until early 2001. ENSO has been
related to variations of precipitation and temperature over much
of the tropics and sub-tropics, and some mid-latitude areas.

ably reliable reconstructions can be made.

A  number  of  recent  studies  have  found  changes  in  the
interannual variability of ENSO over the last century, related in
part to an observed reduction in ENSO variability between about
1920 and 1960. Various studies (Wang and Wang, 1996; Torrence
and  Compo, 1998;  Torrence  and  Webster, 1998;  Kestin  et  al.,
1999)  show  more  robust  signals  in  the  quasi-biennial  and
‘classical’ 3 to 4 year ENSO bands (3.4 and 7 years) during the
first and last 40 to 50 years of the instrumental record. A period
of  very  weak  signal  strength  (with  a  near  5-year  periodicity)
occurs in much of the intervening epoch. 

The 1990s have received considerable attention, as the recent
behaviour  of  ENSO  seems  unusual  relative  to  that  of  previous
decades.  A  protracted  period  of  low  SOI  from  1990  to  1995,
during which several weak to moderate El Niño events occurred
with no intervening La Niña events (Goddard and Graham, 1997)
was found by some studies (e.g., Trenberth and Hoar, 1996) to be
statistically very rare. Whether global warming is influencing El
Niño, especially given the remarkable El Niño of 1997/98, is a
key  question  (Trenberth, 1998b), especially  as  El  Niño  affects
global temperature itself (Section 2.2 and Chapter 7). 

2.6.3  Decadal to Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation, and the 

North Pacific Oscillation

Recently, ‘ENSO-like’ spatial  patterns  in  the  climate  system,
which operate on decadal to multi-decadal time-scales, have been
identified. This lower-frequency SST variability is less equatori-
ally  confined  in  the  central  and  eastern  Pacific, and  relatively
more prominent over the extra-tropics, especially the north-west

Pacific, and has a similar counterpart in night marine air temper-
atures (Tanimoto et al., 1993; Folland et al., 1999a; Allan, 2000).
The  corresponding  sea  level  pressure  (SLP)  signature  is  also
strongest  over  the  North  Pacific, and  its  December-February
counterpart  in  the  mid-troposphere  more  closely  resembles  the
Pacific-North  America  (PNA)  pattern  (Zhang  et  al., 1997b;
Livezey  and  Smith, 1999).  There  is  ambiguity  about  whether
inter-decadal  Pacific-wide  features  are  independent  of  global
warming. In the longer Folland et al. (1999) analyses since 1911
they  appear  to  be  largely  independent, but  in  the  Livezey  and
Smith analysis of more recent SST data they are an integral part
of a global warming signal. Using a different method of analysis
of data since 1901, Moron et al. (1998) find a global warming
signal whose pattern in the Pacific is intermediate between these
two analyses.

The  PDO  of  Mantua  et  al.  (1997), with  lower-frequency
variations  in  the  leading  North  Pacific  SST  pattern, may  be
related  to  the  same  Pacific-wide  features, and  parallels  the
dominant pattern of North Pacific SLP variability. The relation-
ship is such that cooler than average SSTs occur during periods
of lower than average SLP over the central North Pacific and
vice versa. Recently, the IPO, a Pacific basin-wide feature, has
been  described, which  includes  low-frequency  variations  in
climate  over  the  North  Pacific  (Power  et  al., 1998, 1999;
Folland et al., 1999a). The time-series of this feature is broadly
similar to the inter-decadal part of the North Pacific PDO index
of  Mantua  et  al.  (1997).  The  IPO  may  be  a  Pacific-wide
manifestation of the PDO and seems to be part of a continuous
spectrum of low-frequency modulation of ENSO, and so may
be partly stochastic. When the IPO is in a positive phase, SST
over a large area of the south-west Pacific is cold, as is SST over
the  extra-tropical  north-west  Pacific.  SST  over  the  central
tropical  Pacific  is  warm  but  less  obviously  warm  over  the
equatorial  far  eastern  Pacific  unlike  ENSO.  Warmth  also
extends into the tropical west Pacific, unlike the situation on the
ENSO time-scale. 

The IPO shows three major phases this century: positive from
1922  to  1946  and  from  1978  to  at  least  1998, with  a  negative
phase  between  1947  and  1976.  Arguably, the  structure  of  this
pattern, nearly  symmetrical  about  the  equator  and  only  subtly
different from ENSO, is a strong indication of the importance of
the tropical Pacific for many remote climates on all time-scales
(Garreaud and Battisti, 1999). Power et al. (1999) showed that the
two  phases  of  the  IPO  appear  to  modulate  year-to-year  ENSO
precipitation  variability  over  Australia.  Salinger  and  Mullan
(1999) showed that prominent sub-bidecadal climate variations in
New Zealand, identified in the temperature signal by Folland and
Salinger (1995), are related to a SST pattern like the IPO. The IPO
is a significant source of decadal climate variation throughout the
South  Pacific, and  modulates  ENSO  climate  variability  in  this
region (Salinger et al., 2001). Similarly, the PDO (and likely the
IPO) may play a key role in modulating ENSO teleconnections
across  North  America  on  inter-decadal  time-scales  (Gershunov
and Barnett, 1998; Livezey and Smith, 1999). 

A  simple  and  robust  index  of  climate  variability  over  the
North Pacific is the area-weighted mean SLP, averaged over most
of the extra-tropical North Pacific Ocean, of Trenberth and Hurrell

152

Observed Climate Variability and Change

(1994). A  general  reduction  in  SLP  after  about  1976  has  been
particularly evident during the winter half (November to March)
of  many  of  these  years. This  is  characterised  by  a  deeper-than-
normal Aleutian low pressure system, accompanied by stronger-
than-normal westerly winds across the central North Pacific and
enhanced southerly to south-westerly flow along the west coast of
North  America, as  reviewed  in  the  SAR  (Figure  3.17).
Consequently, there have been increases in surface air temperature
and  SST  over  much  of  western  North America  and  the  eastern
North Pacific, respectively, over the past two decades, especially
in  winter, but  decreases  in  SST, or  only  modest  warming, over
parts  of  the  central  extra-tropical  North  Pacific  (Figure  2.10).
Numerous studies have suggested that the mid-1970s changes in
the atmospheric and oceanic circulation may reflect one or more
low-frequency  variations  over  the  North  Pacific, one  being  the
PDO (Kawamura, 1994; Latif and Barnett, 1994; Mann and Park,
1994, 1996;  Deser  and  Blackmon  1995;  Zhang  et  al., 1997b;
White and Cayan, 1998; Enfield and Mestas-Nuñez, 1999).

2.6.4  Monsoons

Variations  in  the  behaviour  of  the  North  African  summer
monsoon  were  highlighted  in  IPCC  (1990).  Moron  (1997)
demonstrated that long-term variations of Sahel annual rainfall,
particularly the wet 1950s and the dry 1970 to 1980s, are seen
over the Guinea coast area, although trends are strongest in the
Sahel. The significant decrease in Guinea coast rainfall (Ward,
1998) is present in both the first and second rainy seasons, but is
strongest in the second. Janicot et al. (1996) and Moron (1997)
demonstrated  that  the  moderate  influence  of  ENSO  (towards
drier  conditions)  has  increased  since  1960, with  warm  events
associated  more  strongly  with  large-scale  anomalous  dry
conditions over the Guinea and Sahel belts. Ward et al. (1999)
show that the Sahel has become moderately wetter since 1987,
despite the increased drying influence of ENSO events, a trend
that continued to 1999 (Parker and Horton, 2000). This recent
behaviour  may  be  related  to  a  quasi-hemispheric  variation  of
SST (e.g., Enfield and Mestas-Nuñez, 1999) shown to be related
to  Sahel  rainfall  by  Folland  et  al.  (1986), and  which  may  be
related  to  the  recent  strong  increase  in  North  Atlantic  SST
mentioned in Section 2.2.2.2. Many other parts of tropical Africa
are  influenced  by  ENSO  towards  either  drier  or  wetter
conditions than normal, sometimes modulated by regional SST
anomalies  near  Africa  (e.g., Nicholson  and  Kim, 1997;
Nicholson, 1997;  Indeje  et  al., 2000), but  few  trends  can  be
discerned. 

Multi-decadal and decadal variations of the Indian monsoon
have been widely noted (e.g., Pant and Kumar, 1997) but links
with  El  Niño  do  not  now  seem  straightforward  (Slingo  et  al.,
1999). However, despite the recent strong El Niño episodes, the
inverse relationship between the ENSO and the Indian summer
monsoon  (weak  monsoon  arising  from  an  ENSO  event)  has
broken down in the recent two decades (Kumar et al., 1999a).
This  link  operated  on  multi-decadal  time-scales  with  NINO  3
SST  until  at  least  1970.  Kumar  et  al. suggest  that  persistently
increased surface temperatures over Eurasia in winter and spring
(Figure  2.10)  have  favoured  an  enhanced  land-ocean  thermal

gradient  conducive  to  stronger  monsoons;  they  also  observe  a
shift away from India in the sinking node of the Walker circula-
tion in El Niño. Changes have also occurred in relationships with
Indian  monsoon  precursors  (Kumar  et  al., 1999b).  One
possibility is that warming over the Indian Ocean (Figures 2.9,
2.10) may have increased moisture and rainfall for a given state
of the atmospheric circulation (Kitoh et al., 1997). There may be
a link to multi-decadal variations in Pacific SST, but this remains
to  be  investigated, together  with  other  monsoon  indices  (e.g.,
Goswami et al., 1997). 

It  has  been  known  for  some  time  that  the  position  of  the
western  North  Pacific  sub-tropical  high  affects  the  East Asian
monsoon. Gong and Wang (1999a) showed that summer (June to
August) precipitation over central and eastern China near 30°N
is  positively  correlated  with  the  intensity  of  the  high, with
negative  correlations  to  the  north  and  south. A  location  of  the
sub-tropical  high  further  south  than  normal  is  conducive  to
heavy  summer  rainfall  in  this  region.  Time-series  of  the  sub-
tropical high show an increase in areal extent in the 1920s, then
another  increase  from  the  mid-1970s  to  1998, giving  frequent
wet summers in this region in recent years. The north-east winter
monsoon  has  also  shown  low-frequency  variations.  Thus  the
strength of the Siberian high increased to a peak around 1968,
and  then  weakened  to  a  minimum  around  1990  (Gong  and
Wang, 1999b), in  phase  with  the  increased  frequency  of  the
positive  phase  of  the  NAO  (Wallace, 2000  and  next  section).
This  is  likely  to  have  contributed  to  strong  recent  winter
warming in China shown in Figure 2.10. 

2.6.5  The Northern Hemisphere excluding the North Pacific 

Ocean 

The atmospheric circulation over the Northern Hemisphere has
exhibited anomalous behaviour over the past several decades. In
particular, the  dominant  patterns  of  atmospheric  variability  in
the  winter  half-year  have  tended  to  be  strongly  biased  to  one
phase. Thus SLP has been lower than average over the mid- and
high latitudes of the North Atlantic Ocean, as well as over much
of the Arctic, while it has been higher than average over the sub-
tropical  oceans, especially  the Atlantic.  Moreover, in  the  past
thirty  years, changes  in  these  leading  patterns  of  natural
atmospheric variability appear to be unusual in the context of the
observational record. 

The dominant pattern of atmospheric circulation variability
over the North Atlantic is known as the NAO, and its wintertime
index is shown in Figure 2.30 (updated from Hurrell, 1995). As
discussed in the SAR, positive values of the NAO give stronger
than  average  westerlies  over  the  mid-latitudes  of  the  Atlantic
with low SLP anomalies in the Icelandic region and over much
of  the Arctic  and  high  SLP  anomalies  across  the  sub-tropical
Atlantic  and  into  southern  Europe.  The  positive, enhanced
westerly, phase of the NAO is associated with cold winters over
the north-west Atlantic and warm winters over Europe, Siberia
and eastern Asia (Thompson and Wallace, 2001) as well as wet
conditions  from  Iceland  to  Scandinavia  and  dry  winters  over
southern Europe. A sharp reversal is evident in the NAO index
starting around 1970 from a negative towards a positive phase.

Figure 2.30: December to March North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
indices, 1864 to 2000, and Arctic Oscillation (AO) indices, 1900 to
2000, updated from Hurrell (1995) and updated from Thompson and
Wallace (2000) and Thompson et al. (2000b), respectively. The indices
were normalised using the means and standard deviations from their
common period, 1900 to 2000, smoothed twice using a 21-point
binomial filter where indicated and then plotted according to the years
of their Januarys.

Since about 1985, the NAO has tended to remain in a strong
positive phase, though with substantial interannual variability.
Hurrell (1996) and Thompson  et  al. (2000a) showed that the
recent  upward  trend  in  the  NAO  accounts  for  much  of  the
regional surface winter half-year warming over northern Europe
and Asia north of about 40oN over the past thirty years, as well
as the cooling over the north-west Atlantic (see Section 2.2.2.3).
Moreover, when circulation changes over the North Pacific are
also considered, much of the pattern of the Northern Hemisphere
winter  half-year  surface  temperature  changes  since  the  mid-
1970s can be explained. This can be associated with changes in
the NAO, and in the PNA atmospheric pattern related to ENSO
or the PDO (Graf et al., 1995; Wallace et al., 1995; Shabbar et
al., 1997; Thompson and Wallace, 1998, 2000). 

The changes in atmospheric circulation over the Atlantic
are  also  connected  with  much  of  the  observed  pressure  fall
over  the  Arctic  in  recent  years  (Walsh  et  al., 1996).  Other
features related to the circulation changes include the strength-
ening  of  sub-polar  westerlies  from  the  surface  of  the  North
Atlantic  up, in  winter  as  high  as  the  lower  stratosphere
(Thompson et al., 2000a) and pronounced regional changes in
precipitation patterns (Hurrell, 1995; Dai et al., 1997b; Hurrell
and van Loon 1997; Section 2.5.2.1). Associated precipitation
increases  have  resulted  in  the  notable  advance  of  some
Scandinavian glaciers (Hagen et al., 1995), while decreases to
the south of about 50oN have contributed to the further retreat
of Alpine glaciers (Frank, 1997; see also Section 2.2.5.3)

The  NAO  is  regarded  (largely)  by  some  as  the  regional
expression  of  a  zonally  symmetrical  hemispheric  mode  of
variability  characterised  by  a  seesaw  of  atmospheric  mass
between the polar cap and the mid-latitudes in both the Atlantic

and  Pacific  Ocean  basins  (Thompson  and  Wallace, 1998,
2001). This mode has been named the AO (Figure 2.30). The
time-series of the NAO and AO are quite similar: the correla-
tion of monthly anomalies of station data SLP series of NAO
and AO is about 0.7 (depending on their exact definitions and
epochs) while seasonal variations shown in Figure 2.30 have
even higher correlations. The NAO and AO can be viewed as
manifestations of the same basic phenomenon (Wallace, 2000). 
Changes  and  decadal  fluctuations  in  sea-ice  cover  in  the
Labrador  and  Greenland  Seas, as  well  as  over  the  Arctic,
appear  well  correlated  with  the  NAO  (Chapman  and  Walsh,
1993; Maslanik et al., 1996; McPhee et al., 1998; Mysak and
Venegas, 1998; Parkinson et al., 1999; Deser et al., 2000). The
relationship between the SLP and ice anomaly fields is consis-
tent with the idea that atmospheric circulation anomalies force
the  sea-ice  variations  (Prisenberg  et  al., 1997).  Feedbacks  or
other  influences  of  winter  ice  anomalies  on  the  atmosphere
have been more difficult to detect, although Deser et al. (2000)
suggest that a local response of the atmospheric circulation to
the reduced sea-ice cover east of Greenland in recent years is
also apparent (see also Section 2.2.5.2).

A number of studies have placed the recent positive values
of the NAO into a longer-term perspective (Jones et al., 1997a;
Appenzeller et al., 1998; Cook et al., 1998; Luterbacher et al.,
1999;  Osborn  et  al., 1999)  back  to  the  1700s.  The  recent
strength of the positive phase of the NAO seems unusual from
these reconstructions but, as in Figure 2.28, these proxy data
reconstructions  may  underestimate  variability.  An  extended
positive phase occurred in the early 20th century (Figure 2.30),
particularly pronounced in January (Parker and Folland, 1988),
comparable  in  length  to  the  recent  positive  phase.  Higher-
frequency variability of the NAO also appears to have varied.
Hurrell and van Loon (1997) showed that quasi-decadal (6 to
10  year)  variability  has  become  more  pronounced  over  the
latter half of the 20th century, while quasi-biennial variability
dominated in the early instrumental record. 

2.6.6  The Southern Hemisphere 

Since  the  SAR  there  has  been  more  emphasis  on  analysis  of
decadal variability over the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern
Hemisphere gridded SLP data for the period 1950 to 1994 show
two dominant modes in annual average values, similar to those
identified  by  Karoly  et  al. (1996)  using  station  data. The  first
mode  unambiguously  represents  the  Southern  Oscillation  and
reflects the tendency towards more frequent and intense negative
phases  over  the  past  several  decades.  The  second  mode
represents anomalies throughout the mid-latitude regions across
the  Indian  Ocean  and  western  Pacific, which  contrast  with
anomalies elsewhere. 

The Trans-Polar Index (TPI) is the only large-scale station
pressure-based  extra-tropical  Southern  Hemisphere  circulation
index  in  regular  use.  It  is  based  on  the  normalised  pressure
difference  between  New  Zealand  and  South America  and  has
been  recalculated  and  extended  by  Jones  et  al. (1999b).  On
decadal and longer time-scales the TPI reflects movement in the
phase  of  wave  number  one  around  the  Southern  Hemisphere.

154

Observed Climate Variability and Change

Troughing (low pressure) was more frequent in the New Zealand
region  in  the  1920s, and  at  a  maximum  in  the  1940s.
Anticyclonicity was favoured from the late 1950s to 1976, with
troughing  in  the  South American  sector.  Troughing  was  again
apparent in the New Zealand sector in the 1990s (Salinger et al.,
1996). 

A leading mode of variability in the extra-tropical Southern
Hemisphere  circulation  on  interannual  to  multi-decadal  time-
scales  is  a  zonally  elongated  north-south  dipole  structure  over
the Pacific, stretching from the sub-tropics to the Antarctic coast
(Mo and Higgins, 1998; Kidson, 1999; Kiladis and Mo, 1999).
It is strongly related to ENSO variability. The lower-frequency
dipole structure contributes to variability in blocking frequency
across  the  far  south  Pacific  (Renwick, 1998;  Renwick  and
Revell, 1999). 

ENSO variability is also implicated in the modulation of a
“High  Latitude  Mode” (HLM) (Kidson, 1988;  Karoly, 1990),
especially over the austral summer. The HLM is now also called
the “Antarctic Oscillation” (AAO); they appear to be the same
phenomenon with the same structure (Thompson and Wallace,
2000). The AAO is a zonal pressure fluctuation between mid-
and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, centred on 55 to
60°S.  It  has  recently  been  further  studied  (Gong  and  Wang,
1999c;  Kidson, 1999;  Thompson  and  Wallace, 2001;  Figure
2.31) and shown to extend into the lower stratosphere between
the  Antarctic  and  the  sub-tropical  latitudes  of  the  Southern
Hemisphere. The AAO appears to persist all year but may be
most  active  from  mid-October  to  mid-December  when  it
extends into the stratosphere (Thompson and Wallace, 2001). In
its high index phase, it consists of low pressure or heights above
the Antarctic  and  the  near  Southern  Ocean  with  high  heights
north  of  about  50oS.  Although  the  data  are  sparse, there  is
evidence that, like the NAO, the AAO has tended to move more
towards a positive index phase, despite lower pressures being
observed over the New Zealand region during the 1990s. This
change is also associated with with increasing westerly winds
in mid-latitudes. Thompson and Wallace (2001) show that most
of  Antarctica  is  rather  cold  in  this  phase, except  for  the
Antarctic Peninsula which is warm due to additional advection
of relatively warm air from seas to the west. This may explain
some of the behaviour of Antarctic temperatures in the last two
decades (Figure 2.10; Comiso, 2000). 

Other  work  has  identified  the  likely  existence  of  an
Antarctic  Circumpolar  Wave  (ACW)  (Jacobs  and  Mitchell,
1996; White and Peterson, 1996), a multi-annual climate signal
in  the  Southern  Ocean, with  co-varying  and  perhaps  coupled
SST and SLP anomalies that move around the Southern Ocean.
Its long-term variability is not yet known. 

2.6.7  Summary

The  interannual  variability  of  ENSO  has  fluctuated  substan-
tially  over  the  last  century, with  notably  reduced  variability
during  the  period  1920  to  1960, compared  with  adjacent
periods.  It  remains  unclear  whether  global  warming  has
influenced  the  shift  towards  less  frequent  La  Niña  episodes
from 1976 to 1998, including the abnormally protracted ENSO

global  warming  pattern  may  have  increased  the  background
temperature in the region most affected by ENSO, but there is
some ambiguity in the details of this pattern. 

Since the SAR, ‘ENSO-like’ features operating on decadal
to multi-decadal time-scales have been identified, such as the
PDO and IPO. They appear to be part of a continuous spectrum
of ENSO variability that has subtly changing SST patterns as
time-scales increase and which may have distinctive effects on
regional climate around the Pacific basin. For the period since
1900, El  Niño  (La  Niña)  events  are  more  prevalent  during
positive (negative) phases of the IPO. 

In the Northern Hemisphere, pronounced changes in winter
atmospheric and oceanic circulations over the North Pacific in
the 1970s (the North Pacific Oscillation) have been paralleled
by  wintertime  circulation  changes  over  the  North  Atlantic,
recorded by the NAO. In the North Pacific, spatially coherent
changes have occurred in surface temperature across the North
Pacific  and  western  North  America, while  the  enhanced
westerly phase of the NAO has caused considerable winter half-
year temperature and precipitation changes over a vast area of
extra-tropical  Eurasia.  In  the  Southern  Hemisphere, a  feature
quite like the NAO, the HLM or the AAO, also appears to have
moved into an enhanced westerly phase in middle latitudes.

2.7  Has Climate Variability, or have Climate Extremes, 

Changed?

2.7.1  Background 

Changes  in  climate  variability  and  extremes  of  weather  and
climate events have received increased attention in the last few
years.  Understanding  changes  in  climate  variability  and
climate extremes is made difficult by interactions between the
changes in the mean and variability (Meehl et al., 2000). Such
interactions vary from variable to variable depending on their
statistical  distribution.  For  example, the  distribution  of
temperatures  often  resembles  a  normal  distribution  where
non-stationarity  of  the  distribution  implies  changes  in  the
mean  or  variance.  In  such  a  distribution, an  increase  in  the

bution of temperature.

mean  leads  to  new  record  high  temperatures  (Figure  2.32a),
but  a  change  in  the  mean  does  not  imply  any  change  in
variability.  For  example, in  Figure  2.32a, the  range  between
the  hottest  and  coldest  temperatures  does  not  change.  An
increase in variability without a change in the mean implies an
increase  in  the  probability  of  both  hot  and  cold  extremes  as
well  as  the  absolute  value  of  the  extremes  (Figure  2.32b).
Increases in both the mean and the variability are also possible
(Figure 2.32c), which affects (in this example) the probability
of hot and cold extremes, with more frequent hot events with
more extreme high temperatures and fewer cold events. Other
combinations of changes in both mean and variability would
lead to different results.

Consequently, even  when  changes  in  extremes  can  be
documented, unless a specific analysis has been completed, it
is often uncertain whether the changes are caused by a change
in the mean, variance, or both. In addition, uncertainties in the
rate of change of the mean confound interpretation of changes
in  variance  since  all  variance  statistics  are  dependent  on  a
reference level, i.e., the mean. 

For  variables  that  are  not  well  approximated  by  normal
distributions, like  precipitation, the  situation  is  even  more
complex, especially  for  dry  climates.  For  precipitation, for
example, changes  in  the  mean  total  precipitation  can  be
accompanied by other changes like the frequency of precipi-
tation or the shape of the distribution including its variability.
All these changes can affect the various aspects of precipita-
tion extremes including the intensity of precipitation (amount
per unit time). 

This  section  considers  the  changes  in  variability  and
extremes  simultaneously  for  two  variables, temperature  and
precipitation.  We  include  new  analyses  and  additional  data
compiled since the SAR which provide new insights. We also
assess new information related to changes in extreme weather
and  climate  phenomena, e.g., tropical  cyclones, tornadoes,
etc.  In  these  analyses, the  primary  focus  is  on  assessing  the
stationarity  (e.g., the  null  hypothesis  of  no  change)  of  these
events, given numerous inhomogeneities in monitoring. 

2.7.2  Is There Evidence for Changes in Variability or 

Extremes?

The  issues  involved  in  measuring  and  assessing  changes  in
extremes  have  recently  been  comprehensively  reviewed  by
Trenberth and Owen (1999), Nicholls and Murray (1999), and
Folland  et  al.  (1999b).  Despite  some  progress  described
below, there  remains  a  lack  of  accessible  daily  climate  data
sets which can be intercompared over large regions (Folland et
al., 2000).  Extremes  are  a  key  aspect  of  climate  change.
Changes  in  the  frequency  of  many  extremes  (increases  or
decreases)  can  be  surprisingly  large  for  seemingly  modest
mean changes in climate (Katz, 1999) and are often the most
sensitive aspects of climate change for ecosystem and societal
responses.  Moreover, changes  in  extremes  are  often  most
sensitive  to  inhomogeneous  climate  monitoring  practices,
making assessment of change more difficult than assessing the
change in the mean.

Observed Climate Variability and Change

2.7.2.1  Temperature
Given the number of ways in which extreme climate events and
variability  about  the  mean  can  be  defined, (e.g., extreme  daily
temperatures, large  areas  experiencing  unusual  temperatures,
severity  of  heat  waves, number  of  frosts  or  freezes, changes  in
interannual  variability  of  large  area  temperatures, etc.)  extreme
care must be exercised in generalising results. Here we assess the
evidence for changes in temperature extremes or variability, first
based  on  global  analyses  and  then  on  more  detailed  regional
analyses. 

Parker et al. (1994) compared the interannual variability of
seasonal temperature anomalies from the 1954 to 1973 period to
the 1974 to 1993 period for most of the globe. They found a small
increase in variability overall with an especially large increase in
central North America. By restricting the analyses to the latter half
of the 20th century, Parker et al. (1994) minimised the potential
biases due to an increasing number of observations in this period.
Several  other  studies  found  a  reduction  in  other  aspects  of
variability over longer time periods. Jones (1999) also analysed
global data and found no change in variability, but since 1951 the
rise in global mean temperatures can be attributed to an increase
(decrease)  in  areas  with  much  above  (below)  normal  tempera-
tures. They  also  analysed  the  change  in  the  aggregated  total  of
much  below  and  much  above  normal  temperatures  (upper  and
lower ten percentiles). They found little overall change, except for
a reduced number of much above or below normal temperatures
during the 1960s and 1970s. Michaels et al. (1998) examined 5°
latitude × 5° longitude monthly temperature anomalies for many
grid cells around the world and found an overall decrease in intra-
annual variance over the past 50 to 100 years. They also examined
the daily maximum and minimum temperatures from the United
States, China, and the former Soviet Union and found a general
decline in the intra-monthly temperature variability. As reported in
the SAR, a related analysis by Karl et al. (1995b) found reduced
day-to-day  variability  during  the  20th  century  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere, particularly in the United States and China. Recently,
Collins et al. (2000) has identified similar trends in Australia. By
analysing  a  long  homogenised  daily  temperature  index  for  four
stations in Northern Europe, Moberg et al. (2000) also found a
progressive reduction in all-seasons inter-daily variability of about
7%  between  1880  and  1998.  Balling  (1998)  found  an  overall
decrease  in  the  spatial  variance  of  both  satellite-based  lower-
tropospheric measurements from 1979 to 1996 and in near-surface
air temperatures from 1897 to 1996. 

Consequently, there is now little evidence to suggest that the
interannual variability of global temperatures has increased over
the past few decades, but there is some evidence to suggest that the
variability of intra-annual temperatures has actually quite widely
decreased. Several analyses find a decrease in spatial and temporal
variability of temperatures on these shorter time-scales. 

There have been a number of new regional studies related to
changes in extreme temperature events during the 20th century.
Gruza et al. (1999) found statistically significant increases in the
number  of  days  with  extreme  high  temperatures  across  Russia
using  data  back  to  1961  and  on  a  monthly  basis  back  to  1900.
Frich et al. (2001) analysed data spanning the last half of the 20th
century across most of the Northern Hemisphere mid- and high

latitudes and found a statistically significant increase (5 to >15%)
in the growing season length in many regions. Heino et al. (1999)
also found that there has been a reduction in the number of days
with frost (the number of days with minimum temperature ≤0°C)
in northern and central Europe. Thus, some stations now have as
many as 50 fewer days of frost per year compared with earlier in
the 20th century. Easterling et al. (2000) found there has been a
significant decrease in the number of days below freezing over the
central United States (about seven per year). For Canada, Bonsal
et al. (2001) also found fewer days with extreme low temperatures
during winter, spring and summer, and more days with extreme
high  temperatures  during  winter  and  spring.  This  has  led  to  a
significant increase in the frost-free period. Decreasing numbers
of days with freezing temperatures have been found in Australia
and  New  Zealand  over  recent  decades  (Plummer  et  al., 1999;
Collins et al., 2000). In addition, while increases in the frequency
of warm days have been observed, decreases in the number of cool
nights  have  been  stronger.  Frich  et  al.  (2001)  show  a  reduced
number of days with frost across much of the globe (Figure 2.33)
while Michaels et al. (2000) find that much of the warming during
the 20th century has been during the cold season in the mid- to
high  latitudes, consistent  with  the  reduction  of  extremely  low
temperatures.  Frich  et  al.  (2001)  have  also  found  a  statistically
significant  reduction  in  the  difference  between  the  annual
extremes of daily maximum and minimum temperatures during
the latter half of the 20th century. In China, strong increases in the
absolute  minimum  temperature  have  been  observed, with
decreases  in  the  1-day  seasonal  extreme  maximum  temperature
(Zhai  et  al., 1999a)  since  the  1950s. Wang  and  Gaffen  (2001),
however, for a similar period, found an increase in “hot” days in
China.  Hot  days  were  defined  as  those  days  above  the  85th
percentile during July and August based on an “apparent temper-
ature” index  related  to  human  discomfort  in  China  (Steadman,
1984). The number of extremely cold days has also been shown to
be decreasing in China (Zhai et al., 1999a). Manton et al. (2001)
found  significant  increases  in  hot  days  and  warm  nights, and
decreases  in  cool  days  and  cold  nights  since  1961  across  the
Southeast Asia  and  South  Pacific  Region.  Jones  et  al.  (1999c)
have  analysed  the  230-year-long  daily  central  England  data  set
that has been adjusted for observing inhomogeneities. They found
that  the  increase  in  temperature  observed  in  central  England
corresponds mainly to a reduction in the frequency of much below
normal daily temperatures. An increase of the frequency of much
above normal temperatures was less apparent. 

Analyses of 20th century trends in the United States of short-
duration episodes (a few days) of extreme hot or cold weather did
not  show  any  significant  changes  in  frequency  or  intensity
(Kunkel et al., 1996, 1999; Karl and Knight, 1997). For Australia,
Collins et al. (2000) found higher frequencies of multi-day warm
nights and days, and decreases in the frequency of cool days and
nights. In an extensive assessment of the change in frequency of
heat waves during the latter half of the 20th century, Frich et al.
(2001) find some evidence for an increase in heat-wave frequency,
but  several  regions  have  opposite  trends  (Figure  2.33c).  The
extreme heat in the United States during several years in the 1930s
dominates  the  time-series  of  heat  waves  in  that  region.  On  the
other hand, trends in the frequency of extreme apparent tempera-

tures  are  significantly  larger  for  1949  to  1995  during  summer
over  most  of  the  USA  (Gaffen  and  Ross, 1998). Warm  humid
nights more than doubled in number over 1949 to 1995 at some
locations. Trends in nocturnal apparent temperature in the USA,
however, are  likely  to  be  associated, in  part, with  increased
urbanisation.  Nevertheless, using  methods  and  data  sets  to
minimise  urban  heat  island  effects  and  instrument  changes,
Easterling et al. (2000) arrived at conclusions similar to those of
Gaffen and Ross (1998).

During  the  1997/98  El  Niño  event, global  temperature
records  were  broken  for  sixteen  consecutive  months  from  May
1997 through to August 1998. Karl et al. (2000) describe this as
an unusual event and such a monthly sequence is unprecedented
in the observational record. More recently, Wigley (2000) argues
that if it were not for the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, an approxi-
mately equal number of record-breaking temperatures would have
been set during the El Niño of 1990/91. As temperatures continue
to  warm, more  events  like  these  are  likely, especially  when
enhanced by other factors, such as El Niño.

2.7.2.2  Precipitation
A  better  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  changes  in
total  precipitation  and  intense  precipitation  events  has  been
achieved since the SAR. Although many areas of the globe have
not  been  analysed, and  considerable  data  remain  inaccessible,
enough data have been analysed to confirm some basic properties
of the changes in extreme precipitation. Groisman et al. (1999)
developed  a  simple  statistical  model  of  the  frequency  of  daily
precipitation based on the gamma distribution. They applied this
model to a variety of regions around the world (40% of the global
land area) during the season of greatest precipitation. Although
Wilks  (1999)  shows  that  the  gamma  distribution  under  some
circumstances  can  underestimate  the  probability  of  the  highest
rainfall amounts, Groisman et al. (1999) applied the distribution
to the upper 5 and 10 percentiles of the distribution which are less
subject  to  underestimation.  Their  analysis  period  varied  from
region to region, but within each region it generally spanned at
least the last several decades, and for some regions much of the
20th  century  (Australia, United  States, Norway, and  South

Change in the frequency of daily rainfall
Figure 2.34: An example (from Groisman et al., 1999) of the
sensitivity of the frequency of heavy daily rainfall to a shift in the
mean total rainfall, based on station data from Guangzhou, China. This
example uses a threshold of 50 mm of precipitation per day. It shows
the effects of a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in mean total
summer rainfall, based on a gamma distribution of the rainfall with a
constant shape parameter.

Africa). In the model used by Groisman et al. (1999), the mean
total  precipitation  is  also  proportional  to  the  shape  and  scale
parameters of the gamma distribution as well as to the probability
of  precipitation  on  any  given  day.  The  shape  parameter  of  the
gamma  distribution  tends  to  be  relatively  stable  across  a  wide
range of precipitation regimes, in contrast to the scale parameter.
Given the conservative nature of the shape parameter, it is possible
to illustrate the relationships between changes in the mean total
precipitation, the  probability  of  precipitation  (which  is  propor-
tional to the number of days with precipitation), and changes in
heavy  precipitation  (Figure  2.34).  Given  no  change  in  the
frequency (number of days) of precipitation, a 10% change in the
mean total precipitation is amplified to a larger percentage change
in heavy precipitation rates compared to the change in the mean.
Using  the  statistical  theory  of  extremes, Katz  (1999)  obtained
results consistent with those of Groisman et al. (1999). For many
regions of the world it appears that the changes in the frequency
or probability of precipitation events are either small enough, or
well enough expressed in the high rainfall rates (Karl and Knight,
1998;  Gruza  et  al., 1999;  Haylock  and  Nicholls, 2000)  that  an
increase  in  the  mean  total  precipitation  is  disproportionately
reflected in increased heavy precipitation rates (Figure 2.35).

Given  the  patterns  of  mean  total  precipitation  changes
(Section  2.5.2)  during  the  20th  century, it  could  be  anticipated
that, in general, for those areas with increased mean total precip-
itation, the  percentage  increase  in  heavy  precipitation  rates
should be significantly larger, and vice versa for total precipita-
tion decreases. Regional analyses of annual precipitation in the
United States (Karl and Knight, 1998; Trenberth, 1998a; Kunkel
et al., 1999); Canada (Stone et al., 1999); Switzerland (Frei and
Schär, 2001); Japan ( Iwashima and Yamamoto, 1993; Yamamoto
and Sakurai, 1999); wintertime precipitation in the UK (Osborn
et  al., 2000);  and  rainy  season  precipitation  in  Norway, South

Figure 2.35: Linear trends (%/decade) of heavy precipitation (above
the 90th percentile) and total precipitation during the rainy season over
various regions of the globe. Seasons for each region usually span at
least 50 years. Note that the magnitudes of the changes in heavy
precipitation frequencies are always higher than changes in mean
precipitation totals (Easterling et al., 2000).

Africa, the Nord Este of Brazil, and the former USSR (Groisman
et al., 1999; Gruza et al., 1999; Easterling et al., 2000) confirm
this  characteristic  of  an  amplified  response  for  the  heavy  and
extreme events. 

Increases in heavy precipitation have also been documented
even when mean total precipitation decreases (for example, see
Northern Japan in Figure 2.35, or Manton et al., 2001). This can
occur  when  the  probability  of  precipitation  (the  number  of
events) decreases, or if the shape of the precipitation distribution
changes, but  this  latter  situation  is  less  likely  (Buffoni  et  al.,
1999;  Groisman  et  al., 1999;  Brunetti  et  al., 2000a,b).  For
example, in Siberia for the summer season during the years 1936
to  1994  there  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  total
precipitation  of  1.3%/decade, but  the  number  of  days  with
precipitation  also  decreased.  This  resulted  in  an  increase
(1.9%/decade) in the frequency of heavy rainfall above 25 mm.
The opposite can also occur when the number of rainfall events
increases;  thus  Førland  et  al.  (1998)  found  no  trends  in  1-day
annual  maximum  precipitation  in  the  Nordic  countries, even
when mean total precipitation increased. 

There has also been a 10 to 45% increase in heavy rainfall,
as  defined  by  the  99th  percentile  of  daily  totals, over  many
regions of Australia from 1910 to 1995, but few individual trends
were  statistically  significant  (Hennessy  et  al., 1999).  In  south-
west Australia, however, a  15%  decrease  has  been  observed  in
winter rainfall on very wet days (Hennessy et al., 1999; Haylock
and Nicholls, 2000).

In Niger, a recent analysis of hourly rainfall data (Shinoda et
al., 1999) reveals that the droughts in the 1970s and 1980s were
characterised primarily by a reduced frequency of heavy rainfall
events (those exceeding 30 mm/day) rather than by a reduction in
rainfall amount within heavy events. Such a result is still consis-
tent with the model of Groisman et al. (1999), as a decrease in the

Figure 2.36: Changes in the maximum annual 5-day precipitation total (a, b) and in the proportion of annual precipitation occurring on days on
which the 95th percentile of daily precipitation, defined over the period 1961 to 1990, was exceeded (c, d). The analysis shown is from Frich et al.
(2001). Panels (a) and (c) show percentage changes in these quantities between the first and last half of the period, approximately 1946 to 1999. In
both panels, the red circles indicate negative changes and the blue circles indicate positive changes. The size of each circle reflects the size of the
change and solid circles represent statistically significant changes. Panels (b) and (d) show the average annual values of the quantities expressed as
percentage differences from their 1961 to 1990 average values. The trend shown in panel (b) is statistically significant at the 5% level. 

frequency of rainfall events has been responsible for the decrease
in total rainfall. In the Sahel region of Nigeria, however, there has
been  a  decrease  in  the  heaviest  daily  precipitation  amounts,
coincident  with  an  overall  decrease  in  annual  rainfall.  This
pattern is apparent throughout the Sudano-Sahel Zone, including
the Ethiopian plateau (Nicholson, 1993; Tarhule and Woo, 1998;
Easterling et al., 2000). Again, it is apparent that there has been
an amplified response of the heaviest precipitation rates relative
to the percentage change in total precipitation. 

Since large portions of the mid- and high latitude land areas
have  had  increasing  precipitation  during  the  last  half  the  20th
century, the question arises as to how much of this area is affected
by increases in heavy and extreme precipitation rates. The Frich et
al. (2001) analysis suggests an overall increase in the area affected
by  more  intense  daily  rainfall.  Figure  2.36  shows  that  widely
distributed parts of the mid- and high latitudes have locally statis-
tically significant increases in both the proportion of mean annual
total precipitation falling into the upper five percentiles and in the
annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation total. However,
for the regions of the globe sampled taken as a whole, only the
latter statistic shows a significant increase. Regional analyses in

Russia (Gruza et al., 1999), the United States (Karl and Knight,
1998)  and  elsewhere  (Groisman  et  al., 1999;  Easterling  et  al.,
2000)  confirm  this  trend. Although  the  trends  are  by  no  means
uniform, as would be anticipated with the relatively high spatial
and  interannual  variability  of  precipitation, about  10%  of  the
stations analysed show statistically significant increases at the 5%
level. This equates to about a 4% increase in the annual maximum
5-day precipitation total (Figure 2.36b). The number of stations
reflecting a locally significant increase in the proportion of total
annual  precipitation  occurring  in  the  upper  five  percentiles  of
daily  precipitation  totals  outweighs  the  number  of  stations  with
significantly decreasing trends by more than 3 to 1 (Figure 2.36c).
Although  not  statistically  significant  when  averaging  over  all
stations, there is about a 1% increase in the proportion of daily
precipitation events occurring in the upper five percentiles (Figure
2.36d). Overall, it is likely that there has been a 2 to 4% increase
in the number of heavy precipitation events when averaged across
the mid- and high latitudes. 

It  has  been  noted  that  an  increase  (or  decrease)  in  heavy
precipitation  events  may  not  necessarily  translate  into  annual
peak (or low) river levels. For example, in the United States, Lins

160

Observed Climate Variability and Change

and  Slack  (1999)  could  not  detect  an  increase  in  the  upper
quantiles  of  streamflow, despite  the  documented  increase  in
heavy and extreme precipitation events. It is possible that this null
result is partly due to the method of analysis, but it is also attrib-
utable  to  the  timing  of  the  annual  peak  streamflow  discharge,
which in the United States is usually in late winter or early spring.
A reduced snow cover extent in the mountainous West changes
the  peak  river  flow, as  does  timing  of  increases  in  heavy  and
extreme precipitation reported in the United States, which is best
reflected  during  the  warm  season.  Groisman  et  al.  (2001)  and
Zhang et al. (2000) also show reduced peak streamflow in areas
with reduced spring snow cover extent. Nonetheless, in much of
the  United  States  where  spring  snow  melt  does  not  dominate
peak  or  normal  flow, Groisman  et  al.  (2001)  show  increasing
high streamflow related to increasing heavy precipitation. 

It is noteworthy that the influence of warmer temperatures
and increased water vapour in the atmosphere (Section 2.5.3) are
not  independent  events, and  are  likely  to  be  jointly  related  to
increases in heavy and extreme precipitation events. 

2.7.3  Is There Evidence for Changes in Extreme Weather or 

Climate Events?

In this section we assess changes in the intensity and frequency of
various  weather  phenomena.  One  aspect  of  change  that  is
important, but  which  is  beyond  the  analysis  of  present  records,
relates to changes in the tracks of storms. Severe storms are often
rare, so  the  analysis  of  large  areas  and  long  lengths  of  homo-
geneous storm records are required to assess changes. So far this
combination of data is not available.

2.7.3.1  Tropical cyclones
This  section  updates  the  information  provided  in  the  SAR
regarding  changes  in  tropical  cyclones  across  various  ocean
basins and those affecting the nearby continents. As reported in
the SAR, a part of the multi-decadal trend of tropical cyclones
occurring in the Australian region (105° to 160°E) is likely to be
artificial, as the forecasters in the region no longer classify some
weak  (>990  hPa  central  pressure)  systems  as  “cyclones”
(Nicholls  et  al., 1998).  By  considering  only  the  moderate  and
intense tropical cyclones (central pressure ≤990 hPa), this artificial
trend is eliminated. The remaining moderate and strong tropical
cyclones reveal a numerical decline since the late 1980s, but the
trend is not statistically significant. Similarly, the trend in intense
tropical  cyclones  (minimum  central  pressure  below  970  hPa)  is
not significantly different from zero. Nicholls et al. (1998) attrib-
uted  the  decrease  in  moderate  cyclones  to  more  frequent
occurrences of El Niño during the 1980s and 1990s. However, a
weak  trend  in  the  intense  tropical  cyclones  implies  that  while
ENSO  modulates  the  total  frequency  of  cyclones  in  the  region,
other factors must be more important in regulating their intensity.
For example, new work by Higgins and Shi (2000) and Maloney
and  Hartmann  (2001)  show  that  30  to  80  day  Madden-Julian
oscillations modulate tropical cyclone activity. 

As  reported  in  the  SAR, the  north-east  sub-tropical  Pacific
has  experienced  a  significant  upward  trend  in  tropical  cyclone
frequency in the short period examined, but additional data since

that time show no appreciable trend. There is no appreciable long-
term  variation  of  the  total  number  of  tropical  storm  strength
cyclones  observed  in  the  north  Indian, south-west  Indian  and
south-west  Pacific  Oceans  east  of  160°E.  (Neumann, 1993;
Lander and Guard, 1998). For the north-west sub-tropical Pacific
basin, Chan and Shi (1996) found that the frequency of typhoons
and the total number of tropical storms and typhoons have been
more variable since about 1980. There was an increase from 1981
to 1994, which was preceded by a nearly identical magnitude of
decrease from about 1960 to 1980. No analysis has been done on
the  frequency  of  intense  typhoons  (having  winds  of  at  least  50
m/s) due to an overestimation of the intensity of such storms in the
1950s and 1960s (Black, 1993).

There  has  been  an  extensive  analysis  of  the  North Atlantic
basin for the entire basin back to 1944, and also for the United
States landfall tropical storms and hurricanes back to 1899. The
all-basin  data, however, have  been  affected  by  a  bias  in  the
measurement of strong hurricanes. This bias has been removed in
an approximate way to provide estimates of the true occurrence of
intense  (or  major)  hurricanes  since  1944  in  the  North  Atlantic
(Landsea, 1993).  Earlier  events  lack  reliable  data  on  the  strong
inner core of the hurricanes. The United States record of landfall
frequency and intensity of hurricanes is very reliable because of

Observed Climate Variability and Change

161

the  availability  of  central  pressure  measurements  at  landfall
(Jarrell  et  al., 1992).  Both  of  these  data  sets  continue  to  show
considerable inter-decadal variability, but no significant long-term
trends  (Figure  2.37, from  Landsea  et  al., 1999).  Active  years
occurred  from  the  late  1940s  to  the  mid-1960s, quiet  years
occurred from the 1970s to the early 1990s, and then there was a
shift  again  to  active  conditions  from  1995  to  1999.  Concurrent
with  these  frequency  changes, there  have  been  periods  with  a
strong mean intensity of the North Atlantic tropical cyclones (mid-
1940s to the 1960s and 1995 to 1999) and a weak intensity (1970s
to early 1990s). There has been no significant change in the peak
intensity reached by the strongest hurricane each year (Landsea et
al., 1996). As  might  be  anticipated, there  is  a  close  correspon-
dence  between  the  intensity  of  hurricanes  in  the  North Atlantic
and those making landfall in the United States (Figure 2.37).

Using  historical  records, Fernandez-Partagas  and  Diaz
(1996) estimated that overall Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane
activity  for  the  years  1851  to  1890  was  12%  lower  than  the
corresponding forty year period of 1951 to 1990, although little
can  be  said  regarding  the  intense  hurricanes.  They  based  this
assessment  upon  a  constant  ratio  of  USA  landfalling  tropical
cyclones to all-basin activity, which is likely to be valid for multi-
decadal time-scales. However, this also assumes that Fernandez-
Partagas  and  Diaz  were  able  to  uncover  all  USA  landfalling
tropical cyclones back to 1851, which may be more questionable.

2.7.3.2  Extra-tropical cyclones
Extra-tropical cyclones are baroclinic low pressure systems that
occur  throughout  the  mid-latitudes  of  both  hemispheres.  Their
potential  for  causing  property  damage, particularly  as  winter
storms, is well documented, where the main interest is in wind
and  wind-generated  waves.  In  place  of  direct  wind  measure-
ments, which suffer from lack of consistency of instrumentation,
methodology and exposure, values based on SLP gradients have
been  derived  which  are  more  reliable  for  discerning  long-term
changes. Over the oceans, the additional measurements of wave
heights and tide gauge measurements provide additional ways of
indirectly evaluating changes in extra-tropical storm strength and
frequency (see Chapter 11, Section 11.3.3). Global analyses of
changes in extra-tropical storm frequency and intensity have not
been attempted, but there have been several large-scale studies.
Jones et al. (1999c) developed a gale index of geostrophic flow
and  vorticity  over  the  UK  for  the  period  1881  to  1997.  This
revealed an increase in the number of severe gale days over the
UK since the 1960s, but no long-term increase when considering
the century period. Serreze et al. (1997) found increases in cold
season cyclones in the Arctic region for the period 1966 to 1993.
Angel  and  Isard  (1998)  found  significant  increases  in  strong
cyclones (<993 mb) in the Great Lakes region from 1900 to 1990
during the cold season. Graham and Diaz (2001) find evidence
for increases in strong cyclones over the Pacific Ocean between
25 and 40°N since 1948 and link the increase to increasing sea
surface  temperatures  in  the  western  Tropical  Pacific.
Alexandersson  et  al.  (1998, 2000)  similarly  studied  extreme
geostrophic  wind  events  in  the  north-western  European  area
based  on  homogenised  observations  during  the  period  1881  to
1998.  These  studies  revealed  an  increase  in  the  number  of

extreme wind events around and to the north of the North Sea.
The WASA group (1998) similarly investigated the storm related
sea level variations at gauge stations in the south-eastern part of
the North Sea. They found no long-term trend during the last 100
years, but  a  clear  rise  since  a  minimum  of  storminess  in  the
1960s, which is consistent with the rise in extreme geostrophic
wind found by Jones et al. (1999c). This increase is also consis-
tent with changes in the NAO (Figure 2.30). Some analyses have
focused  on  hemispheric  changes  in  cyclone  activity.  Lambert
(1996) analysed gridded SLP over both the North Atlantic and
North Pacific Oceans for the period 1891 to 1991. He found a
significant  increase  in  intense  extra-tropical  storms, especially
over the last two decades of his analysis, but the data were not
completely homogenised. Simmonds and Keay (2000) used data
from  1958  to  1997  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  and  found  an
increase  in  cyclone  activity  through  1972  before  decreasing
through 1997 with strong decreases during the 1990s.

Hourly  values  of  water  levels  provide  a  unique  record  of
tropical and extra-tropical storms where stations exist. Zhang et
al.  (1997a)  have  analysed  century-long  records  along  the  East
Coast  of  the  United  States.  They  calculated  several  different
measures of storm severity, but did not find any long-term trends.
On the other hand, they did find that the effect of sea level rise
over  the  last  century  has  exacerbated  the  beach  erosion  and
flooding from modern storms that would have been less damaging
a century ago.

Another  proxy  for  cyclone  intensity  is  wave  height  (see
Chapter  11, Section  11.3.3).  Several  studies  report  increased
wave  height  over  the  past  three  decades  in  the  North Atlantic
(approximately 2.5 cm/yr) and in coastal areas, though no longer-
term trends were evident (Carter and Draper, 1988; Bacon and
Carter, 1991; Bouws et al., 1996; Kushnir et al., 1997; WASA
Group, 1998).

It appears that recent work points towards increases over time
in extra-tropical cyclone activity during the latter half of the 20th
century in the Northern Hemisphere, and decreased activity in the
Southern Hemisphere. However, the mechanisms involved are not
clear, and  it  is  not  certain  whether  the  trends  are  multi-decadal
fluctuations, or  rather  part  of  a  longer-term  trend.  Furthermore
decreased  cyclone  activity  in  higher  latitudes  of  the  Southern
Hemisphere  is  not  obviously  consistent  with  an  increase  in  the
positive phase of the Antarctic Oscillation in the last fifteen years
or so (Section 2.6.6). A more fundamental question is whether we
would  expect  more  or  fewer  extra-tropical  cyclones  with
increased  warming.  As  pointed  out  by  Simmonds  and  Keay
(2000), the specific humidity increases as temperatures increase,
and  this  increased  moisture  should  enhance  extra-tropical
cyclones, but  Zhang  and  Wang  (1997)  suggest  that  cyclones
transport  energy  more  efficiently  in  a  more  moist  atmosphere,
therefore requiring fewer extra-tropical cyclones (see Chapters 7
and 10 for more discussion).

2.7.3.3  Droughts and wet spells
In  the  SAR, an  intensification  of  the  hydrological  cycle  was
projected  to  occur  as  the  globe  warms.  One  measure  of  such
intensification is to examine whether the frequency of droughts
and wet spells are increasing. Karl et al. (1995c) examined the

162

Observed Climate Variability and Change

proportion  of  land  areas  having  a  severe  drought  and  a  severe
moisture  surplus  over  the  United  States.  Dai  et  al.  (1998)
extended  this  analysis  to  global  land  areas  using  the  water
balance approach of the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Long-
term global trends for 1900 to 1995 are relatively small for both
severe drought and wet area statistics. However, during the last
two  to  three  decades, there  have  been  some  increases  in  the
globally  combined  severe  dry  and  wet  areas, resulting  from
increases in either the dry area, e.g., over the Sahel, eastern Asia
and southern Africa or the wet areas, e.g., over the United States
and Europe. Most of the increases occurred after 1970. Except
for the Sahel, however, the magnitude of dry and wet areas of the
recent  decades  is  not  unprecedented  during  this  century, but  it
should be noted that rainfall in the Sahel since the height of the
drought has substantially increased. In related work, Frich et al.
(2001) found that in much of the mid- and high latitudes, there
has been a statistically significant increase in both the number of
days  with  precipitation  exceeding  10  mm  per  day  and  in  the
number of consecutive days with precipitation during the second
half of the 20th century.

Recent changes in the areas experiencing severe drought or
wet spells are closely related to the shift in ENSO towards more
warm events since the late 1970s, and coincide with record high
global mean temperatures. Dai et al. (1998) found that for a given
value  of  ENSO  intensity, the  response  in  areas  affected  by
drought  or  excessive  wetness  since  the  1970s  is  more  extreme
than prior to the 1970s, also suggesting an intensification of the
hydrological cycle. 

2.7.3.4  Tornadoes, hail and other severe local weather
Small-scale severe weather phenomena (SCSWP) are primarily
characterised  by  quasi-random  temporal  and  spatial  events.
These events, in turn, have local and regional impacts, often with
significant  damage  and  sometimes  loss  of  life.  Tornadoes  and
thunderstorms  and  related  phenomena  such  as  lightning, hail,
wind, dust, water spouts, downpours and cloudbursts belong to
this  group.  In  the  light  of  the  very  strong  spatial  variability  of
SCSWP, the density of surface meteorological observing stations
is too coarse to measure all such events. Moreover, areally consis-
tent  values  of  SCSWP  are  inherently  elusive.  Statistics  of
relatively  rare  events  are  not  stable  at  single  stations, observa-
tional practices can be subjective and change over time, and the
metadata outlining these practices are often not readily available
to researchers. For these reasons, monitoring the occurrence of
local maxima and minima in smoothed SCSWP series, as well as
checking  for  trends  of  the  same  sign  for  different  but  related
SCSWP  (e.g., thunderstorms, hail, cloud  bursts), are  important
for checking inconsistencies. Because of the inherent difficulty in
working  with  these  data, there  have  been  relatively  few  large-
scale  analyses  of  changes  and  variations  in  these  events.
Nonetheless, a few new regional analyses have been completed
since the SAR. 

A  regional  analysis  by  Dessens  (1995)  and  more  recent
global analysis by Reeve and Toumi (1999) show that there is a
significant interannual correlation between hail and lightning and
mean minimum temperature and wet bulb temperatures. Using a
three-year data set, Reeve and Toumi (1999) found a statistically

significant relationship between lightning frequency and wet bulb
temperature. They show that with a 1°C increase in global wet-
bulb  temperature  there  is  a  40%  increase  in  lightning  activity,
with  larger  increases  over  the  Northern  Hemisphere  land  areas
(56%). Unfortunately, there are few long-term data sets that have
been analysed for lightning and related phenomena such as hail
or  thunderstorms, to  calculate  multi-decadal  hemispheric  or
global trends.

A regional analysis assessed the temporal fluctuations and
trends  in  hail-day  and  thunder-day  occurrences  during  a  100-
year  period, from  1896  to  1995, derived  from  carefully
screened  records  of  67  stations  distributed  across  the  United
States. Upward hail day trends were found in the High Plains-
Rockies and the south-east, contrasting with areas with no trend
in  the  northern  Midwest  and  along  the  East  Coast, and  with
downward trends elsewhere (Changnon and Changnon, 2000).
The  major  regions  of  decrease  and  increase  in  hail  activity
match regions of increased and decreased thunder activity for
1901  to  1980  well  (Changnon, 1985;  Gabriel  and  Changnon,
1990)  and  also  crop-hail  insurance  losses  (Changnon  et  al.,
1996;  Changnon  and  Changnon, 1997).  In  general, hail
frequency  shows  a  general  decrease  for  most  of  the  United
States over the last century, with increases over the High Plains,
the  region  where  most  of  the  crop-hail  damage  occurs  in  the
United States. So, despite an increase in minimum temperature
of  more  than  1°C  since  1900  and  an  increase  in  tropospheric
water vapour over the United States since 1973 (when records
are deemed reliable), no systematic increase in hail or thunder
days was found.

In south Moravia, Czech Republic, a decreasing linear trend
in  the  frequency  of  thunderstorms, hailstorms  and  heavy  rain
from  1946  to  1995  was  related  to  a  significant  decrease  in  the
occurrence of these phenomena during cyclonic situations, when
90% of these phenomena occur in that region (Brázdil and Vais,
1997). Temperatures have increased in this area since 1946.

Since  1920, the  number  of  tornadoes  reported  annually  in
the United States has increased by an order of magnitude, but this
increase  reflects  greater  effectiveness  in  collecting  tornado

reports (Doswell and Burgess, 1988; Grazulis, 1993; Grazulis et
al., 1998).  On  the  other  hand, severe  tornadoes  are  not  easily
overlooked.  Restricting  the  analysis  to  very  strong  and  violent
tornadoes  results  in  a  much  different  assessment  (Figure  2.38)
showing  little  long-term  change, though  some  years  like  1974
show a very large number of tornadoes. Furthermore, considera-
tion of the number of days with tornadoes, rather than number of
tornadoes, reduces the artificial changes that result from modern,
more detailed damage surveys (e.g., Doswell and Burgess, 1988).
The data set of “significant” tornado days developed by Grazulis
(1993) shows a slow increase in number of days with significant
tornadoes from the early 1920s through the 1960s, followed by a
decrease since that time. 

2.7.4  Summary

Based on new analyses since the SAR, it is likely that there has
been a widespread increase in heavy and extreme precipitation
events in regions where total precipitation has increased, e.g.,
the  mid-  and  high  latitudes  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere.
Increases in the mean have often been found to be amplified in
the highest precipitation rates total. In some regions, increases
in heavy rainfall have been identified where the total precipita-
tion has decreased or remained constant, such as eastern Asia.
This is attributed to a decrease in the frequency of precipitation.
Fewer  areas  have  been  identified  where  decreases  in  total
annual precipitation have been associated with decreases in the
highest  precipitation  rates, but  some  have  been  found.
Temperature  variability  has  decreased  on  intra-seasonal  and
daily time-scales in limited regional studies. New record high
night-time  minimum  temperatures  are  lengthening  the  freeze
and frost season in many mid- and high latitude regions. The
increase  in  global  temperatures  has  resulted  mainly  from  a
significant  reduction  in  the  frequency  of  much  below  normal
seasonal mean temperatures across much of the globe, with a
corresponding smaller increase in the frequency of much above
normal temperatures. There is little sign of long-term changes
in  tropical  storm  intensity  and  frequency, but  inter-decadal
variations  are  pronounced.  Owing  to  incomplete  data  and
relatively few analyses, we are uncertain as to whether there has
been  any  large-scale, long-term  increase  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere  extra-tropical  cyclone  intensity  and  frequency
though  some, sometimes  strong, multi-decadal  variations  and
recent  increases  were  identified  in  several  regions.  Limited
evidence  exists  for  a  decrease  in  cyclone  frequency  in  the
Southern Hemisphere since the early 1970s, but there has been
a paucity of analyses and data. Recent analyses of changes in
severe  local  weather  (tornadoes, thunder  days, lightning  and
hail) in a few selected regions provide no compelling evidence
for widespread systematic long-term changes. 

various  indicators  of  climate  change  have  increased  our
confidence in our analyses of the historical climate record: Figure
2.39a and b summarises the changes in various temperature and
hydrological indicators, respectively, and provides a measure of
confidence  about  each  change.  Of  particular  relevance  are  the
changes identified below:

• Temperature  over  the  global  land  and  oceans, with  two
estimates for the latter, are measured and adjusted independ-
ently, yet all three show quite consistent increasing trends (0.52
to 0.61°C/century) over the 20th century. 

• The nearly worldwide decrease in mountain glacier extent and
mass  is  consistent  with  20th  century  global  temperature
increases. A few recent exceptions in maritime areas have been
affected  by  atmospheric  circulation  variations  and  related
precipitation increases.

• Though  less  certain, substantial  proxy  evidence  points  to  the
exceptional warmth of the late 20th century relative to the last
1,000  years.  The  1990s  are  likely  to  have  been  the  warmest
decade of the past 1,000 years over the Northern Hemisphere
as a whole.

• Satellite  and  balloon  measurements  agree  that  lower-tropo-
spheric temperatures have increased only slightly since 1979,
though  there  has  been  a  faster  rate  of  global  surface  temp-
erature increase. Balloon measurements indicate a larger lower-
tropospheric  temperature  increase  since  1958, similar  to  that
shown  by  global  surface  temperature  measurements  over  the
same  period.  Balloon  and  satellite  measurements  agree  that
lower-stratospheric  temperatures  have  declined  significantly
since 1979. 

• Since 1979, trends in worldwide land-surface air temperature
derived from weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere, in
regions where urbanisation is likely to have been strong, agree
closely with satellite derived temperature trends in the lower
troposphere above the same regions. This suggests that urban
heat  island  biases  have  not  significantly  affected  surface
temperature over the period.

• The decrease in the continental diurnal temperature range since
around 1950 coincides with increases in cloud amount and, at
least  since  the  mid-1970s  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere,
increases in water vapour. 

• Decreases in spring snow cover extent since the 1960s, and in
the duration of lake and river ice over at least the last century,
relate  well  to  increases  in  Northern  Hemispheric  surface  air
temperatures. 

2.8  Are the Observed Trends Internally Consistent?

It is very important to compare trends in the various indicators to
see  if  a  physically  consistent  picture  emerges, as  this  will
critically affect the final assessment of our confidence in any such
changes.  A  number  of  qualitative  consistencies  among  the

• The systematic decrease in spring and summer Arctic sea-ice
extent in recent decades is broadly consistent with increases of
temperature  over  most  of  the  adjacent  land  and  ocean.  The
large reduction in the thickness of summer and early autumn
Arctic  sea  ice  over  the  last  thirty  to  forty  years  is  consistent

with this decrease in spatial extent, but we are unsure to what
extent  poor  temporal  sampling  and  multi-decadal  variability
are affecting the conclusions.

• The increases in lower-tropospheric water vapour and temper-
ature since the mid-1970s are qualitatively consistent with an
enhanced hydrological cycle. This is in turn consistent with a
greater fraction of precipitation being delivered from extreme
and  heavy  precipitation  events, primarily  in  areas  with
increasing  precipitation, e.g., mid-  and  high  latitudes  of  the
Northern Hemisphere. 

• Where  data  are  available, changes  in  precipitation  generally
correspond  with  consistent  changes  in  streamflow  and  soil
moisture.

We  conclude  that  the  variations  and  trends  of  the  examined
indicators  consistently  and  very  strongly  support  an  increasing
global surface temperature over at least the last century, although
substantial shorter-term global and regional deviations from this
warming trend are very likely to have occurred.

Executive Summary

CO2 concentration trends and budgets

Before the Industrial Era, circa 1750, atmospheric carbon dioxide
(CO2) concentration was 280 ± 10 ppm for several thousand years.
It has risen continuously since then, reaching 367 ppm in 1999. 
The  present  atmospheric  CO2 concentration  has  not  been
exceeded during the past 420,000 years, and likely not during the
past 20 million years. The rate of increase over the past century
is  unprecedented, at  least  during  the  past  20,000  years. 
The present atmospheric CO2 increase is caused by anthro-
pogenic  emissions  of  CO2.  About  three-quarters  of  these
emissions are due to fossil fuel burning. Fossil fuel burning (plus
a  small  contribution  from  cement  production)  released on
average  5.4  ± 0.3  PgC/yr  during  1980  to  1989, and  6.3  ± 0.4
PgC/yr during 1990 to 1999. Land use change is responsible for
the rest of the emissions.

The rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 content was 3.3 ±
0.1 PgC/yr during 1980 to 1989 and 3.2 ± 0.1 PgC/yr during 1990
to 1999. These rates are less than the emissions, because some of
the emitted CO2 dissolves in the oceans, and some is taken up by
terrestrial  ecosystems.  Individual  years  show  different  rates  of
increase. For example, 1992 was low (1.9 PgC/yr), and 1998 was
the  highest  (6.0  PgC/yr)  since  direct  measurements  began  in
1957. This variability is mainly caused by variations in land and
ocean uptake.

Statistically, high rates of increase in atmospheric CO2 have
occurred  in  most  El  Niño  years, although  low  rates  occurred
during the extended El Niño of 1991 to 1994. Surface water CO2
measurements from the equatorial Pacific show that the natural
source of CO2 from this region is reduced by between 0.2 and 1.0
PgC/yr  during  El  Niño  events, counter  to  the  atmospheric
increase. It is likely that the high rates of CO2 increase during
most El Niño events are explained by reductions in land uptake,
caused in part by the effects of high temperatures, drought and
fire on terrestrial ecosystems in the tropics. 

Land and ocean uptake of CO2 can now be separated using
atmospheric measurements (CO2, oxygen (O2) and  13CO2). For
1980 to 1989, the ocean-atmosphere flux is estimated as −1.9 ±
0.6 PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere flux as −0.2 ± 0.7 PgC/yr
based on CO2 and O2 measurements (negative signs denote net
uptake). For  1990  to  1999, the  ocean-atmosphere  flux  is
estimated as −1.7 ± 0.5 PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere flux as
−1.4 ± 0.7 PgC/yr. These figures are consistent with alternative
budgets  based  on  CO2 and  13CO2 measurements, and  with
independent estimates based on measurements of CO2 and 13CO2
in sea water. The new 1980s estimates are also consistent with the
ocean-model  based  carbon  budget  of  the  IPCC  WGI  Second
Assessment  Report  (IPCC, 1996a)  (hereafter  SAR).  The  new
1990s estimates update the budget derived using SAR method-
ologies  for  the  IPCC Special  Report  on  Land  Use, Land  Use
Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000a).

The net CO2 release due to land-use change during the 1980s
has  been  estimated  as  0.6  to  2.5  PgC/yr  (central  estimate  1.7
PgC/yr). This net CO2 release is mainly due to deforestation in
the  tropics.  Uncertainties  about  land-use  changes  limit  the

accuracy of these estimates. Comparable data for the 1990s are
not yet available. 

The  land-atmosphere  flux  estimated  from  atmospheric
observations  comprises  the  balance of  net  CO2 release  due  to
land-use  changes  and  CO2 uptake  by  terrestrial  systems  (the
“residual  terrestrial  sink”).  The  residual  terrestrial  sink  is
estimated as −1.9 PgC/yr (range −3.8 to +0.3 PgC/yr) during the
1980s.  It  has  several  likely  causes, including  changes  in  land
management  practices  and  fertilisation  effects  of  increased
atmospheric  CO2 and  nitrogen  (N)  deposition, leading  to
increased vegetation and soil carbon.

Modelling  based  on  atmospheric  observations  (inverse
modelling)  enables  the  land-atmosphere  and  ocean-atmosphere
fluxes to be partitioned between broad latitudinal bands. The sites
of  anthropogenic  CO2 uptake  in  the  ocean  are  not  resolved  by
inverse modelling because of the large, natural background air-
sea fluxes (outgassing in the tropics and uptake in high latitudes).
Estimates of the land-atmosphere flux north of 30°N during 1980
to 1989 range from −2.3 to −0.6 PgC/yr; for the tropics, −1.0 to
+1.5 PgC/yr. These results imply substantial terrestrial sinks for
anthropogenic  CO2 in  the  northern  extra-tropics, and  in  the
tropics  (to  balance  deforestation).  The  pattern  for  the  1980s
persisted into the 1990s. 

Terrestrial  carbon  inventory  data  indicate  carbon  sinks  in
northern and tropical forests, consistent with the results of inverse
modelling.

East-west gradients of atmospheric CO2 concentration are an
order of magnitude smaller than north-south gradients. Estimates
of continental-scale CO2 balance are possible in principle but are
poorly constrained because there are too few well-calibrated CO2
monitoring  sites, especially  in  the  interior  of  continents, and
insufficient  data  on  air-sea  fluxes  and  vertical  transport  in  the
atmosphere.

The global carbon cycle and anthropogenic CO2

The global carbon cycle operates through a variety of response
and  feedback  mechanisms.  The  most  relevant  for  decade  to
century time-scales are listed here.

Responses of the carbon cycle to changing CO2 concentrations
•  Uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2 by  the  ocean  is  primarily
governed  by  ocean  circulation  and  carbonate  chemistry.  So
long as atmospheric CO2 concentration is increasing there is net
uptake of carbon by the ocean, driven by the atmosphere-ocean
difference  in  partial  pressure  of  CO2. The  fraction  of  anthro-
pogenic  CO2 that  is  taken  up  by  the  ocean  declines  with
increasing CO2 concentration, due to reduced buffer capacity of
the carbonate system. The fraction taken up by the ocean also
declines with the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2, because
the rate of mixing between deep water and surface water limits
CO2 uptake. 

•  Increasing  atmospheric  CO2 has  no  significant  fertilisation
effect  on  marine  biological  productivity, but  it  decreases  pH.
Over  a  century, changes  in  marine  biology  brought  about  by
changes  in  calcification  at  low  pH  could  increase  the  ocean
uptake of CO2 by a few percentage points.

186

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

• Terrestrial uptake of CO2 is governed by net biome produc-
tion (NBP), which is the balance of net primary production
(NPP)  and  carbon  losses  due  to  heterotrophic  respiration
(decomposition and herbivory) and fire, including the fate of
harvested  biomass.  NPP  increases  when  atmospheric  CO2
concentration is increased above present levels (the “fertili-
sation” effect  occurs  directly  through  enhanced  photo-
synthesis, and  indirectly  through  effects  such  as  increased
water  use  efficiency).  At  high  CO2 concentration  (800  to
1,000 ppm) any further direct CO2 fertilisation effect is likely
to be small. The effectiveness of terrestrial uptake as a carbon
sink  depends  on  the  transfer  of  carbon  to  forms  with  long
residence  times  (wood  or  modified  soil  organic  matter).
Management practices can enhance the carbon sink because
of the inertia of these “slow” carbon pools.

Feedbacks in the carbon cycle due to climate change
• Warming reduces the solubility of CO2 and therefore reduces

uptake of CO2 by the ocean. 

•  Increased  vertical  stratification  in  the  ocean  is  likely  to
accompany  increasing  global  temperature.  The  likely
consequences include reduced outgassing of upwelled CO2,
reduced  transport  of  excess  carbon  to  the  deep  ocean, and
changes in biological productivity.

•  On  short  time-scales, warming  increases  the  rate  of
heterotrophic respiration on land, but the extent to which this
effect  can  alter  land-atmosphere  fluxes  over  longer  time-
scales  is  not  yet  clear.  Warming, and  regional  changes  in
precipitation patterns and cloudiness, are also likely to bring
about changes in terrestrial ecosystem structure, geographic
distribution and primary production. The net effect of climate
on NBP depends on regional patterns of climate change.

Other impacts on the carbon cycle
•  Changes  in  management  practices  are  very  likely  to  have
significant effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. In addition
to  deforestation  and  afforestation/reforestation, more  subtle
management  effects  can  be  important.  For  example, fire
suppression (e.g., in savannas) reduces CO2 emissions from
burning, and  encourages  woody  plant  biomass  to  increase.
On agricultural lands, some of the soil carbon lost when land
was  cleared  and  tilled  can  be  regained  through  adoption  of
low-tillage agriculture.

• Anthropogenic N deposition is increasing terrestrial NPP in
some regions; excess tropospheric ozone (O3) is likely to be
reducing NPP.

• Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the oceans by rivers and
atmospheric  dust  may  influence  marine  biological  produc-
tivity, although such effects are poorly quantified.

Modelling and projection of CO2 concentration

Process-based models of oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycling
have  been  developed, compared  and  tested  against  in  situ
measurements and atmospheric measurements. The following
are consistent results based on several models.
• Modelled ocean-atmosphere flux during 1980 to 1989 was in

the range −1.5 to −2.2 PgC/yr for the 1980s, consistent with
earlier model estimates and consistent with the atmospheric
budget. 

• Modelled land-atmosphere flux during 1980 to 1989 was in
the  range  −0.3  to  −1.5  PgC/yr, consistent  with  or  slightly
more negative than the land-atmosphere flux as indicated by
the atmospheric budget. CO2 fertilisation and anthropogenic
N  deposition  effects  contributed  significantly: their
combined  effect  was  estimated  as  −1.5  to  −3.1  PgC/yr.
Effects of climate change during the 1980s were small, and
of uncertain sign. 

•  In  future  projections  with  ocean  models, driven  by  CO2
concentrations derived from the IS92a scenario (for illustra-
tion  and  comparison  with  earlier  work), ocean  uptake
becomes progressively larger towards the end of the century,
but  represents  a  smaller  fraction  of  emissions  than  today.
When climate change feedbacks are included, ocean uptake
becomes  less  in  all  models, when  compared  with  the
situation without climate feedbacks. 

• In analogous projections with terrestrial models, the rate of
uptake  by  the  land  due  to  CO2 fertilisation  increases  until
mid-century, but the models project smaller increases, or no
increase, after that time. When climate change feedbacks are
included, land  uptake  becomes  less  in  all  models, when
compared  with  the  situation  without  climate  feedbacks.
Some  models  have  shown  a  rapid  decline  in  carbon  uptake
after the mid-century.

Two simplified, fast models (ISAM and Bern-CC) were used to
project future CO2 concentrations under IS92a and six SRES
scenarios, and  to  project  future  emissions  under  five  CO2
stabilisation  scenarios.  Both  models  represent  ocean  and
terrestrial climate feedbacks, in a way consistent with process-
based models, and allow for uncertainties in climate sensitivity
and in ocean and terrestrial responses to CO2 and climate.

•  The  reference  case  projections  (which  include  climate
feedbacks) of both models under IS92a are, by coincidence,
close to those made in the SAR (which neglected feedbacks). 
•  The  SRES  scenarios  lead  to  divergent  CO2 concentration
trajectories. Among the six emissions scenarios considered,
the projected range of CO2 concentrations at the end of the
century is 550 to 970 ppm (ISAM model) or 540 to 960 ppm
(Bern-CC model). 

•  Variations  in  climate  sensitivity  and  ocean  and  terrestrial
model  responses  add  at  least  −10  to  +30%  uncertainty  to
these values, and to the emissions implied by the stabilisation
scenarios. 

• The net effect of land and ocean climate feedbacks is always
to increase projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This
is equivalent to reducing the allowable emissions for stabili-
sation at any one CO2 concentration. 

•  New  studies  with  general  circulation  models  including
interactive  land  and  ocean  carbon  cycle  components  also
indicate that climate feedbacks have the potential to increase
atmospheric    CO2 but  with  large  uncertainty  about  the
magnitude of the terrestrial biosphere feedback. 

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

187

Implications

CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning are virtually certain
to  be  the  dominant  factor  determining  CO2 concentrations
during the 21st century. There is scope for land-use changes
to increase or decrease CO2 concentrations on this time-scale.
If all of the carbon so far released by land-use changes could
be restored to the terrestrial biosphere, CO2 at the end of the
century would be  40 to 70 ppm less than it would be if no
such  intervention  had  occurred.  By  comparison, global
deforestation would add two to four times more CO2 to the
atmosphere  than  reforestation  of  all  cleared  areas  would
subtract.

There is sufficient uptake capacity in the ocean to incorporate
70  to  80%  of  foreseeable  anthropogenic  CO2 emissions  to  the
atmosphere, this process takes centuries due to the rate of ocean
mixing.    As  a  result, even  several  centuries  after  emissions
occurred, about a quarter of the increase in concentration caused
by these emissions is still present in the atmosphere.

CO2 stabilisation  at  450, 650  or  1,000  ppm  would  require
global anthropogenic CO2 emissions to drop below 1990 levels,
within  a  few  decades, about  a  century, or  about  two  centuries
respectively, and  continue  to  steadily  decrease  thereafter.
Stabilisation  requires  that  net  anthropogenic  CO2 emissions
ultimately decline to the level of persistent natural land and ocean
sinks, which are expected to be small (<0.2 PgC/yr).

3.1 Introduction

The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen from close
to 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1800, at first slowly and then
progressively faster to a value of 367 ppm in 1999, echoing the
increasing  pace  of  global  agricultural  and  industrial  develop-
ment. This is known from numerous, well-replicated measure-
ments of the composition of air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice.
Atmospheric  CO2 concentrations  have  been  measured  directly
with high precision since 1957; these measurements agree with
ice-core  measurements, and  show  a  continuation  of  the
increasing trend up to the present.

Several additional lines of evidence confirm that the recent
and continuing increase of atmospheric CO2 content is caused
by anthropogenic CO2 emissions – most importantly fossil fuel
burning. First, atmospheric O2 is declining at a rate comparable
with  fossil  fuel  emissions  of  CO2 (combustion  consumes  O2).
Second, the characteristic isotopic signatures of fossil fuel (its
lack of 14C, and depleted content of 13C) leave their mark in the
atmosphere. Third, the increase in observed CO2 concentration
has  been  faster  in  the  northern  hemisphere, where  most  fossil
fuel burning occurs. 

Atmospheric CO2 is, however, increasing only at about half
the  rate  of  fossil  fuel  emissions;  the  rest  of  the  CO2 emitted
either dissolves in sea water and mixes into the deep ocean, or is
taken up by terrestrial ecosystems. Uptake by terrestrial ecosys-
tems is due to an excess of primary production (photosynthesis)
over respiration and other oxidative processes (decomposition or
combustion of organic material). Terrestrial systems are also an

anthropogenic source of CO2 when land-use changes (particu-
larly deforestation) lead to loss of carbon from plants and soils.
Nonetheless, the global balance in terrestrial systems is currently
a net uptake of CO2. 

The part of fossil fuel CO2 that is taken up by the ocean and
the part that is taken up by the land can be calculated from the
changes in atmospheric CO2 and O2 content because terrestrial
processes of CO2 exchange involve exchange of oxygen whereas
dissolution in the ocean does not. Global carbon budgets based
on  CO2 and  O2 measurements  for  the  1980s  and  1990s  are
shown in Table 3.1. The human influence on the fluxes of carbon
among the three “reservoirs” (atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial
biosphere)  represent  a  small  but  significant  perturbation  of  a
huge global cycle (Figure 3.1).

This  chapter  summarises  current  knowledge  of  the  global
carbon cycle, with special reference to the fate of fossil fuel CO2
and the factors that influence the uptake or release of CO2 by the
oceans and land. These factors include atmospheric CO2 concen-
tration itself, the naturally variable climate, likely climate changes
caused by increasing CO2 and other greenhouse gases, changes in
ocean circulation and biology, fertilising effects of atmospheric
CO2 and nitrogen deposition, and direct human actions such as
land  conversion  (from  native  vegetation  to  agriculture  and  vice
versa), fire suppression and land management for carbon storage
as  provided  for  by  the  Kyoto  Protocol  (IPCC, 2000a).  Any
changes in the function of either the terrestrial biosphere or the
ocean − whether intended or not − could potentially have signifi-
cant effects, manifested within years to decades, on the fraction of
fossil fuel CO2 that stays in the atmosphere. This perspective has

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

189

driven a great deal of research during the years since the IPCC
WGI Second Assessment  report  (IPCC, 1996)  (hereafter  SAR)
(Schimel et al., 1996; Melillo et al., 1996; Denman et al., 1996).
Some major areas where advances have been made since the SAR
are as follows:
•  Observational  research  (atmospheric, marine  and  terrestrial)
aimed  at  a  better  quantification  of  carbon  fluxes  on  local,
regional and global scales. For example, improved precision and
repeatability  in  atmospheric  CO2 and  stable  isotope  measure-
ments; the development of highly precise methods to measure
changes in atmospheric O2 concentrations; local terrestrial CO2
flux  measurements  from  towers, which  are  now  being
performed continuously in many terrestrial ecosystems; satellite
observations  of  global  land  cover  and  change;  and  enhanced
monitoring of geographical, seasonal and interannual variations
of  biogeochemical  parameters  in  the  sea, including  measure-
ments of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in surface waters.
•  Experimental  manipulations, for  example: laboratory  and
greenhouse experiments with raised and lowered CO2 concen-
trations; field experiments on ecosystems using free-air carbon
dioxide  enrichment  (FACE)  and  open-top  chamber  studies  of
raised CO2 effects, studies of soil warming and nutrient enrich-
ment  effects;  and  in  situ fertilisation  experiments  on  marine
ecosystems and associated pCO2 measurements.

• Theory  and  modelling, especially  applications  of  atmospheric
transport  models  to  link  atmospheric  observations  to  surface
fluxes  (inverse  modelling);  the  development  of  process-based
models  of  terrestrial  and  marine  carbon  cycling  and
programmes to compare and test these models against observa-
tions; and the use of such models to project climate feedbacks
on the uptake of CO2 by the oceans and land.

As  a  result  of  this  research, there  is  now  a  more  firmly  based
knowledge  of  several  central  features  of  the  carbon  cycle.  For
example:
• Time series of atmospheric CO2, O2 and  13CO2 measurements
have  made  it  possible  to  observationally  constrain  the
partitioning of CO2 between terrestrial and oceanic uptake and
to confirm earlier budgets, which were partly based on model
results.

• In situ experiments have explored the nature and extent of CO2
responses  in  a  variety  of  terrestrial  ecosystems  (including
forests), and have confirmed the existence of iron limitations on
marine productivity.

• Process-based models of terrestrial and marine biogeochemical
processes  have  been  used  to  represent  a  complex  array  of
feedbacks in the carbon cycle, allowing the net effects of these
processes  to  be  estimated  for  the  recent  past  and  for  future
scenarios.

Figure 3.1: The global carbon cycle: storages (PgC) and fluxes (PgC/yr) estimated for the 1980s. (a) Main components of the natural cycle. The
thick arrows denote the most important fluxes from the point of view of the contemporary CO2 balance of the atmosphere: gross primary produc-
tion and respiration by the land biosphere, and physical air-sea exchange. These fluxes are approximately balanced each year, but imbalances can
affect atmospheric CO2 concentration significantly over years to centuries. The thin arrows denote additional natural fluxes (dashed lines for
fluxes of carbon as CaCO3), which are important on longer time-scales. The flux of 0.4 PgC/yr from atmospheric CO2 via plants to inert soil
carbon is approximately balanced on a time-scale of several millenia by export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers (Schlesinger, 1990). A
further 0.4 PgC/yr flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is derived from the weathering of CaCO3, which takes up CO2 from the atmosphere in
a 1:1 ratio. These fluxes of DOC and DIC together comprise the river transport of 0.8 PgC/yr. In the ocean, the DOC from rivers is respired and
released to the atmosphere, while CaCO3 production by marine organisms results in half of the DIC from rivers being returned to the atmosphere
and half being buried in deep-sea sediments − which are the precursor of carbonate rocks. Also shown are processes with even longer time-scales:
burial of organic matter as fossil organic carbon (including fossil fuels), and outgassing of CO2 through tectonic processes (vulcanism). Emissions
due to vulcanism are estimated as 0.02 to 0.05 PgC/yr (Williams et al., 1992; Bickle, 1994). (b) The human perturbation (data from Table 3.1).
Fossil fuel burning and land-use change are the main anthropogenic processes that release CO2 to the atmosphere. Only a part of this CO2 stays in
the atmosphere; the rest is taken up by the land (plants and soil) or by the ocean. These uptake components represent imbalances in the large
natural two-way fluxes between atmosphere and ocean and between atmosphere and land. (c) Carbon cycling in the ocean. CO2 that dissolves in
−, the sum of which is DIC). DIC is transported in the ocean by physical and biological
the ocean is found in three main forms (CO2, CO3
processes. Gross primary production (GPP) is the total amount of organic carbon produced by photosynthesis (estimate from Bender et al., 1994);
net primary production (NPP) is what is what remains after autotrophic respiration, i.e., respiration by photosynthetic organisms (estimate from
Falkowski et al., 1998). Sinking of DOC and particulate organic matter (POC) of biological origin results in a downward flux known as export
production (estimate from Schlitzer, 2000). This organic matter is tranported and respired by non-photosynthetic organisms (heterotrophic respira-
tion) and ultimately upwelled and returned to the atmosphere. Only a tiny fraction is buried in deep-sea sediments. Export of CaCO3 to the deep
ocean is a smaller flux than total export production (0.4 PgC/yr) but about half of this carbon is buried as CaCO3 in sediments; the other half is
dissolved at depth, and joins the pool of DIC (Milliman, 1993). Also shown are approximate fluxes for the shorter-term burial of organic carbon
and CaCO3 in coastal sediments and the re-dissolution of a part of the buried CaCO3 from these sediments. (d) Carbon cycling on land. By
contrast with the ocean, most carbon cycling through the land takes place locally within ecosystems. About half of GPP is respired by plants. The
remainer (NPP) is approximately balanced by heterotrophic respiration with a smaller component of direct oxidation in fires (combustion).
Through senescence of plant tissues, most of NPP joins the detritus pool; some detritus decomposes (i.e., is respired and returned to the
atmosphere as CO2) quickly while some is converted to modified soil carbon, which decomposes more slowly. The small fraction of modified soil
carbon that is further converted to compounds resistant to decomposition, and the small amount of black carbon produced in fires, constitute the
“inert” carbon pool. It is likely that biological processes also consume much of the “inert” carbon as well but little is currently known about these
processes. Estimates for soil carbon amounts are from Batjes (1996) and partitioning from Schimel et al. (1994) and Falloon et al. (1998). The
estimate for the combustion flux is from Scholes and Andreae (2000). ‘τ’ denotes the turnover time for different components of soil organic matter.

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

Box 3.1: Measuring terrestrial carbon stocks and fluxes.

Estimating the carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and accounting for changes in these stocks requires adequate information
on land cover, carbon density in vegetation and soils, and the fate of carbon (burning, removals, decomposition). Accounting for
changes in all carbon stocks in all areas would yield the net carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere
(NBP).

Global land cover maps show poor agreement due to different definitions of cover types and inconsistent sources of data (de
Fries and Townshend, 1994). Land cover changes are difficult to document, uncertainties are large, and historical data are sparse.
Satellite imagery is a valuable tool for estimating land cover, despite problems with cloud cover, changes at fine spatial scales,
and  interpretation  (for  example, difficulties  in  distinguishing  primary  and  secondary  forest). Aerial  photography  and  ground
measurements can be used to validate satellite-based observations.

The carbon density of vegetation and soils has been measured in numerous ecological field studies that have been aggregated
to a global scale to assess carbon stocks and NPP (e.g., Atjay et al., 1979; Olson et al., 1983; Saugier and Roy, 2001; Table 3.2),
although high spatial and temporal heterogeneity and methodological differences introduce large uncertainties. Land inventory
studies tend to measure the carbon stocks in vegetation and soils over larger areas and/or longer time periods. For example, the
United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has been compiling forest inventories since 1946 providing detailed
data on carbon stocks, often based on commercial wood production data. Inventory studies include managed forests with mixed
age stands, thus average carbon stock values are often lower than those based on ecological site studies, which have generally
been carried out in relatively undisturbed, mature ecosystems. Fluxes of carbon can be estimated from changes in inventoried
carbon stocks (e.g., UN-ECE/FAO, 2000), or from combining data on land-use change with methods to calculate changes in
carbon stock (e.g., Houghton, 1999). The greatest uncertainty in both methods is in estimating the fate of the carbon: the fraction
which is burned, rates of decomposition, the effect of burning and harvesting on soil carbon, and subsequent land management.
Ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange on short time-scales can be measured using micrometeorological techniques such as
eddy covariance, which relies on rapidly responding sensors mounted on towers to resolve the net flux of CO2 between a patch
of land and the atmosphere (Baldocchi et al., 1988). The annual integral of the measured CO2 exchange is approximately equiva-
lent to NEP (Wofsy et al., 1993; Goulden et. al, 1996; Aubinet et al., 2000). This innovation has led to the establishment of a
rapidly  expanding  network  of  long-term  monitoring  sites  (FLUXNET)  with  many  sites  now  operating  for  several  years,
improving the understanding of the physiological and ecological processes that control NEP (e.g., Valentini et al., 2000). The
distribution  of  sites  is  currently  biased  toward  regrowing  forests  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere, and  there  are  still  technical
problems and uncertainties, although these are being tackled. Current flux measurement techniques typically integrate processes
at a scale less than 1 km2.

Table 3.1: Global CO2 budgets (in PgC/yr) based on intra-decadal trends in atmospheric CO2 and O2. Positive values are fluxes to the atmosphere;
negative values represent uptake from the atmosphere. The fossil fuel emissions term for the 1980s (Marland et al., 2000) has been slightly revised
downward since the SAR.  Error bars denote uncertainty (±1σ), not interannual variability, which is substantially greater.

Land-use change 1.7 (0.6 to 2.5) NA
Residual terrestrial sink −1.9 (−3.8 to 0.3) NA

* The land-atmosphere flux represents the balance of a positive term due to land-use change and a residual terrestrial sink.  The two terms cannot
be separated on the basis of current atmospheric measurements. Using independent analyses to estimate the land-use change component for the
1980s based on Houghton (1999), Houghton and Hackler (1999), Houghton et al. (2000), and the CCMLP (McGuire et al., 2001) the residual
terrestrial sink can be inferred for the 1980s.  Comparable global data on land-use changes through the 1990s are not yet available.

3.2 Terrestrial and Ocean Biogeochemistry: Update on 

Processes

3.2.1 Overview of the Carbon Cycle

The first panel of Figure 3.1 shows the major components of the
carbon  cycle, estimates  of  the  current  storage  in  the  active
compartments, and  estimates  of  the  gross  fluxes  between
compartments.  The  second  panel  shows  best  estimates  of  the
additional  flux  (release  to  the  atmosphere  –  positive;  uptake  –
negative) associated with the human perturbation of the carbon
cycle during the 1980s. Note that the gross amounts of carbon
annually  exchanged  between  the  ocean  and  atmosphere, and
between the land and atmosphere, represent a sizeable fraction of
the atmospheric CO2 content – and are many times larger than the
total anthropogenic CO2 input. In consequence, an imbalance in
these exchanges could easily lead to an anomaly of comparable
magnitude to the direct anthropogenic perturbation. This implies
that it is important to consider how these fluxes may be changing
in response to human activities.

To  understand  how  the  changing  global  environment  may
alter the carbon cycle, it is necessary to further analyse the fluxes
and examine the physicochemical and biological processes that
determine them. The remaining two panels of Figure 3.1 indicate
the main constituent fluxes in the terrestrial and marine systems,
with current estimates of their magnitude. The following sections
explain  the  controls  on  these  fluxes, with  special  reference  to
processes  by  which  anthropogenic  changes  may  influence  the
overall  carbon  balance  of  the  land  and  oceans  on  time-scales
from years to centuries.

3.2.2 Terrestrial Carbon Processes

3.2.2.1 Background
Higher  plants  acquire  CO2 by  diffusion  through  tiny  pores
(stomata) into leaves and thus to the sites of photosynthesis. The
total  amount  of  CO2 that  dissolves  in  leaf  water  amounts  to
about 270 PgC/yr, i.e., more than one-third of all the CO2 in the
atmosphere  (Farquhar  et  al., 1993;  Ciais  et  al., 1997).  This
quantity is measurable because this CO2 has time to exchange
oxygen  atoms  with  the  leaf  water  and  is  imprinted  with  the
corresponding  18O  “signature” (Francey  and  Tans, 1987;
Farquhar  et  al., 1993).  Most  of  this  CO2 diffuses  out  again
without  participating  in  photosynthesis.  The  amount  that  is
“fixed” from  the  atmosphere, i.e., converted  from  CO2 to
carbohydrate during photosynthesis, is known as gross primary
production (GPP). Terrestrial GPP has been estimated as about
120  PgC/yr  based  on  18O  measurements  of atmospheric  CO2
(Ciais et al., 1997). This is also the approximate value necessary
to  support  observed  plant  growth, assuming  that  about  half  of
GPP is incorporated into new plant tissues such as leaves, roots
and wood, and the other half is converted back to atmospheric
CO2 by  autotrophic  respiration  (respiration  by  plant  tissues)
(Lloyd and Farquhar, 1996; Waring et al., 1998). 

Annual  plant  growth  is  the  difference  between  photo-
synthesis  and  autotrophic  respiration, and  is  referred  to  as  net
primary production (NPP). NPP has been measured in all major

ecosystem types by sequential harvesting or by measuring plant
biomass  (Hall  et  al., 1993).  Global  terrestrial  NPP  has  been
estimated  at  about  60  PgC/yr  through  integration  of  field
measurements (Table 3.2) (Atjay et al., 1979; Saugier and Roy,
2001). Estimates from remote sensing and atmospheric CO2 data
(Ruimy et al., 1994; Knorr and Heimann, 1995) concur with this
value, although  there  are  large  uncertainties  in  all  methods.
Eventually, virtually all of the carbon fixed in NPP is returned to
the atmospheric CO2 pool through two processes: heterotrophic
respiration (Rh) by decomposers (bacteria and fungi feeding on
dead  tissue  and  exudates)  and  herbivores;  and  combustion  in
natural or human-set fires (Figure 3.1d).

Most dead biomass enters the detritus and soil organic matter
pools where it is respired at a rate that depends on the chemical
composition of the dead tissues and on environmental conditions
(for example, low temperatures, dry conditions and flooding slow
down  decomposition).  Conceptually, several  soil  carbon  pools
are  distinguished.  Detritus  and  microbial  biomass  have  a  short
turnover time (<10 yr). Modified soil organic carbon has decadal
to  centennial  turnover  time.  Inert  (stable  or  recalcitrant)  soil
organic carbon is composed of molecules more or less resistant
to further decomposition. A very small fraction of soil organic
matter, and a small fraction of burnt biomass, are converted into
inert forms (Schlesinger, 1990; Kuhlbusch et al., 1996). Natural
processes and management regimes may reduce or increase the
amount of carbon stored in pools with turnover times on the order
of  tens  to  hundreds  of  years  (living  wood, wood  products  and
modified  soil  organic  matter)  and  thus  influence  the  time
evolution of atmospheric CO2 over the century. 

The difference between NPP and Rh determines how much
carbon  is  lost  or  gained  by  the  ecosystem  in  the  absence  of
disturbances  that  remove  carbon  from  the  ecosystem  (such  as
harvest or fire). This carbon balance, or net ecosystem produc-
tion (NEP), can be estimated from changes in carbon stocks, or
by measuring the fluxes of CO2 between patches of land and the
atmosphere (see Box 3.1). Annual NEP flux measurements are
in the range 0.7 to 5.9 MgC/ha/yr for tropical forests and 0.8 to
7.0 MgC/ha/yr for temperate forests; boreal forests can reach up
to 2.5 MgC/ha/yr although they have been shown to be carbon-
neutral  or  to  release  carbon  in  warm  and/or  cloudy  years
(Valentini  et  al., 2000).  Integration  of  these  and  other  results
leads to an estimated global NEP of about 10 PgC/yr, although
this is likely to be an overestimate because of the current biased
distribution of flux measuring sites (Bolin et al., 2000). 

When  other  losses  of  carbon  are  accounted  for, including
fires, harvesting/removals  (eventually  combusted  or
decomposed), erosion  and  export  of  dissolved  or  suspended
organic carbon (DOC) by rivers to the oceans (Schlesinger and
Melack, 1981; Sarmiento and Sundquist; 1992), what remains is
the net biome production (NBP), i.e., the carbon accumulated by
the terrestrial biosphere (Schulze and Heimann, 1998). This is
what the atmosphere ultimately “sees” as the net land uptake on
a global scale over periods of a year or more. NBP is estimated
in this chapter to have averaged −0.2 ± 0.7 PgC/yr during the
1980s  and −1.4  ± 0.7  PgC/yr  during  the  1990s, based  on
atmospheric  measurements  of  CO2 and  O2 (Section  3.5.1  and
Table 3.1).

192

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

Box 3.2: Maximum impacts of reforestation and deforestation on atmospheric CO2.
Rough upper bounds for the impact of reforestation on atmospheric CO2 concentration over a century time-scale can be calculated
as follows. Cumulative carbon losses to the atmosphere due to land-use change during the past 1 to 2 centuries are estimated as
180 to 200 PgC (de Fries et al., 1999) and cumulative fossil fuel emissions to year 2000 as 280 PgC (Marland et al., 2000), giving
cumulative  anthropogenic  emissions  of  480  to  500  PgC.  Atmospheric  CO2 content  has  increased  by  90  ppm  (190  PgC).
Approximately 40% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has thus remained in the atmosphere; the rest has been taken up by the land
and oceans in roughly equal proportions (see main text). Conversely, if land-use change were completely reversed over the 21st
century, a CO2 reduction of 0.40 × 200 = 80 PgC (about 40 ppm) might be expected. This calculation assumes that future ecosys-
tems will not store more carbon than pre-industrial ecosystems, and that ocean uptake will be less because of lower CO2 concen-
tration in the atmosphere (see Section 3.2.3.1) . 

A higher bound can be obtained by assuming that the carbon taken up by the land during the past 1 to 2 centuries, i.e. about
half of the carbon taken up by the land and ocean combined, will be retained there. This calculation yields a CO2 reduction of
0.70 × 200 = 140 PgC (about 70 ppm). These calculations are not greatly influenced by the choice of reference period. Both
calculations require the extreme assumption that a large proportion of today’s agricultural land is returned to forest.

The maximum impact of total deforestation can be calculated in a similar way. Depending on different assumptions about
vegetation and soil carbon density in different ecosystem types (Table 3.2) and the proportion of soil carbon lost during deforesta-
tion (20 to 50%; IPCC, 1997), complete conversion of forests to climatically equivalent grasslands would add 400 to 800 PgC to
the atmosphere. Thus, global deforestation could theoretically add two to four times more CO2 to the atmosphere than could be
subtracted by reforestation of cleared areas.

By definition, for an ecosystem in steady state, Rh and other
carbon losses would just balance NPP, and NBP would be zero.
In  reality, human  activities, natural  disturbances  and  climate
variability  alter  NPP  and  Rh, causing  transient  changes  in  the
terrestrial  carbon  pool  and  thus  non-zero  NBP. If  the  rate  of
carbon input (NPP) changes, the rate of carbon output (Rh) also
changes, in proportion to the altered carbon content; but there is
a time lag between changes in NPP and changes in the slower
responding  carbon  pools.  For  a  step increase  in  NPP, NBP  is
expected  to  increase  at  first  but  to  relax  towards  zero  over  a
period  of  years  to  decades  as  the  respiring  pool  “catches  up”.
The  globally  averaged  lag  required  for  Rh  to  catch  up  with  a
change in NPP has been estimated to be of the order of 10 to 30
years (Raich and Schlesinger, 1992). A continuous increase in
NPP is expected to produce a sustained positive NBP, so long as
NPP  is  still  increasing, so  that  the  increased  terrestrial  carbon
has  not  been  processed  through  the  respiring  carbon  pools
(Taylor and Lloyd, 1992; Friedlingstein et al., 1995a; Thompson
et  al., 1996;  Kicklighter  et  al., 1999), and  provided  that  the
increase  is  not  outweighed  by  compensating  increases  in
mortality or disturbance.

The terrestrial system is currently acting as a global sink for
carbon  (Table  3.1)  despite  large  releases  of  carbon  due  to
deforestation in some regions. Likely mechanisms for the sink
are  known, but  their  relative  contribution  is  uncertain. Natural
climate variability and disturbance regimes (including fire and
herbivory) affect NBP through their impacts on NPP, allocation
to long- versus short-lived tissues, chemical and physical proper-
ties of litter, stocks of living biomass, stocks of detritus and soil
carbon, environmental  controls  on  decomposition  and  rates  of
biomass removal. Human impacts occur through changes in land
use  and  land  management, and  through  indirect  mechanisms
including climate change, and fertilisation due to elevated CO2
and deposition of nutrients (most importantly, reactive nitrogen).
These  mechanisms  are  discussed  individually  in  the  following
sections.

3.2.2.2 Effects of changes in land use and land management
Changes  in  land  use  and  management  affect  the  amount  of
carbon in plant biomass and soils. Historical cumulative carbon
losses due to changes in land use have been estimated to be 180
to  200  PgC  by  comparing  maps  of  “natural” vegetation  in  the
absence  of  human  disturbance  (derived  from  ground-based
information (Matthews, 1983) or from modelled potential vegeta-
tion  based  on  climate  (Leemans, 1990))  to  a  map  of  current
vegetation derived from 1987 satellite data (de Fries et al., 1999).
Houghton (1999, 2000) estimated emissions of 121 PgC (approx-
imately 60% in tropical areas and 40% in temperate areas) for the
period  1850  to  1990  from  statistics  on  land-use  change, and  a
simple  model  tracking  rates  of  decomposition  from  different
pools  and  rates  of  regrowth  on  abandoned  or  reforested  land.
There  was  substantial  deforestation  in  temperate  areas  prior  to
1850, and  this  may  be  partially  reflected  in  the  difference
between  these  two  analyses.  The  estimated  land-use  emissions
during 1850 to 1990 of 121 PgC (Houghton, 1999, 2000) can be
compared  to  estimated  net  terrestrial  flux  of  39  PgC  to  the
atmosphere over the same period inferred from an atmospheric

increase of 144 PgC (Etheridge et al., 1996; Keeling and Whorf,
2000), a release of 212 PgC due to fossil fuel burning (Marland et
al., 2000), and a modelled ocean-atmosphere flux of about −107
PgC (Gruber, 1998, Sabine et al., 1999, Feely et al., 1999a). The
difference between the net terrestrial flux and estimated land-use
change emissions implies a residual land-atmosphere flux of −82
PgC  (i.e., a  terrestrial  sink)  over  the  same  period.  Box  3.2
indicates  the  theoretical  upper  bounds  for  additional  carbon
storage due to land-use change, similar bounds for carbon loss by
continuing  deforestation, and  the  implications  of  these  calcula-
tions for atmospheric CO2.

Land  use  responds  to  social  and  economic  pressures  to
provide food, fuel and wood products, for subsistence use or for
export. Land clearing can lead to soil degradation, erosion and
leaching of nutrients, and may therefore reduce the subsequent
ability of the ecosystem to act as a carbon sink (Taylor and Lloyd,
1992). Ecosystem  conservation  and  management  practices  can
restore, maintain and enlarge carbon stocks (IPCC, 2000a). Fire
is  important  in  the  carbon  budget  of  some  ecosystems  (e.g.,
boreal forests, grasslands, tropical savannas and woodlands) and
is  affected  directly  by  management  and  indirectly  by  land-use
change (Apps et al., 1993). Fire is a major short-term source of
carbon, but  adds  to  a  small  longer-term  sink  (<0.1  PgC/yr)
through  production  of  slowly  decomposing  and  inert  black
carbon.

Forests
Deforestation  has  been  responsible  for  almost  90%  of  the
estimated emissions due to land-use change since 1850, with a
20%  decrease  of  the  global  forest  area  (Houghton, 1999).
Deforestation appears to be slowing slightly in tropical countries
(FAO, 1997;  Houghton, 2000), and  some  deforested  areas  in
Europe  and  North  America  have  been  reforested  in  recent
decades (FAO, 1997). Managed or regenerated forests generally
store less carbon than natural forests, even at maturity. New trees
take  up  carbon  rapidly, but  this  slows  down  towards  maturity
when  forests  can  be  slight  sources  or  sinks  (Buchmann  and
Schulze, 1999).  To  use  land  continuously  in  order  to  take  up
carbon, the wood must be harvested and turned into long-lived
products and trees must be re-planted. The trees may also be used
for biomass energy to avoid future fossil fuel emissions (Hall et
al., 2000). Analysis  of  scenarios  for  future  development  show
that  expanded  use  of  biomass  energy  could  reduce  the  rate  of
atmospheric CO2 increase (IPCC 1996b; Leemans et al., 1996;
Edmonds et al., 1996; Ishitani et al., 1996; IPCC, 2000a). IPCC
(1996b)  estimated  that  slowing  deforestation  and  promoting
natural  forest  regeneration  and  afforestation  could  increase
carbon  stocks  by  about  60  to  87  PgC  over  the  period  1995  to
2050, mostly in the tropics (Brown et al., 1996).

Savannas and grasslands – fire and grazing
Grasslands and mixed tree-grass systems are vulnerable to subtle
environmental and management changes that can lead to shifts in
vegetation  state  (Scholes  and  Archer, 1997;  House  and  Hall,
2001). Livestock grazing on these lands is the land use with the
largest  global  areal  extent  (FAO, 1993a).  Extensive  clearing  of
trees (for agricultural expansion) has occurred in some areas. In

194

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

other areas, fire suppression, eradication of indigenous browsers
and  the  introduction  of  intensive  grazing  and  exotic  trees  and
shrubs have caused an increase in woody plant density known as
woody  encroachment  or  tree  thickening  (Archer  et  al., 2001).
This process has been estimated to result in a CO2 sink of up to
0.17 PgC/yr in the USA during the 1980s (Houghton et al., 1999)
and at least 0.03 PgC/yr in Australia (Burrows, 1998). Grassland
ecosystems  have  high  root  production  and  store  most  of  their
carbon  in  soils  where  turnover  is  relatively  slow, allowing  the
possibility of enhancement through management (e.g., Fisher et
al., 1994).

Peatlands/wetlands
Peatlands/wetlands  are  large  reserves  of  carbon, because
anaerobic soil conditions and (in northern peatlands) low temper-
atures  reduce  decomposition  and  promote  accumulation  of
organic matter. Total carbon stored in northern peatlands has been
estimated  as  about  455  PgC  (Gorham, 1991)  with  a  current
uptake rate in extant northern peatlands of 0.07 PgC/yr (Clymo et
al., 1998). Anaerobic  decomposition  releases  methane  (CH4)
which has a global warming potential (GWP) about 23 times that
of CO2 (Chapter 6). The balance between CH4 release and CO2
uptake  and  release  is  highly  variable  and  poorly  understood.
Draining peatlands for agriculture increases total carbon released
by decomposition, although less is in the form of CH4. Forests
grown  on  drained  peatlands  may  be  sources  or  sinks  of  CO2
depending  on  the  balance  of  decomposition  and  tree  growth
(Minkkinen and Laine, 1998).

Agricultural land
Conversion of natural vegetation to agriculture is a major source
of CO2, not only due to losses of plant biomass but also, increased
decomposition of soil organic matter caused by disturbance and
energy  costs  of  various  agricultural  practices  (e.g., fertilisation
and  irrigation;  Schlesinger, 2000). Conversely, the  use  of  high-
yielding plant varieties, fertilisers, irrigation, residue management
and reduced tillage can reduce losses and enhance uptake within
managed  areas  (Cole  et  al., 1996;  Blume  et  al., 1998).  These
processes  have  led  to  an  estimated  increase  of  soil  carbon  in
agricultural  soils  in  the  USA  of  0.14  PgC/yr  during  the  1980s
(Houghton et al., 1999). IPCC (1996b) estimated that appropriate
management practices could increase carbon sinks by 0.4 to 0.9
PgC/yr , or a cumulative carbon storage of 24 to 43 PgC over 50
years; energy efficiency improvements and production of energy
from  dedicated  crops  and  residues  would  result  in  a  further
mitigation potential of 0.3 to 1.4 PgC/yr, or a cumulative carbon
storage of 16 to 68 PgC over 50 years (Cole et al., 1996).

Scenarios
The IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and
Forestry  (IPCC, 2000a)  (hereafter  SRLULUCF)  derived
scenarios of land-use emissions for the period 2008 to 2012. It
was estimated that a deforestation flux of 1.79 PgC/yr is likely to
be offset by reforestation and afforestation flux of −0.20 to −0.58
PgC/yr, yielding  a  net  release  of  1.59  to  1.20  PgC/yr
(Schlamadinger et al., 2000). The potential for net carbon storage
from  several  “additional  activities” such  as  improved  land

management  and  other  land-use  changes  was  estimated  to
amount  to  a  global  land-atmosphere  flux  in  the  region  of −1.3
PgC/yr  in  2010  and  −2.5  PgC/yr  in  2040, not  including  wood
products and bioenergy (Sampson et al., 2000).

3.2.2.3 Effects of climate
Solar  radiation, temperature  and  available  water  affect  photo-
synthesis, plant  respiration  and  decomposition, thus  climate
change  can  lead  to  changes  in  NEP.  A  substantial  part  of  the
interannual variability in the rate of increase of CO2 is likely to
reflect  terrestrial  biosphere  responses  to  climate  variability
(Section  3.5.3).  Warming  may  increase  NPP  in  temperate  and
arctic ecosystems where it can increase the length of the seasonal
and  daily  growing  cycles, but  it  may  decrease  NPP  in  water-
stressed  ecosystems  as  it  increases  water  loss.  Respiratory
processes are sensitive to temperature; soil and root respiration
have generally been shown to increase with warming in the short
term  (Lloyd  and  Taylor, 1994;  Boone  et  al., 1998)  although
evidence on longer-term impacts is conflicting (Trumbore, 2000;
Giardina and Ryan, 2000; Jarvis and Linder, 2000). Changes in
rainfall pattern affect plant water availability and the length of the
growing season, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Cloud
cover  can  be  beneficial  to  NPP  in  dry  areas  with  high  solar
radiation, but  detrimental  in  areas  with  low  solar  radiation.
Changing climate can also affect the distribution of plants and the
incidence of disturbances such as fire (which could increase or
decrease  depending  on  warming  and  precipitation  patterns,
possibly  resulting  under  some  circumstances  in  rapid  losses  of
carbon), wind, and  insect  and  pathogen  attacks, leading  to
changes  in  NBP.  The  global  balance  of  these  positive  and
negative effects of climate on NBP depends strongly on regional
aspects of climate change.

The climatic sensitivity of high northern latitude ecosystems
(tundra  and  taiga)  has  received  particular  attention  as  a
consequence of their expanse, high carbon density, and observa-
tions of disproportionate warming in these regions (Chapman and
Walsh, 1993;  Overpeck  et  al., 1997).  High-latitude  ecosystems
contain  about  25%  of  the  total  world  soil  carbon  pool  in  the
permafrost  and  the  seasonally-thawed  soil  layer.  This  carbon
storage  may  be  affected  by  changes  in  temperature  and  water
table depth. High latitude ecosystems have low NPP, in part due
to short growing seasons, and slow nutrient cycling because of
low  rates  of  decomposition  in  waterlogged  and  cold  soils.
Remotely  sensed  data  (Myneni  et  al., 1997)  and  phenological
observations (Menzel and Fabian, 1999) independently indicate a
recent  trend  to  longer  growing  seasons  in  the  boreal  zone  and
temperate  Europe.  Such  a  trend  might  be  expected  to  have
increased annual NPP. A shift towards earlier and stronger spring
depletion of atmospheric CO2 has also been observed at northern
stations, consistent with earlier onset of growth at mid- to high
northern  latitudes  (Manning, 1992;  Keeling  et  al., 1996a;
Randerson, 1999). However, recent  flux  measurements  at
individual  high-latitude  sites  have  generally  failed  to  find
appreciable  NEP  (Oechel  et  al., 1993;  Goulden  et  al., 1998;
Schulze et al., 1999; Oechel et al., 2000). These studies suggest
that, at least in the short term, any direct effect of warming on
NPP may be more than offset by an increased respiration of soil

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

carbon  caused  by  the  effects  of  increased  depth  of  soil  thaw.
Increased  decomposition, may, however  also  increase  nutrient
mineralisation and thereby indirectly stimulate NPP (Melillo et
al., 1993; Jarvis and Linder, 2000; Oechel et al., 2000).

Large areas of the tropics are arid and semi-arid, and plant
production is limited by water availability. There is evidence that
even evergreen tropical moist forests show reduced GPP during
the  dry  season  (Malhi  et  al., 1998)  and  may  become  a  carbon
source  under  the  hot, dry  conditions  of  typical  El  Niño  years.
With  a  warmer  ocean  surface, and  consequently  generally
increased precipitation, the global trend in the tropics might be
expected to be towards increased NPP, but changing precipitation
patterns could lead to drought, reducing NPP and increasing fire
frequency in the affected regions. 

3.2.2.4 Effects of increasing atmospheric CO2
CO2 and O2 compete for the reaction sites on the photosynthetic
carbon-fixing enzyme, Rubisco. Increasing the concentration of
CO2 in the atmosphere has two effects on the Rubisco reactions:
increasing  the  rate  of  reaction  with  CO2 (carboxylation)  and
decreasing  the  rate  of  oxygenation.  Both  effects  increase  the
rate  of  photosynthesis, since  oxygenation  is  followed  by
photorespiration  which  releases  CO2 (Farquhar  et  al., 1980).
With  increased  photsynthesis, plants  can  develop  faster,
attaining the same final size in less time, or can increase their
final mass. In the first case, the overall rate of litter production
increases and so the soil carbon stock increases; in the second
case, both  the  below-ground  and  above-ground  carbon  stocks
increase. Both types of growth response to elevated CO2 have
been observed (Masle, 2000). 

The  strength  of  the  response  of  photosynthesis  to  an
increase  in  CO2 concentration  depends  on  the  photosynthetic
pathway  used  by  the  plant. Plants  with  a  photosynthetic
pathway  known  as  C3 (all  trees, nearly  all  plants  of  cold
climates, and most agricultural crops including wheat and rice)
generally show an increased rate of photosynthesis in response
to increases in CO2 concentration above the present level (Koch
and Mooney, 1996; Curtis, 1996; Mooney et al., 1999). Plants
with  the  C4 photosynthetic  pathway  (tropical  and  many
temperate  grasses, some  desert  shrubs, and  some  crops
including maize and sugar cane) already have a mechanism to
concentrate  CO2 and  therefore  show  either  no  direct  photo-
synthetic response, or less response than C3 plants (Wand et al.,
1999).  Increased  CO2 has  also  been  reported  to  reduce  plant
respiration  under  some  conditions  (Drake  et  al., 1999),
although this effect has been questioned.

Increased  CO2 concentration allows  the  partial  closure  of
stomata, restricting  water  loss  during  transpiration  and
producing an increase in the ratio of carbon gain to water loss
(“water-use efficiency”, WUE) (Field et al., 1995a; Drake et al.,
1997; Farquhar, 1997; Körner, 2000). This effect can lengthen
the duration of the growing season in seasonally dry ecosystems
and can increase NPP in both C3 and C4 plants.

Nitrogen-use  efficiency  also  generally  improves  as  carbon
input  increases, because  plants  can  vary  the  ratio  between
carbon and nitrogen in tissues and require lower concentrations
of photosynthetic enzymes in order to carry out photosynthesis

at a given rate; for this reason, low nitrogen availability does not
consistently limit plant responses to increased atmospheric CO2
(McGuire  et  al., 1995;  Lloyd  and  Farquhar, 1996;  Curtis  and
Wang, 1998; Norby et al., 1999; Körner, 2000). Increased CO2
concentration may also stimulate nitrogen fixation (Hungate et
al., 1999; Vitousek and Field, 1999). Changes in tissue nutrient
concentration  may  affect  herbivory  and  decomposition,
although long-term decomposition studies have shown that the
effect  of  elevated  CO2 in  this  respect  is  likely  to  be  small
(Norby and Cortufo, 1998) because changes in the C:N ratio of
leaves are not consistently reflected in the C:N ratio of leaf litter
due to nitrogen retranslocation (Norby et al., 1999). 

The process of CO2 “fertilisation” thus involves direct effects
on  carbon  assimilation  and  indirect  effects  such  as  those  via
water  saving  and  interactions  between  the  carbon  and  nitrogen
cycles. Increasing  CO2 can  therefore  lead  to  structural  and
physiological changes in plants (Pritchard et al., 1999) and can
further affect plant competition and distribution patterns due to
responses of different species. Field studies show that the relative
stimulation of NPP tends to be greater in low-productivity years,
suggesting  that  improvements  in  water-  and  nutrient-use
efficiency  can  be  more  important  than  direct  NPP  stimulation
(Luo et al., 1999).

Although NPP stimulation is not automatically reflected in
increased plant biomass, additional carbon is expected to enter
the soil, via accelerated ontogeny, which reduces lifespan and
results in more rapid shoot death, or by enhanced root turnover
or  exudation  (Koch  and  Mooney, 1996;  Allen  et  al., 2000).
Because the soil microbial community is generally limited by
the  availability  of  organic  substrates, enhanced  addition  of
labile carbon to the soil tends to increase heterotrophic respira-
tion unless inhibited by other factors such as low temperature
(Hungate et al., 1997; Schlesinger and Andrews, 2000). Field
studies  have  indicated  increases  in  soil  organic  matter, and
increases in soil respiration of about 30%, under elevated CO2
(Schlesinger and Andrews, 2000). The potential role of the soil
as a carbon sink under elevated CO2 is crucial to understanding
NEP and long-term carbon dynamics, but remains insufficiently
well understood (Trumbore, 2000).

C3 crops show an average increase in NPP of around 33% for
a  doubling  of  atmospheric  CO2 (Koch  and  Mooney, 1996).
Grassland and crop studies combined show an average biomass
increase  of  14%, with  a  wide  range  of  responses  among
individual studies (Mooney et al., 1999). In cold climates, low
temperatures  restrict  the  photosynthetic  response  to  elevated
CO2.  In  tropical  grasslands  and  savannas, C4 grasses  are
dominant, so  it  has  been  assumed  that  trees  and  C3 grasses
would gain a competitive advantage at high CO2 (Gifford, 1992;
Collatz  et  al., 1998).  This  is  supported  by  carbon  isotope
evidence  from  the  last  glacial  maximum, which  suggests  that
low CO2 favours C4 plants (Street-Perrott et al., 1998). However,
field experiments suggest a more complex picture with C4 plants
sometimes  doing  better  than  C3 under  elevated  CO2 due  to
improved WUE at the ecosystem level (Owensby et al., 1993;
Polley et al., 1996). Highly productive forest ecosystems have
the greatest potential for absolute increases in productivity due
to  CO2 effects.  Long-term  field  studies  on  young  trees  have

196

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

typically  shown  a  stimulation  of  photosynthesis  of  about  60%
for a doubling of CO2 (Saxe et al., 1998; Norby et al., 1999). A
FACE experiment in a fast growing young pine forest showed
an increase of 25% in NPP for an increase in atmospheric CO2
to 560 ppm (DeLucia et al., 1999). Some of this additional NPP
is  allocated  to  root  metabolism  and  associated  microbes;  soil
CO2 efflux increases, returning a part (but not all) of the extra
NPP  to  the  atmosphere  (Allen  et  al., 2000).  The  response  of
mature  forests  to  increases  in  atmospheric  CO2 concentration
has  not  been  shown  experimentally;  it  may  be  different  from
that of young forests for various reasons, including changes in
leaf C:N ratios and stomatal responses to water vapour deficits
as trees mature (Curtis and Wang, 1998; Norby et al., 1999). 

At high CO2 concentrations there can be no further increase
in  photosynthesis  with  increasing  CO2 (Farquhar  et  al., 1980),
except  through  further  stomatal  closure, which  may  produce
continued increases in WUE in water-limited environments. The
shape of the response curve of global NPP at higher CO2 concen-
trations than present is uncertain because the response at the level
of gas exchange is modified by incompletely understood plant-
and  ecosystem-level  processes  (Luo  et  al., 1999).  Based  on
photosynthetic physiology, it is likely that the additional carbon
that could be taken up globally by enhanced photosynthsis as a
direct  consequence  of  rising  atmospheric  CO2 concentration  is
small  at  atmospheric  concentrations  above  800  to  1,000  ppm.
Experimental studies indicate that some ecosystems show greatly
reduced  CO2 fertilisation  at  lower  concentrations  than  this
(Körner, 2000).

3.2.2.5 Effects of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition 
Nitrogen  availability  is  an  important  constraint  on  NPP
(Vitousek et al., 1997), although phosphorus and calcium may
be more important limiting nutrients in many tropical and sub-
tropical regions (Matson, 1999). Reactive nitrogen is released
into the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen oxides (NOx) during
fossil  fuel  and  biomass  combustion  and ammonia  emitted  by
industrial regions, animal husbandry and fertiliser use (Chapter
4). This nitrogen is then deposited fairly near to the source, and
can  act  as  a  fertiliser  for  terrestrial  plants. There  has  been  a
rapid increase in reactive nitrogen deposition over the last 150
years (Vitousek et al., 1997; Holland et al., 1999). Much field
evidence  on  nitrogen  fertilisation  effects  on  plants  (e.g.,
Chapin, 1980; Vitousek and Howarth, 1991; Bergh et al., 1999)
supports the hypothesis that additional nitrogen deposition will
result in increased NPP, including the growth of trees in Europe
(Spiecker  et  al., 1996). There  is  also  evidence  (Fog, 1988;
Bryant et al., 1998) that N fertilisation enhances the formation
of modified soil organic matter and thus increases the residence
time of carbon in soils.

Tracer experiments with addition of the stable isotope 15N
provide insight into the short-term fate of deposited reactive
nitrogen  (Gundersen  et  al., 1998). It  is  clear  from  these
experiments  that  most  of  the  added  N  added  to  the  soil
surface is retained in the ecosystem rather than being leached
out  via  water  transport  or  returned  to  the  atmosphere  in
gaseous  form  (as  N2, NO, N2O  or  NH3).  Studies  have  also
shown  that  the  tracer  is  found  initially  in  the  soil

(Nadelhoffer  et  al., 1999), but  that  it  enters  the  vegetation
after  a  few  years  (Clark  1977;  Schimel  and  Chapin, 1996;
Delgado et al., 1996; Schulze, 2000).

There  is  an  upper  limit  to  the  amount  of  added  N  that  can
fertilise plant growth. This limit is thought to have been reached
in  highly  polluted  regions  of  Europe. With  nitrogen  saturation,
ecosystems are no longer able to process the incoming nitrogen
deposition, and may also suffer from deleterious effects of associ-
ated  pollutants  such  as  ozone  (O3), nutrient  imbalance, and
aluminium toxicity (Schulze et al., 1989; Aber et al., 1998). 

3.2.2.6 Additional impacts of changing atmospheric chemistry
Current  tropospheric  O3 concentrations  in  Europe  and  North
America cause visible leaf injury on a range of crop and tree
species and have been shown to reduce the growth and yield of
crops and young trees in experimental studies. The longer-term
effects  of  O3 on  forest  productivity  are  less  certain, although
significant  negative  associations  between  ozone  exposure  and
forest growth have been reported in North America (Mclaughlin
and Percy, 2000) and in central Europe (Braun et al., 2000). O3
is taken up through stomata, so decreased stomatal conductance
at elevated CO2 may reduce the effects of O3 (Semenov et al.,
1998, 1999). There is also evidence of significant interactions
between O3 and soil water availability in effects on stem growth
or  NPP  from  field  studies  (e.g., Mclaughlin  and  Downing,
1995) and from modelling studies (e.g., Ollinger et al., 1997).
The regional impacts of O3 on NPP elsewhere in the world are
uncertain, although  significant  impacts  on  forests  have  been
reported close to major cities. Fowler et al. (2000) estimate that
the  proportion  of  global  forests  exposed  to  potentially
damaging ozone concentrations will increase from about 25%
in 1990 to about 50% in 2100. 

− and SO4

Other  possible  negative  effects  of  industrially  generated
pollution  on  plant  growth  include  effects  of  soil  acidification
2−. Severe forest decline has
due to deposition of NO3
been  observed  in  regions  with  high  sulphate  deposition, for
instance  in  parts  of  eastern  Europe  and  southern  China.  The
wider  effects  are  less  certain  and  depend  on  soil  sensitivity.
Fowler  et  al. (2000)  estimate  that  8%  of  global  forest  cover
received  an  annual  sulphate  deposition  above  an  estimated
threshold  for  effects  on  acid  sensitive  soils, and  that  this  will
increase to 17% in 2050. The most significant long-term effect
of  continued  acid  deposition  for  forest  productivity  may  be
through  depletion  of  base  cations, with  evidence  of  both
increased  leaching  rates  and  decreased  foliar  concentrations
(Mclaughlin and Percy, 2000), although the link between these
changes in nutrient cycles and NPP needs to be quantified.

3.2.2.7 Additional constraints on terrestrial CO2 uptake
It is very likely that there are upper limits to carbon storage in
ecosystems  due  to  mechanical  and  resource  constraints  on  the
amount  of  above  ground  biomass  and  physical  limits  to  the
amount of organic carbon that can be held in soils (Scholes et al.,
1999). It is also generally expected that increased above-ground
NPP  (production  of  leaves  and  stem)  will  to  some  extent  be
counterbalanced by an increased rate of turnover of the biomass
as upper limits are approached.

3.2.3 Ocean Carbon Processes

3.2.3.1 Background
The  total  amount  of  carbon  in  the  ocean  is  about  50  times
greater  than  the  amount  in  the  atmosphere, and  is  exchanged
with the atmosphere on a time-scale of several hundred years.
Dissolution  in  the  oceans  provides  a  large  sink  for  anthro-
pogenic  CO2, due  in  part  to  its  high  solubility, but  above  all
because of its dissociation into ions and interactions with sea
water constituents (see Box 3.3). 

The  annual  two-way  gross  exchange  of  CO2 between  the
atmosphere and surface ocean is about 90 PgC/yr, mediated by
molecular  diffusion  across  the  air-sea  interface.  Net  CO2
transfer  can  occur  whenever  there  is  a  partial  pressure  differ-
ence of CO2 across this interface. The flux can be estimated as
the product of a gas transfer coefficient, the solubility of CO2,
and  the  partial  pressure  difference  of  CO2 between  air  and
water. The gas transfer coefficient incorporates effects of many
physical  factors  but  is  usually  expressed  as  a  non-linear
function of wind speed alone. There is considerable uncertainty
about  this  function  (Liss  and  Merlivat, 1986;  Wanninkhof,
1992;  Watson  et  al., 1995).  Improvements  in  the  ability  to
measure CO2 transfer directly (e.g., Wanninkhof and McGillis,
1999)  may  lead  to  a  better  knowledge  of  gas  transfer  coeffi-
cients. 

Despite  extensive  global  measurements  conducted  during
the 1990s, measurements of surface water pCO2 remain sparse,
and extensive spatial and temporal interpolation is required in
order to produce global fields. Takahashi et al. (1999) interpo-
lated  data  collected  over  three  decades  in  order  to  derive
monthly  values  of  surface  water  pCO2 over  the  globe  for  a
single “virtual” calendar year (1995). A wind speed dependent

gas transfer coefficient was used to calculate monthly net CO2
fluxes.  The  resulting  estimates, although  subject  to  large
uncertainty, revealed clear regional and seasonal patterns in net
fluxes.

Regional  net  CO2 transfers  estimated  from  contemporary
surface water pCO2 data should not be confused with the uptake
of anthropogenic CO2. The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is the
increase in net transfer over the pre-industrial net transfer, and
is  therefore  superimposed  on  a  globally  varying  pattern  of
relatively  large  natural  transfers.  The  natural  transfers  result
from  heating  and  cooling, and  biological  production  and
respiration. Carbon is transferred within the ocean from natural
sink regions to natural source regions via ocean circulation and
the sinking of carbon rich particles. This spatial separation of
natural sources and sinks dominates the regional distribution of
net annual air-sea fluxes.

CO2 solubility is temperature dependent, hence air-sea heat
transfer contributes to seasonal and regional patterns of air-sea
CO2 transfer  (Watson  et  al., 1995).  Net  cooling  of  surface
waters  tends  to  drive  CO2 uptake;  net  warming  drives
outgassing.  Regions  of  cooling  and  heating  are  linked  via
circulation, producing  vertical  gradients  and  north-south
transports of carbon within the ocean (e.g., of the order 0.5 to 1
PgC/yr southward transport in the Atlantic Basin; Broecker and
Peng, 1992;  Keeling  and  Peng, 1995;  Watson  et  al., 1995;
Holfort et al., 1998). 

Biological processes also drive seasonal and regional distri-
butions of CO2 fluxes (Figure 1c). The gross primary production
by  ocean  phytoplankton  has  been  estimated  by  Bender  et  al.
(1994) to be 103 PgC/yr. Part of this is returned to DIC through
autotrophic  respiration, with  the  remainder  being  net  primary
production, estimated on the basis of global remote sensing data

Box 3.3: The varying CO2 uptake capacity of the ocean.
Because of its solubility and chemical reactivity, CO2 is taken up by the ocean much more effectively than other anthropogenic
gases (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and CH4). CO2 that dissolves in seawater is found in three main forms. The sum of these
forms constitutes dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The three forms are: (1) dissolved CO2 (non-ionic, about 1% of the total) which
−, about
can be exchanged with the atmosphere until the partial pressure in surface water and air are equal, (2) bicarbonate ion (HCO3
2−, about 8%). As atmospheric CO2 increases, the dissolved CO2 content of surface seawater
91%); and (3) carbonate ion (CO3
2− content decreases, since the net
increases at a similar rate, but most of the added CO2 ends up as HCO3
2− to react with further
effect of adding CO2 is a reaction with CO3
CO2 additions, causing an increasing proportion of the added CO2 to remain in its dissolved form. This restricts further uptake, so
that the overall ability of surface sea water to take up CO2 decreases at higher atmospheric CO2 levels. The effect is large. For a
100 ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 above today’s level (i.e., from 370 to 470 ppm) the DIC concentration increase of surface
sea water is already about 40% smaller than would have been caused by a similar 100 ppm increase relative to pre-industrial levels
(i.e., from 280 to 380 ppm). The contemporary DIC increase is about 60% greater than would result if atmospheric CO2 were to
increase from 750 to 850 ppm.

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

to be about 45 PgC/yr (Longhurst et al., 1995; Antoine et al.,
1996; Falkowski et al., 1998; Field et al., 1998; Balkanski et al.,
1999). About 14 to 30% of the total NPP occurs in coastal areas
(Gattuso  et  al., 1998).  The  resulting  organic  carbon  is
consumed  by  zooplankton  (a  quantitatively  more  important
process  than  herbivory  on  land)  or  becomes  detritus.  Some
organic  carbon  is  released  in  dissolved  form  (DOC)  and
oxidised by bacteria (Ducklow, 1999) with a fraction entering
the  ocean  reservoir  as  net  DOC  production  (Hansell  and
Carlson, 1998).  Sinking  of  particulate  organic  carbon  (POC)
composed of dead organisms and detritus together with vertical
transfer of DOC create a downward flux of organic carbon from
the  upper  ocean  known  as  “export  production”.  Recent
estimates for global export production range from roughly 10 to
20  PgC/yr  (Falkowski  et  al., 1998;  Laws  et  al., 2000).  An
alternative estimate for global export production of 11 PgC/yr
has  been  derived  using  an  inverse  model  of  physical  and
chemical data from the world’s oceans (Schlitzer, 2000). Only
a small fraction (about 0.1 PgC) of the export production sinks
in sediments, mostly in the coastal ocean (Gattuso et al., 1998).
Heterotrophic  respiration  at  depth  converts  the  remaining
organic carbon back to DIC. Eventually, and usually at another
location, this  DIC  is  upwelled  into  the  ocean’s  surface  layer
again and may re-equilibrate with the atmospheric CO2. These
mechanisms, often referred to as the biological pump, maintain
higher DIC concentrations at depth and cause atmospheric CO2
concentrations  to  be  about  200  ppm  lower  than  would  be  the
case  in  the  absence  of  such  mechanisms  (Sarmiento  and
Toggweiler, 1984; Maier-Reimer et al., 1996).

Marine  organisms  also  form  shells  of  solid  calcium
carbonate  (CaCO3)  that  sink  vertically  or  accumulate  in
sediments, coral reefs and sands. This process depletes surface
2−, reduces alkalinity, and tends to increase pCO2 and drive
CO3
more  outgassing  of  CO2 (see  Box  3.3  and  Figure  3.1).  The
effect of CaCO3 formation on surface water pCO2 and air-sea
fluxes  is  therefore  counter  to  the  effect  of  organic  carbon
production.  For  the  surface  ocean  globally, the  ratio  between
the  export  of  organic  carbon  and  the  export  of  calcium
carbonate  (the  “rain  ratio”)  is  a  critical  factor  controlling  the
overall  effect  of  biological  activity  on  surface  ocean  pCO2
(Figure 3.1; Archer and Maier-Reimer, 1994). Milliman (1993)
estimated  a  global  production  of  CaCO3 of  0.7  PgC/yr, with
roughly  equivalent  amounts  produced  in  shallow  water  and
surface waters of the deep ocean. Of this total, approximately
60% accumulates in sediments. The rest re-dissolves either in
the water column or within the sediment. An estimate of CaCO3
flux  analogous  to  the  export  production  of  organic  carbon,
however, should include sinking out of the upper layers of the
open ocean, net accumulation in shallow sediments and reefs,
and  export  of  material  from  shallow  systems  into  deep  sea
environments. Based on Milliman’s (1993) budget, this quantity
is about 0.6 PgC/yr (± 25 to 50 % at least). The global average
rain ratio has been variously estimated from models of varying
complexity  to  be  4  (Broecker  and  Peng, 1982), 3.5  to  7.5
(Shaffer, 1993), and 11 (Yamanaka and Tajika, 1996). (It should
be noted that rain ratios are highly depth dependent due to rapid
oxidation of organic carbon at shallow depth compared to the

depths  at  which  sinking  CaCO3 starts  to  dissolve.)  If  one
accepts an organic carbon export production value of 11 PgC/yr
(Schlitzer, 2000), then only Yamanaka and Tajika’s (1996) value
for the rain ratio approaches consistency with the observation-
based  estimates  of  the  export  of  CaCO3 and  organic  carbon
from the ocean surface layer.

The overall productivity of the ocean is determined largely
by  nutrient  supply  from  deep  water.  There  are  multiple
potentially  limiting  nutrients: in  practice  nitrate  and/or
phosphate  are  commonly  limiting  (Falkowski  et  al., 1998;
Tyrell, 1999). Silicate plays a role in limiting specific types of
phytoplankton and hence in determining the qualitative nature
of  primary  production, and  potentially  the  depth  to  which
organic carbon sinks. A role for iron in limiting primary produc-
tivity in regions with detectable phosphate and nitrate but low
productivity  (HNLC  or  “high  nutrient, low  chlorophyll
regions”) has been experimentally demonstrated in the equato-
rial Pacific (Coale et al., 1996) and the Southern Ocean (Boyd
et  al., 2000).  In  both  regions  artificial  addition  of  iron
stimulated  phytoplankton  growth, resulting  in  decreased
surface-water pCO2. In HLNC regions, the supply of iron from
deep water, while an important source, is generally insufficient
to  meet  the  requirements  of  phytoplankton.  An  important
additional  supply  of  iron  to  surface  waters  far  removed  from
sediment and riverine sources is aeolian transport and deposi-
tion (Duce and Tindale, 1991; Fung et al., 2000; Martin, 1990).
This  aeolian  supply  of  iron  may  limit  primary  production  in
HNLC regions, although the effect is ultimately constrained by
the availability of nitrate and phosphate. Iron has been hypoth-
esised  to  play  an  indirect  role  over  longer  time-scales  (e.g.,
glacial-interglacial)  through  limitation  of  oceanic  nitrogen
fixation  and, consequently, the  oceanic  content  of  nitrate
(Falkowski  et  al., 1998;  Broecker  and  Henderson, 1998;  Box
3.4).  The  regional  variability  of  oceanic  nitrogen  fixation
(Gruber and Sarmiento, 1997) and its temporal variability and
potential  climate-sensitivity have  recently  become  apparent
based on results from long time-series and global surveys (Karl
et al., 1997; Hansell and Feely, 2000).

Carbon (organic and inorganic) derived from land also enters
the ocean via rivers as well as to some extent via groundwater.
This transport comprises a natural carbon transport together with
a  significant  anthropogenic  perturbation.  The  global  natural
transport from rivers to the ocean is about 0.8 PgC/yr, half of
which  is  organic  and  half  inorganic  (Meybeck  1982, 1993;
Sarmiento  and  Sundquist  1992;  Figure  3.1). Additional  fluxes
due to human activity have been estimated (Meybeck, 1993) to
be  about  0.1  PgC/yr  (mainly  organic  carbon).  Much  of  the
organic carbon is deposited and/or respired and outgassed close
to  land, mostly  within  estuaries  (Smith  and  Hollibaugh,
1993).The  outgassing  of  anthropogenic  carbon  from  estuaries
can  be  a  significant  term  in  comparison  with  regional  CO2
emissions  estimates  (e.g., 5  to  10%  for  Western  Europe;
Frankignoulle et al., 1998). The natural DIC transport via rivers,
however, is part of a large-scale cycling of carbon between the
open ocean and land associated with dissolution and precipita-
tion  of  carbonate  minerals.  This  natural  cycle  drives  net
outgassing  from  the  ocean  of  the  order  0.6  PgC/yr  globally,

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

199

which should be included in any assessment of net air-sea and
atmosphere-terrestrial  biosphere  transfers  (Sarmiento  and
Sundquist, 1992)  and  ocean  transports  (e.g., Holfort  et  al.,
1998).

3.2.3.2 Uptake of anthropogenic CO2
Despite  the  importance  of  biological  processes  for  the  ocean’s
natural carbon cycle, current thinking maintains that the oceanic
uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2 is  primarily  a  physically  and
chemically  controlled  process  superimposed  on  a  biologically
driven carbon cycle that is close to steady state. This differs from
the situation on land because of the different factors which control
marine and terrestrial primary productivity. On land, experiments
have  repeatedly  shown  that  current  CO2 concentrations  are
limiting  to  plant  growth  (Section  3.2.2.4).  In  the  ocean, experi-
mental evidence is against control of productivity by CO2 concen-
trations, except  for  certain  species  at  lower  than  contemporary
CO2 concentrations  (Riebesell  et  al., 1993;  Falkowski, 1994).
Further, deep ocean concentrations of major nutrients and DIC are
tightly correlated, with the existing ratios closely (but not exactly,
see  Section  3.2.3.3)  matching  the  nutritional  requirements  of
marine  organisms  (the  “Redfield  ratios”: Redfield  et  al., 1963).
This implies that as long as nutrients that are mixed into the ocean
surface layer are largely removed by organic carbon production
and export, then there is little potential to drive a net air-sea carbon
transfer simply through alteration of the global rate of production.
Terrestrial  ecosystems  show  greater  variability  in  this  respect
because land plants have multiple ways to acquire nutrients, and
have greater plasticity in their chemical composition (Melillo and
Gosz, 1983). There are, however, extensive regions of the ocean
surface where major nutrients are not fully depleted, and changes
in these regions may play a significant role in altering atmosphere-
ocean carbon partitioning (see Section 3.2.3.3). 

The increase of atmospheric pCO2 over pre-industrial levels
has tended to increase uptake into natural CO2 sink regions and
decreased release from natural outgassing regions. Contemporary
net air-sea fluxes comprise spatially-varying mixtures of natural
and anthropogenic CO2 flux components and cannot be equated
with anthropogenic CO2 uptake, except on a global scale. Uptake
of anthropogenic CO2 is strongest in regions where “old” waters,
which have spent many years in the ocean interior since their last
contact with the atmosphere, are re-exposed at the sea surface to a
contemporary  atmosphere  which  now  contains  anthropogenic
CO2 (e.g., Sarmiento et al., 1992; Doney, 1999). In an upwelling
region, for example, the natural component of the air-sea flux may
be to outgas CO2 to the atmosphere. The higher atmospheric pCO2
of  the  contemporary  atmosphere  acts  to  reduce  this  outgassing
relative to the natural state, implying that more carbon remains in
the  ocean.  This  represents  uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2 by  a
region which is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. The additional
carbon in the ocean resulting from such uptake is then transported
by the surface ocean circulation, and eventually stored as surface
waters sink, or are mixed, into the deep ocean interior. Whereas
upwelling  into  the  surface  layer  is  quantitatively  balanced  on  a
global scale by sinking, the locations where deep waters rise and
sink can be separated by large horizontal distances. 

Air-sea  gas  transfer  allows  older  waters  to  approach  a  new

steady state with higher atmospheric CO2 levels after about a year
at the sea surface. This is fast relative to the rate of ocean mixing,
implying that anthropogenic CO2 uptake is limited by the rate at
which “older” waters are mixed towards the air-sea interface. The
rate  of  exposure  of  older, deeper  waters  is  therefore  a  critical
factor  limiting  the  uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2.  In  principle,
there is sufficient uptake capacity (see Box 3.3) in the ocean to
incorporate  70  to  80%  of  anthropogenic  CO2 emissions  to  the
atmosphere, even  when  total  emissions  of  up  to  4,500  PgC  are
considered (Archer et al., 1997). The finite rate of ocean mixing,
however, means that it takes several hundred years to access this
capacity  (Maier-Reimer  and  Hasselmann, 1987;  Enting  et  al.,
1994; Archer et al., 1997). Chemical neutralisation of added CO2
through reaction with CaCO3 contained in deep ocean sediments
could potentially absorb a further 9 to 15% of the total emitted
amount, reducing the airborne fraction of cumulative emissions by
about  a  factor  of  2;  however  the  response  time  of  deep  ocean
sediments is in the order of 5,000 years (Archer et al., 1997).

Using  time-series  and  global  survey  data, the  increasing
oceanic carbon content has been directly observed, although the
signal  is  small  compared  to  natural  variability  and  requires
extremely accurate measurements (Sabine et al., 1997). A long-
term  increase  of  surface  water  CO2 levels  tracking  the  mean
atmospheric  CO2 increase  has  been  observed  in  the  ocean’s
subtropical gyres (Bates et al., 1996; Winn et al., 1998) and the
equatorial Pacific (Feely et al., 1999b). However, very few such
time-series  exist  and  the  response  of  other  important  oceanic
regions to the atmospheric pCO2 increase cannot yet be assessed.
Inter-decadal increases in DIC concentrations at depth have been
resolved from direct measurements (Wallace, 1995; Peng et al.,
1998; Ono et al., 1998; Sabine et al., 1999). The total amounts of
anthropogenic  CO2 accumulated  in  the  ocean  since  the  pre-
industrial  era  can  also  be  estimated  from  measurements  using
recent refinements (Gruber et al., 1996) of long-standing methods
for  separating  the  natural  and  anthropogenic  components  of
oceanic DIC. A comparison of such analyses with ocean model
results is presented in Section 3.6.3. 

3.2.3.3 Future changes in ocean CO2 uptake
This section lists processes that may be important for the future
uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2.  These  changes  can  represent
changes in anthropogenic CO2 uptake itself (mainly physical and
chemical processes), or changes in the natural biologically-linked
cycling of carbon between the atmosphere and ocean.

Physical and chemical processes
Buffering  changes.  The  capacity  of  surface  waters  to  take  up
anthropogenic CO2 is decreasing as CO2 levels increase (see Box
3.3). The magnitude of this effect is substantial. This decrease in
uptake  capacity  of  the  ocean  makes  atmospheric  CO2 more
sensitive  to  anthropogenic  emissions  and  other  changes  in  the
natural cycling of carbon.
Emissions rate. Even assuming no other changes to the carbon
cycle, the proportion of emitted CO2 that can be taken up by the
ocean decreases as the rate of emission increases. This is due to
the finite rate of exposure of ‘older’, deeper waters to the anthro-
pogenic CO2 contained in the atmosphere. 

200

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

Warming. CO2 is less soluble in warmer water, and the equilib-
rium pCO2 in seawater increases by about 10 to 20 ppm per °C
temperature increase. Warming of surface water would therefore
tend  to  increase  surface  water  pCO2, driving  CO2 from  the
surface  ocean  to  the  atmosphere.  The  expected  effect  of  such
warming on atmospheric CO2 may be smaller, depending on the
rate  of  exchange  between  ocean  surface  waters  and  the  deep
ocean at high latitudes (e.g., Bacastow, 1993). 
Vertical  mixing  and  stratification. Several  coupled
atmosphere-ocean  models  have  shown  global  warming  to  be
accompanied by an increase in vertical stratification (see Chapter
7).  Such  a  change  would  reduce  the  rate  of  mixing  between
surface  and  deep  waters, and  therefore  reduce  the  effective
volume of the ocean that is exposed to high atmospheric CO2. On
its own, this effect would tend to reduce the ocean CO2 uptake.
However, changes in stratification may also drive changes in the
natural carbon cycle. The magnitude and even the sign of changes
in the natural cycle are much more difficult to predict because of
the complexity of ocean biological processes (Sarmiento et al.,
1998; Matear and Hirst, 1999).

Biologically-linked processes
Qualitative and quantitative changes in carbon uptake arising from
changes in marine ecosystems are more speculative (Denman et
al., 1996; Falkowski et al., 1998; Watson and Liss, 1998), but are
likely  to  have  occurred  over  glacial-interglacial  time-scales
(Section 3.3). Falkowski et al. (1998) listed three major classes of
biologically  linked  factors  that  can  in  principal  alter  the  air-sea
partitioning  of  CO2: (1)  changes  in  surface  nutrient  utilisation
(e.g., in HNLC areas); (2) changes in total ocean content of major
nutrients; (3) changes in the elemental composition of biogenic
material (including the rain ratio). Our incomplete understanding
of present day nutrient controls on productivity limits our ability
to predict future changes in ocean biology and their effect on CO2
levels. For example, the possible identification of changes in deep
ocean C:N:P ratios (Pahlow and Riebesell, 2000) leaves open the
question of the extent to which ocean biological carbon cycling is
in steady state, or is likely to remain so in the future. 
Changes in surface nutrient utilisation. Changes in the utilisa-
tion of surface nutrients in HNLC regions have the potential to
alter export production and carbon storage in the ocean interior.
Most  attention  focuses  on  the  role  of  inadvertent  or  deliberate
changes in the external supply of iron to such regions. The sign of
possible  future  responses  of  ocean  biota  due  to  iron  supply
changes is difficult to assess. Future iron supply may increase due
to erosion (enhanced by agriculture and urbanisation) which tends
to  increase  dust  export  and  aeolian  iron  deposition  (Tegen  and
Fung, 1995). Conversely, a globally enhanced hydrological cycle
and increased water-use efficiency of terrestrial plants may tend to
reduce future dust export (Harrison et al., 2001). The delivery of
dust to the HNLC regions will be sensitive to regional changes in
erosion and the hydrological cycle, affecting the important regions
of  dust  export, rather  than  to  global  scale  changes  (Dai  et  al.,
1998).

Surface nutrient supply could be reduced if ocean stratification
reduces the supply of major nutrients carried to the surface waters
from the deep ocean (Sarmiento et al., 1998). The impact of strati-

fication on marine productivity depends on the limiting factor. In
regions  limited  by  deep  ocean  nutrients, stratification  would
reduce  marine  productivity  and  the  strength  of  the  export  of
carbon  by  biological  processes.  Conversely, stratification  also
increases  the  light  exposure  of  marine  organisms, which  would
increase productivity in regions where light is limiting. 
Changes in total ocean content of major nutrients. Changes in
the delivery of the major biologically limiting nutrients (N, P, Fe,
Si) from riverine, atmospheric or sedimentary sources, or changes
in removal rates (e.g., denitrification), could alter oceanic nutrient
inventories  and  hence  export  production  and  ocean  carbon
storage. On the global scale, the upward fluxes of major nutrients
are slightly depleted in N relative to P with respect to the nutrient
requirements  of  phytoplankton  (Fanning, 1992).  This  relative
supply of N versus P may be sensitive to climate and circulation
related changes in the rate of fixed-nitrogen removal by denitrifi-
cation  (Ganeshram  et  al., 1995)  or  via  changes  in  the  rate  of
nitrogen fixation. Changes in river flow and composition are also
affecting the supply of nutrients (Frankignoulle et al., 1998). The
hypothesised  link  between  nitrogen  fixation  in  certain  ocean
regions and the external iron supply (Falkowski, 1997; Wu et al.,
2000)  could  play  a  role  in  future  nutrient  and  carbon  budgets.
Nitrogen fixation rates may also be affected by changes in strati-
fication and mixing. For example, Karl et al. (1997) have identi-
fied  interannual  variability  in  nitrogen  fixation  rates  in  the  sub-
tropical Pacific which are apparently linked to ENSO variability
in upper ocean dynamics.
Changes  in  the  elemental  composition  of  biogenic  material.
The structure and biogeochemistry of marine ecosystems can be
affected by numerous climate-related factors including tempera-
ture, cloudiness, nutrient  availability, mixed-layer  physics  and
sea-ice  extent.  In  turn  the  structure  of  marine  ecosystems, and
particularly  the  species  composition  of  phytoplankton, exert  a
control on the partitioning of carbon between the ocean and the
atmosphere. For example, a change in distribution of calcareous
versus siliceous planktonic organisms could affect CO2 uptake in
the  future, as  it  may  have  done  in  the  past  (Archer  and  Maier-
Reimer, 1994).  Precipitation  of  CaCO3  by  marine  organisms
2−, thus decreasing surface
(calcification) removes dissolved CO3
water alkalinity and reducing the capacity of sea water to dissolve
atmospheric  CO2 (see  Box  3.3).  Recent  experimental  evidence
suggests  that  as  a  direct  result  of  increasing  atmospheric  and
surface  water  pCO2 levels, oceanic  calcification  will  decrease
significantly  over  the  next  100  years.  Model-based  calculations
suggest that decreases in coral reef calcification rates of the order
17 to 35% relative to pre-industrial rates are possible (Kleypas et
al., 1999). Experimental studies with corals have confirmed such
effects (Langdon et al., 2000). Field and laboratory studies have
shown  that  planktonic  calcification  is  also  highly  sensitive  to
pCO2 levels. The calcification rate of coccolithophorids decreases
by 16 to 83% at pCO2 levels of 750 ppm (Riebesell et al., 2000).
Such  an  effect  would  tend  to  favour  CO2 storage  in  the  upper
ocean and act as a negative feedback on atmospheric growth rates
of  CO2.  However, long-term  predictions  of  such  biological
responses  are  hampered  by  a  lack  of  understanding  concerning
physiological  acclimation  and  genetic  adaptations  of  species  to
increasing pCO2.

3.3 Palaeo CO2 and Natural Changes in the Carbon Cycle

3.3.1 Geological History of Atmospheric CO2

Atmospheric  CO2 concentration  has  varied  on  all  time-scales
during  the  Earth’s  history  (Figure  3.2).  There  is  evidence  for
very  high  CO2 concentrations (>3,000  ppm)  between  600  and
400 Myr BP and between 200 and 150 Myr BP (Figure 3.2f). On
long time-scales, atmospheric CO2 content is determined by the

balance among geochemical processes including organic carbon
burial  in  sediments, silicate  rock  weathering, and  vulcanism
(Berner, 1993, 1997).  In  particular, terrestrial  vegetation  has
enhanced the rate of silicate weathering, which consumes CO2
while  releasing  base  cations  that  end  up  in  the  ocean.
Subsequent  deep-sea  burial  of  Ca  and  Mg  (as  carbonates, for
example  CaCO3)  in  the  shells  of  marine  organisms  removes
CO2. The net effect of slight imbalances in the carbon cycle over
tens  to  hundreds  of  millions  of  years  has  been  to  reduce

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

Box 3.4: Causes of glacial/inter-glacial changes in atmospheric CO2.
One family of hypotheses to explain glacial/inter-glacial variations of atmospheric CO2 relies on physical mechanisms that could
change the dissolution and outgassing of CO2 in the ocean. The solubility of CO2 is increased at low temperature, but reduced at
high salinity. These effects nearly cancel out over the glacial/inter-glacial cycle, so simple solubility changes are not the answer.
Stephens and Keeling (2000) have proposed that extended winter sea ice prevented outgassing of upwelled, CO2-rich water around
the Antarctic continent during glacial times. A melt-water “cap” may have further restricted outgassing of CO2 during summer
(François et al., 1997). These mechanisms could explain the parallel increases of Antarctic temperature and CO2 during deglacia-
tion. However, they require less vertical mixing to occur at low latitudes than is normally assumed. The relative importance of high
and low latitudes for the transport of CO2 by physical processes is not well known, and may be poorly represented in most ocean
carbon models (Toggweiler, 1999; Broecker et al., 1999).

Several authors have hypothesised increased utilisation of surface nutrients by marine ecosystems in high latitudes, leading to
stronger  vertical  gradients  of  DIC  and  thus  reduced  atmospheric  CO2 during  glacial  times  (Sarmiento  and  Toggweiler, 1984;
Siegenthaler and Wenk, 1984; Knox and McElroy, 1984). Other hypotheses call for an increased external supply of nutrients to the
ocean (McElroy, 1983; Martin et al., 1990; Broecker and Henderson, 1998). The supply of iron-rich dust to the Southern Ocean is
increased during glacial periods, due to expanded deserts in the Patagonian source region (Andersen et al., 1998; Mahowald et al.,
1999; Petit et al., 1999); dust-borne iron concentration in Antarctic ice is also increased (Edwards et al., 1998). Fertilisation of
marine productivity by iron from this source could have influenced atmospheric CO2. Most of these mechanisms, however, can only
account for about 30 ppm, or less, of the change (Lefèvre and Watson, 1999; Archer and Johnson, 2000). Palaeo-nutrient proxies
have also been used to argue against large changes in total high latitude productivity (Boyle, 1988; Rickaby and Elderfield, 1999;
Elderfield and Rickaby, 2000), even if the region of high productivity in the Southern Ocean may have been shifted to the north
(Kumar et al., 1995; François et al., 1997). Increased productivity over larger regions might have been caused by decreased denitri-
fication (Altabet et al., 1995; Ganeshram et al., 1995) or iron stimulated N2 fixation (Broecker and Henderson, 1998) leading to an
increase in the total ocean content of reactive nitrogen.

Another family of hypotheses invokes ocean alkalinity changes by a variety of mechanisms (Opdyke and Walker, 1992; Archer
and Maier-Reimer, 1994; Kleypas, 1997), including increased silica supply through dust, promoting export production by siliceous
rather than calcareous phytoplankton (Harrison, 2000). Although there is geochemical evidence for higher ocean pH during glacial
times (Sanyal et al., 1995), a large increase in alkalinity would result in a much deeper lysocline, implying an increase in CaCO3
preservation that is not observed in deep-sea sediments (Catubig et al., 1998; Sigman et al., 1998; Archer et al., 2000).

Given the complex timing of changes between climate changes and atmospheric CO2 on glacial-interglacial time-scales, it is
plausible that more than one mechanism has been in operation; and indeed most or all of the hypotheses encounter difficulties if
called upon individually to explain the full magnitude of the change.

atmospheric CO2. The rates of these processes are extremely slow,
hence  they  are  of  limited  relevance  to  the  atmospheric  CO2
response to emissions over the next hundred years.

It is pertinent, however, that photosynthesis evolved at a time
when  O2 concentrations  were  far  less  than  at  present.  O2 has
accumulated  in  the  atmosphere  over  geological  time  because
photosynthesis results in the burial of reduced chemical species:
pyrite (FeS2) derived from sulphur-reducing bacteria, and organic
carbon.  This  accumulation  has  consequences  for  terrestrial  and
marine ecosystems today. Primary production is carbon limited in
terrestrial ecosystems in part because of (geologically speaking)
low CO2 concentrations, and in part because Rubisco (the enzyme
that fixes CO2 in all plants) also has an affinity for O2 that reduces
its  efficiency  in  photosynthesis  (see  Section  3.2.2.4). Primary
production  is  iron  limited  in  some  marine  ecosystems  mainly
because  of  the  extreme  insolubility  of  Fe(III), the  predominant
form of iron in the present, O2-rich environment. These difficulties
faced  by  contemporary  organisms  represent  a  legacy  of  earlier
evolution under very different biogeochemical conditions.

In  more  recent  times, atmospheric  CO2 concentration
continued to fall after about 60 Myr BP and there is geochemical
evidence that concentrations were <300 ppm by about 20 Myr BP

(Pagani  et  al., 1999a;  Pearson  and  Palmer, 1999, 2000;  Figure
3.2e). Low CO2 concentrations may have been the stimulus that
favoured the evolution of C4 plants, which increased greatly in
abundance between 7 and 5 Myr BP (Cerling et al., 1993, 1997;
Pagani  et  al., 1999b). Although  contemporary  CO2 concentra-
tions  were  exceeded  during  earlier  geological  epochs, they  are
likely  higher  now  than  at  any  time  during  the  past  20  million
years.

3.3.2 Variations in Atmospheric CO2 during Glacial/inter-

glacial Cycles

The  purity  of  Antarctic  ice  allows  the  CO2 concentration  in
trapped  air  bubbles  to  be  accurately  measured  (Tschumi  and
Stauffer, 2000). The CO2 record from the Vostok ice core is the
best available for the glacial/inter-glacial time-scale and covers the
past four glacial/inter-glacial cycles (420 kyr) with a resolution of
1 to 2 kyr (Petit et al., 1999; Fischer et al., 1999). The general
pattern is clear (Figure 3.2d): atmospheric CO2 has been low (but
≥  180  ppm)  during  glacial  periods, and  higher  (but ≤300  ppm)
during  interglacials.  Natural  processes  during  the  glacial-
interglacial  cycles  have  maintained  CO2 concentrations  within

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

203

these bounds, despite considerable variability on multi-millenial
time-scales. The present CO2 concentration is higher than at any
time during the 420 kyr period covered by the Vostok record.

The  terrestrial  biosphere  stores  300  to  700  Pg  more carbon
during interglacial periods than during glacial periods, based on a
widely  accepted  interpretation  of  the  δ13C  record  in  deep-sea
sediments (Shackleton, 1977; Bird et al., 1994; Crowley, 1995).
Terrestrial  modelling  studies  (e.g., Friedlingstein  et  al., 1995b;
Peng et al., 1998) have reached the same conclusion. Thus, the
terrestrial biosphere does not cause the difference in atmospheric
CO2 between glacial and interglacial periods. The cause must lie
in the ocean, and indeed the amount of atmospheric change to be
accounted for must be augmented to account for a fraction of the
carbon transferred between the land and ocean. The mechanism
remains  controversial  (see  Box  3.4).  In  part  this  is  because  a
variety of processes that could be effective in altering CO2 levels
on a century time-scale can be largely cancelled on multi-millenial
time-scales by changes in CaCO3 sedimentation or dissolution, as
discussed in Section 3.2.3.1.

Orbital variations (Berger, 1978) are the pacemaker of climate
change  on  multi-millenial  time-scales  (Hays  et  al., 1976).
Atmospheric  CO2 is  one  of  many  Earth  system  variables  that
show the characteristic “Milankovitch” periodicities, and has been
implicated as a key factor in locking natural climate changes to the
100  kyr  eccentricity  cycle  (Shackleton, 2000).  Whatever  the
mechanisms involved, lags of up to 2,000 to 4,000 years in the
drawdown of CO2 at the start of glacial periods suggests that the
low CO2 concentrations during glacial periods amplify the climate
change but do not initiate glaciations (Lorius and Oeschger, 1994;
Fischer et al., 1999). Once established, the low CO2 concentration
is likely to have enhanced global cooling (Hewitt and Mitchell,
1997).  During  the  last  deglaciation, rising  CO2 paralleled
Southern  Hemisphere  warming  and  was  ahead  of  Northern
Hemisphere warming (Chapter 2). 

During  glacial  periods, the  atmospheric  CO2 concentration
does  not  track  the  “fast” changes  in  climate  (e.g., decade  to
century  scale  warming  events)  associated  with  Dansgaard-
Oeschger events, although there are CO2 fluctuations of up to 20
ppm associated with the longer-lived events (Stauffer et al., 1998;
Indermühle et al., 2000) (see Chapter 2 for explanations of these
terms). During the last deglaciation, atmospheric CO2 concentra-
tion continued to increase, by about 12 ppm, through the Younger
Dryas  cold  reversal  (12.7  to  11.6  kyr  BP)  seen  in  Northern
Hemisphere palaeoclimate records (Fischer et al., 1999; Smith et
al., 1999). Palaeo-oceanographic evidence shows that the Younger
Dryas event was marked by a prolonged shut-down of the thermo-
haline circulation, which is likely to have been triggered by the
release of melt water into the North Atlantic. Similar behaviour,
with  a  slight  rise  in  CO2 accompanying  a  major  Northern
Hemisphere cooling and shutdown of North Atlantic Deep Water
production, has  been  produced  in  a  coupled  atmosphere-ocean
model (Marchal et al., 1998). The observed CO2 rise during the
Younger Dryas period was modest, suggesting that atmospheric
CO2 has, under  natural  conditions, been  well  buffered  against
abrupt changes in climate, including thermohaline collapse. This
buffering is a direct consequence of the large reservoir of DIC in
the ocean. 

3.3.3 Variations in Atmospheric CO2 during the Past 11,000 

Years

Natural  variations  in  CO2 during  the  past  11,000  years  (Figure
3.2c)  have  been  small  (about  20  ppm)  according  to  the  best
available measurements, which are from the Taylor Dome ice core
(Smith et al., 1999; Indermühle et al., 1999). These measurements
show  a  short-lived  maximum  around  11  kyr  BP, followed  by  a
slight  fall, which  may  have  been  caused  by  increasing  carbon
storage in the terrestrial biosphere. Atmospheric CO2 concentra-
tion was about 260 ppm at its Holocene minimum around 8 kyr
BP  and  increased  towards  about  280  ppm  in  the  pre-industrial
period. The same pattern and the same CO2 concentration levels
over the past 8 kyr have also been shown in another ice core, BH7
near Vostok (Peybernès et al., 2000). The causes of these changes
are  not  known.  Preliminary  δ13C  measurements  (see  Box  3.6)
suggest  that  this  increase  may  have  been  due  to  a  gradual
reduction  in  terrestrial  carbon  storage  (Indermühle  et  al., 1999;
Smith et al., 1999) but others have considered an oceanic explana-
tion more likely.

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have also been reconstructed
indirectly, from stomatal index measurements on sub-fossil leaves
(Van de Water et al., 1994; Beerling et al., 1995; Rundgren and
Beerling, 1999;  Wagner  et  al., 1999).  Stomatal  density  and
stomatal  index  of  many  species  respond  to  atmospheric  CO2
(Woodward, 1987;  Woodward  and  Bazzaz, 1988)  but  are
influenced by other environmental variables as well (Poole et al.,
1996). One recent stomatal index record, interpreted as implying
high (up to 350 ppm) and rapidly fluctuating CO2 concentrations
in the early Holocene (Wagner et al., 1999), is clearly incompat-
ible with the ice core record of Indermühle et al. (1999), whereas
a  continuous  stomatal  index  record  from  9  kyr  BP  onwards
(Rundgren  and  Beerling, 1999)  has  shown  concentration  trends
consistent with the ice-core records. 

Figure  3.2b  shows  the  excellent  agreement  among  different
high-resolution Antarctic ice cores covering the past 1,000 years.
Atmospheric CO2 concentration fell by about 8 to 10 ppm during
the  Little  Ice Age  (from  1280  to  1860, see  Chapter  2)  (Figure.
3.2b, c; Barnola et al., 1995; Etheridge et al., 1996; Indermühle et
al., 1999;  Rundgren  and  Beerling, 1999). A  slight  contempora-
neous increase in δ13C of atmospheric CO2 has led to the sugges-
tion  that  this  effect  was  caused  by  enhanced  carbon  storage  on
land (Francey et al., 1999b; Trudinger et al., 1999).

3.3.4 Implications

The Vostok record of atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic climate is
consistent  with  a  view  of  the  climate  system  in  which  CO2
concentration  changes  amplify  orbitally-induced  climate
changes on glacial/inter-glacial time-scales (Shackleton, 2000).
Changes during the present inter-glacial (until the start of the
anthropogenic  CO2 rise)  have  been  small  by  comparison.
Although complete explanations for these changes in the past
are lacking, high-resolution ice core records establish that the
human-induced  increase  of  atmospheric  CO2 over  the  past
century  is  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude  faster  than  has
occurred during the preceeding 20,000 years.

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

3.4 Anthropogenic Sources of CO2

3.4.1 Emissions from Fossil Fuel Burning and Cement 

Production

Current  anthropogenic  emissions  of  CO2 are  primarily  the
result  of  the  consumption  of  energy  from  fossil  fuels.
Estimates of annual global emissions from fossil fuel burning
and  cement  production  have  been  made  for  the  period  from
1751 through 1999. Figure 3.3 summarises emissions over the
period from 1959 to 1999 (Keeling and Whorf, 2000).

Estimates  of  annual  global  emissions  from  fossil  fuel
burning and cement production by Marland et al. (2000) span
the period from 1751 through to 1997, reaching a maximum in
1997  of  6.6  PgC/yr  (0.2  PgC/yr  of  this  was  from  cement
production).  The  primary  data  for  these  estimates  are  annual
energy  statistics  compiled  by  the  United  Nations  (2000).
Emissions  for  1998  and  1999  have  been  estimated  based  on
energy  statistics  compiled  by  British  Petroleum  (2000).
Emission  factors  (IPCC, 1997)  were  applied  to  consumption
statistics (British Petroleum, 2000) to calculate emissions over
the period 1990 to 1999. Emissions were then scaled to match
the estimates for emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement
production from Marland et al. (2000) over the overlap period
from  1990  to  1997. The  scaled  emission  estimates, therefore,
implicitly include emissions from cement production. 

The  average  value  of  emissions  for  the  1980s  given  by
Marland  et  al.  (2000)  is  5.44 ± 0.3  PgC/yr, revised  from  the
earlier  estimate  (Marland  et  al.  1994; Andres  et  al.  2000)  of
5.46 ± 0.3 PgC/yr used in the SAR and in the Special Report
on  Radiative  Forcing  (IPCC, 1994)  (hereafter  SRRF).
Estimated  emissions  rose  from  6.1  PgC/yr  in  1990  to  6.5
PgC/yr in 1999. The average value of emissions in the 1990s
was 6.3 ± 0.4 PgC/yr.
3.4.2 Consequences of Land-use Change

About 10 to 30% of the current total anthropogenic emissions
of CO2 are estimated to be caused by land-use conversion. Such
estimates rely on land cover data sets which are highly variable,
and  estimates  of  average  carbon  density  of  vegetation  types,
which  are  also  highly  variable  with  stand  age  and  local
conditions  (see  Box  3.1).  Hence  they  cannot  be  specified  as
accurately  as  is  possible  for  fossil  fuel  emissions.  Historical
emissions are treated in Section 3.2.2.2; this section focuses on
the contemporary situation.

Net land-use flux, comprising the balance of positive terms
due  to  deforestation  and  negative  terms  due  to  regrowth  on
abandoned agricultural land, has been estimated based on land-
use statistics and simple models of rates of decomposition and
regrowth, excluding  possible  climate, CO2 and  N  fertilisation
effects  (Houghton, 1999). Not  all  land-use  emissions  are
included, for  example  mining  of  peatlands.  The  analysis  of
Houghton  (1999)  indicated  that  the  net  flux  due  to  land-use
change was 2.0 ± 0.8 PgC/yr during the 1980s, almost entirely
due to deforestation of tropical regions. Temperate forests were
found to show an approximate balance between carbon uptake
in  regrowing  forests  and  carbon  lost  in  oxidation  of  wood

Houghton and Hackler’s (1995) earlier estimate of 1.6 PgC/yr
for the same period, which was used in the SAR, because of a
reanalysis  of  data  from  tropical Asia  (Houghton  and  Hackler,
1999).  However, other  recent  analyses  by  the  same  authors
reduce the estimated emissions from the Brazilian Amazon by
half  (Houghton  et  al., 2000), and  point  to  other  previously
unaccounted  for  sinks  of  carbon  in  the  USA  such  as  fire
suppression  and  woody  encroachment, and  changes  in  the
management  of  agricultural  soils  (Houghton  et  al., 1999).
Consideration of these additional studies brings the overall total
back down to 1.7 ± 0.8 PgC/yr (Houghton, 2000), as given in
the SRLULUCF.

An independent analysis (see Section 3.6.2.2) by the Carbon
Cycle  Model  Linkage  Project  (CCMLP)  also  calculated  the
marginal  effects  of  land-use  changes  on  the  global  terrestrial
carbon  budget  (McGuire  et  al., 2001).  Land-use  change  data
(conversions between native vegetation and crops) were derived
from Ramankutty and Foley (2000). The estimates obtained for
net  land-use  flux  during  the  1980s  were  between  0.6  and  1.0
PgC/yr, i.e., substantially smaller than the fluxes calculated by
Houghton (1999). The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear.
The CCMLP estimates may be too low because they neglected
conversions  to  pasture.  However, data  presented  in  Houghton
(1999)  indicate  that  the  main  changes  during  recent  decades
were due to land conversion for crops. A more important differ-
ence may lie in the timing of deforestation in different regions
in the tropics, where Ramankutty and Foley (2000) show higher
overall  rates  in  the  1970s  and  lower  rates  in  the  1980s  than
Houghton does (1999).

Box 3.5: The use of O2 measurements to assess the fate of fossil fuel CO2.
The amount of CO2 that remains in the atmosphere each year has been consistently less than the amount emitted by fossil fuel
burning. This is because some CO2 dissolves and mixes in the ocean, and some is taken up by the land. These two modes of uptake
have  different  effects  on  the  concentration  of  O2 in  the  atmosphere.  Fossil  fuel  burning  consumes  O2 and  causes  a  decline  in
atmospheric O2 concentration (Figure 3.4). Dissolution of CO2 in the ocean has no effect on atmospheric O2. Terrestrial uptake of
CO2, by contrast, implies that photosynthesis (which releases O2) is exceeding respiration and other oxidation processes, including
fire (which consume O2). Thus, net terrestrial uptake of CO2 implies a net release of O2, in a known stochiometric ratio. This differ-
ence can be used to partition the total CO2 uptake into land and ocean components, as shown graphically in Figure 3.4. Strictly
speaking, the  atmospheric  O2  –  CO2 budget  method  can  only  distinguish  between  net  non-biological  ocean  uptake  and  net
biospheric uptake, which in principle includes both the terrestrial and the marine biosphere. However, since biological oxygen
uptake is not expected to have changed significantly during recent decades because of nutrient limitations in most parts of the ocean
(see Section 3.2.3.2), this inferred biospheric uptake is attributed to the land.

Measurement of changes in O2 presents a technical challenge because changes of a few ppm caused by fossil fuel burning have
to be determined against a background concentration of 209,000 ppm (about 21%). For technical reasons, O2 is measured relative
to N2, the main constituent of the atmosphere, as a reference gas. For simplicity this chapter refers to O2 concentrations, although
strictly it is O2 : N2 ratios that are measured. The impact of nitrification-denitrification changes on atmospheric N2 content are
assumed not to be problematic because they are small and the inventory of N2 is very large. Increases in ocean temperatures (Levitus
et al., 2000), because of their effect on the temperature dependent solubility, induce small outgassing fluxes of O2 and N2 (Keeling
et al., 1993) that have to be taken into account (see Figure 3.4) although their magnitude is only approximately known. Impacts on
atmospheric O2 caused by changes in the ventilation of deeper, oxygen depleted waters have been observed on interannual time-
scales (Keeling et al., 1993, Bender  et al., 1996). They could also occur on longer time-scales, e.g., through increased ocean strati-
fication induced by ocean warming.

Another analysis calculated a substantially higher net source
due to land-use change in the tropics of 2.4 ± 1.0 PgC/yr during
the  1980s  (Fearnside, 2000).  This  analysis  did  not  deal  with
temperate regions, and is not used in the global budget estimates. 
No  complete  global  assessment  of  deforestation  effects
covering the 1990s is available. Rates of deforestation appear to
be declining. The FAO (1997) tropical forest assessment reported
annual losses of 15.5×106 ha in the 1980s, and 13.7×106 ha in
1990 to 1995. Independent studies show a significant decline in
deforestation  rates  in  the  Amazon  region  (Skole  and  Tucker,
1993; Fearnside, 2000). The annual flux of carbon from land-use
change for the period from 1990 to 1995 has been estimated to be
1.6  PgC/yr from  1990  to  1995, consisting  of  a  source  of  1.7
PgC/yr in the tropics and a small sink in temperate and boreal
areas (Houghton, 2000).

3.5 Observations, Trends and Budgets

3.5.1 Atmospheric Measurements and Global CO2 Budgets

Continuous  time-series  of  highly  precise  measurements  of  the
atmospheric  composition  are  of  central  importance  to  current
understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. CO2 has been
measured at the Mauna Loa and South Pole stations since 1957
(Keeling et al., 1995; Figure 3.2a), and through a global surface
sampling  network  developed  in  the  1970s  that  is  becoming
progressively more extensive and better inter-calibrated (Conway
et al., 1994; Keeling et al., 1995). Associated measurements of
δ13C  in  atmospheric  CO2 began  in  1977  (Francey  et  al., 1995,
Keeling et al., 1995, Trolier et al., 1996). More recently, comple-

mentary information has been available from O2 concentrations
(measured  as  ratios  of  O2:N2, see  Box  3.5), which  have  been
regularly  measured  since  the  early  1990s  (Keeling  and  Shertz,
1992; Keeling et al., 1993; Bender et al., 1996; Keeling et al.,
1996b;  Battle  et  al., 2000;  Manning, 2001;  Figure  3.2a).  O2
concentration  data  for  the  1980s  have  been  gleaned  by  two
methods: sampling  of  archived  air  flasks  that  were  collected
during the 1980s (Langenfelds et al., 1999), and measuring the
air trapped in Antarctic firn (Battle et al., 1996). 

In addition to fossil fuel CO2 emissions, Figure 3.3 shows
the  observed  seasonally  corrected  growth  rate  of  the
atmospheric  CO2 concentrations, based  on  the  two  longest
running  atmospheric  CO2 recording  stations  (Keeling  and
Whorf, 2000). It is evident from this comparison that a part of
the anthropogenic CO2 has not remained in the atmosphere; in
other words, CO2 has been taken up by the land or the ocean or
both.  This  comparison  also  shows  that  there  is  considerable
interannual variability in the total rate of uptake. 

O2 and CO2 measurements are used here to provide observa-
tionally-based  budgets  of  atmospheric  CO2 (Table  3.1).  CO2
budgets  are  presented  here  (Table  3.1)  for  the  1980s  (for
comparison with previous work; Table 3.3), and for the 1990s.
The reported error ranges are based on uncertainties of global
fossil  fuel  emissions, determination  of  the  decadal  average
changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, and O2:N2 ratio;
and uncertainties in the assumed O2:CO2 stoichiometric ratios
in  the  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  and  in  photosynthesis  and
respiration. The error ranges reflect uncertainties of the decadal
mean  averaged  values;  they  do  not  reflect  interannual
variability  in  annual  values, which  far  exceeds  uncertainty  in

Figure 3.4: Partitioning of fossil fuel CO2 uptake using O2 measurements (Keeling and Shertz, 1992; Keeling et al., 1993; Battle et al., 1996,
2000; Bender et al., 1996; Keeling et al., 1996b; Manning, 2001). The graph shows the relationship between changes in CO2 (horizontal axis) and
O2 (vertical axis). Observations of annual mean concentrations of O2, centred on January 1, are shown from the average of the Alert and La Jolla
monitoring stations (Keeling et al., 1996b; Manning, 2001; solid circles) and from the average of the Cape Grim and Point Barrow monitoring
stations (Battle et al., 2000; solid triangles). The records from the two laboratories, which use different reference standards, have been shifted to
optimally match during the mutually overlapping period. The CO2 observations represent global averages compiled from the stations of the
NOAA network (Conway et al., 1994) with the methods of Tans et al. (1989). The arrow labelled “fossil fuel burning” denotes the effect of the
combustion of fossil fuels (Marland et al., 2000; British Petroleum, 2000) based on the relatively well known O2:CO2 stoichiometric relation of
the different fuel types (Keeling, 1988). Uptake by land and ocean is constrained by the known O2:CO2 stoichiometric ratio of these processes,
defining the slopes of the respective arrows. A small correction is made for differential outgassing of O2 and N2 with the increased temperature of
the ocean as estimated by Levitus et al. (2000).

Box 3.6: Stable carbon isotopes in atmospheric CO2.
δ13C, a measure of the relative abundance of the two stable carbon isotopes, 13C and 12C, in atmospheric CO2 gives in principle
similar possibilities to O2 for the partitioning of atmospheric CO2 uptake (Keeling et al., 1979, 1980; Mook et al., 1983; Keeling
et al., 1989; Francey et al., 1995; Keeling et al., 1995). The principle of using δ13C to separate land and ocean components of the
carbon budget relies on the fractionation during photosynthesis by C3 plants, which discriminates against 13C. This fractionation
leads to biospheric carbon being depleted in 13C by about 18‰ relative to the atmosphere. In contrast, exchanges with the ocean
involve relatively small fractionation effects. Changes in the 13C/12C ratio of atmospheric CO2 thus indicate the extent to which
concurrent CO2 variations can be ascribed to variations in biospheric uptake. The calculation also requires specification of the
turnover times of carbon in the ocean and on land, because fossil fuel burning implies a continuous release of isotopically light
carbon to the atmosphere. This leads to a lowering of the atmospheric 13C/12C isotope ratio, which takes years to centuries to work
its way through the carbon cycle (Keeling et al., 1980; Tans et al., 1993; Ciais et al., 1995a,b).

There are some complications. C3 plants discriminate against 13C more strongly than C4 plants (Lloyd and Farquhar, 1994), thus
the distributions of C3 and C4 photosynthesis need to be known. The oceanic disequilibrium can in principle be estimated observa-
tionally (Tans et al., 1993; Heimannn and Maier-Reimer, 1996; Bacastow et al., 1996; Gruber et al., 1999), while the terrestrial
disequilibrium has to be estimated by means of models (e.g., Ciais et al., 1999). Langenfelds et al. (1999) and Battle et al. (2000)
have shown that recently estimated values for the disequilibrium terms lead to consistency between the partitioning of CO2 uptake
into land and ocean uptake based on O2 and on δ13C measurements.

the  decadal  mean  rate  of  increase, as  is  further  discussed  in
Section 3.5.2. The salient facts are as follows:

• During the 1980s, fossil fuel emissions were on average 5.4 ± 0.3
PgC/yr  and  atmospheric  CO2 content  increased  on  average  by
3.3 ± 0.1 PgC/yr. Partitioning of CO2 uptake was estimated based
on archived flask O2 measurements (Langenfelds et al., 1999) for
the 1979 to 1997 period, taking the O2 trend during 1991 to 1997
(Battle et al., 2000) into account. The resulting estimate of the
ocean-atmosphere flux was −1.9 ± 0.6 PgC/yr and of the land-
atmosphere flux −0.2 ± 0.7 PgC/yr. This partitioning is adopted
here in Table 3.1. It is corroborated by independent O2 measure-
ments  in  Antarctic  firn  (Battle  et  al., 1996).  Restricting  the
analysis  to  the  Battle  et  al. (1996)  data  for  the  1980  to  1989
period, an  ocean-atmosphere  flux  of  −1.8  ± 1.0  PgC/yr  and  a
land-atmosphere flux of −0.4 ± 1.0 PgC/yr were obtained, i.e.,
results indistinguishable from the values in Table 3.1. 

• Despite a greater emission rate of 6.3 ± 0.4 PgC/yr (see Section
3.4.1), the average atmospheric increase during the 1990s was
3.2 ± 0.1 PgC/yr, i.e., about the same as during the 1980s. An
exceptionally low rate of increase during the early 1990s was
balanced  by  a  high  rate  during  the  late  1990s.  Based  on  the
longest  existing  O2 records  from  La  Jolla  (California, USA)
and Alert (northern Canada) (Keeling et al., 1996b; Manning,
2001;  see  Figure  3.4), the  ocean-atmosphere flux  during  the
1990s was −1.7 ± 0.5 PgC/yr and the land-atmosphere flux was
−1.4 ± 0.7 PgC/yr.

Ocean uptake in the 1980s as estimated from O2 and CO2 measure-
ments thus agrees with the estimates in the SRRF (Schimel et al.,
1995)  and  the  SAR  (Schimel  et  al., 1996)  (although  these  were
model-based estimates; this section presents only observationally-
based  estimates  (Table  3.3)).  Considering  the  uncertainties, the
ocean sink in the 1990s was not significantly different from that in

the  1980s.  The  land-atmosphere  flux  was  close  to  zero  in  the
1980s, as  also  implied  by  the  SAR  budget. The  land  appears  to
have taken up more carbon during the 1990s than during the 1980s.
The  causes  cannot  yet  be  reliably  quantified, but  possible
mechanisms include a slow down in deforestation (Section 3.4.2),
and climate variability that resulted in temporarily increased land
and/or  ocean  uptake  in  the  early  1990s  (Section  3.5.2).  These
budgets  are  consistent  with  information  from  atmospheric  δ13C
measurements  (see  Box  3.6  and  Table  3.4)  and  with  budgets
presented  in  the  SRLULUCF  (Bolin  et  al. 2000)  except  that
estimated  ocean  uptake  is  smaller, and  land  uptake  accordingly
larger, than given in the SRLULUCF (see Table 3.3, footnote i).

Several  alternative  approaches  to  estimating  the  ocean-
atmosphere and land-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 are summarised
in Table 3.4. Alternative methods for estimating the global ocean-
atmosphere  flux, based  on  surface-water  pCO2 measurements
and  ocean δ13C  changes  (Quay  et  al., 1992; Tans  et  al., 1993,
Heimann  and  Maier-Reimer, 1996;  Sonnerup  et  al., 1999),
respectively, have  yielded  a  range  of  −1.5  to  −2.8  PgC/yr  (for
various recent periods). The total anthropogenic CO2 added to the
ocean since pre-industrial times can also be estimated indirectly
using oceanic observations (Gruber et al., 1996). A global value
of 107 ± 27 PgC by 1990 can be estimated from the basin-scale
values of 40 ± 9 PgC for the Atlantic in the 1980s (Gruber, 1998),
20 ± 3 PgC for the Indian Ocean in 1995 (Sabine et al., 1999),
and  the  preliminary  value  of  45  PgC  for  the  Pacific  Ocean  in
1990 to 1996 (Feely et al., 1999a) with a large uncertainty of the
order of ± 15 PgC. Assuming that accumulation of CO2 in the
ocean follows a curve similar to the (better known) accumulation
in the atmosphere, the value for the ocean-atmosphere flux for
1980 to 1989 would be between −1.6 and −2.7 PgC/yr. Although
each individual method has large uncertainty, all of these ocean-
based  measurements  give  results  comparable  with  the  fluxes
presented in Table 3.1. Consideration of model-based estimates
of ocean uptake in Table 3.4 is deferred to Section 3.6.2.2.

i Based on an ocean carbon cycle model (Jain et al., 1995) used in the IPCC SAR (IPCC, 1996; Harvey et al., 1997), tuned to yield an ocean-

atmosphere flux of 2.0 PgC/yr in the 1980s for consistency with the SAR. After re-calibration to match the mean behaviour of OCMIP models
and taking account of the effect of observed changes in temperature aon CO2 and solubility, the same model yields an ocean-atmosphere flux of
−1.7 PgC/yr for the 1980s and  −1.9 PgC/yr for 1989 to 1998.
j Based on annual average estimated emissions for 1989 to 1995 (Houghton, 2000).

The  land-atmosphere  flux  based  on  atmospheric  measure-
ments represents the balance of a net land-use flux (currently a
positive flux, or carbon source, dominated by tropical deforesta-
tion) and a residual component which is, by inference, a negative
flux  or  carbon  sink.  Using  the  land-atmosphere  flux  estimates
from Table 3.1, assuming that land-use change contributed +1.7
PgC/yr to the atmosphere during the 1980s (Section 3.4.2), then
a residual terrestrial flux of −1.9 PgC/yr (i.e., a residual sink of
similar magnitude to the total ocean uptake) is required for mass
balance. This is the term popularly (and misleadingly) known as
the “missing sink”. The central estimate of its magnitude agrees
with  previous  analyses, e.g., in  the  SAR  (if “northern  forest
regrowth” is  combined  with  “residual  terrestrial  sink” terms  in
the  SAR  budget;  Schimel  et  al., 1996)  and  the  SRLULUCF
(Bolin  et  al., 2000)  (Table  3.3).  The  uncertainty  around  this
number  is  rather  large, however, because  it  compounds  the
uncertainty in the atmospheric budget with a major uncertainty
about changes in land use. Using an error range corresponding
to 90% confidence intervals around the atmospheric estimate of
−0.2  PgC/yr  (i.e., 1.6σ, giving  confidence  intervals  of  ±1.1
PgC/yr), and taking the range of estimates for CO2 released due
to  land-use  change  during  the  1980s  from  Section  3.4.2, the
residual terrestrial sink is estimated to range from −3.8 to +0.3
PgC/yr for the 1980s. Model-based analysis of the components of
the  residual  terrestrial  sink  (Table  3.4)  is  discussed  in  Section
3.6.2.2.

3.5.2 Interannual Variability in the Rate of Atmospheric CO2

Increase

The rate of increase in the globally averaged atmospheric concen-
tration of CO2 varies greatly from year to year. “Fast” and “slow”
years have differed by 3 to 4 PgC/yr within a decade (Figure 3.3).
This variability cannot be accounted for by fossil fuel emissions,
which do not show short-term variability of this magnitude. The
explanation must lie in variability of the land-atmosphere flux or
the  ocean-atmosphere  flux  or  both. Variability  in  both  systems
could be induced by climate variability.

An association between CO2 variability and El Niño in partic-
ular  has  been  reported  for  over  twenty  years  and  has  been
confirmed by recent statistical analyses (Bacastow, 1976; Keeling
and Revelle, 1985; Thompson  et al., 1986; Siegenthaler, 1990;
Elliott  et  al., 1991;  Braswell  et  al., 1997;  Feely  et  al., 1997;
Dettinger and Ghil, 1998; Rayner et al., 1999b). During most of
the  observational  record, El  Niño  events  have  been  marked  by
high  rates  of  increase  in  atmospheric  CO2 concentration
compared  with  surrounding  years, in  the  order  of >  1  PgC/yr
higher during most El Niño events (Figure 3.3). Direct measure-
ments of oceanic CO2 in the equatorial Pacific over the last 20
years have shown that the natural efflux of CO2 from this region
is reduced by between 0.2 to 1.0 PgC/yr during El Niño (Keeling
and Revelle, 1985; Smethie et al., 1985; Takahashi et al., 1986;
Inoue and Sugimura, 1992; Wong et al., 1993; Feely et al., 1997;

1999b), mainly due to the reduced upwelling of CO2-rich waters
(Archer et al., 1996). The ocean response to El Niño in the most
active region thus tends to increase global CO2 uptake, counter to
the increasing atmospheric concentration. Although it cannot be
ruled out that other ocean basins may play a significant role for
global  interannual  variability  in  ocean-atmosphere  flux, the
existing  oceanic  measurements  suggest  (by  default)  that  the
response of the terrestrial biosphere is the cause of the typically
high rates of CO2 increase during El Niño. 

Associated  variations  in  the  north-south  gradient  of CO2
indicate that the El Niño CO2 anomalies originate in the tropics
(Conway  et  al., 1994;  Keeling  and  Piper, 2000).  Typical  El
Niño events are characterised by changed atmospheric circula-

tion  and  precipitation  patterns  (Zeng, 1999)  that  give  rise  to
high  tropical  land  temperatures  (which  would  be  expected  to
increase  Rh  and  reduce  NPP);  concurrent  droughts  which
reduce NPP, especially in the most productive regions such as
the  Amazon  rain  forest;  and  increased  incidence  of  fires  in
tropical regions. Increased cloudiness associated with enhanced
south-east Asian monsoons during the late phase of El Niño has
also been suggested as a factor reducing global NPP (Yang and
Wang, 2000).  Typically, although  not  invariably, the  rate  of
atmospheric  CO2 increase  declines  around  the  start  of  an  El
Niño, then  rapidly  rises  during  the  late  stages  (Elliott  et  al.,
1991;  Conway  et  al., 1994). It  has  been  suggested  that  this
pattern represents early onset of enhanced ocean CO2 uptake,

210

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

followed  by  reduced  terrestrial  CO2 uptake  or  terrestrial  CO2
release (Feely et al., 1987, 1999b; Rayner et al., 1999b; Yang
and Wang, 2000).

Atmospheric δ13C and, more recently, O2 measurements have
been  used  to  partition  the  interannual  variability  of  the
atmospheric  CO2 increase  into  oceanic  and  terrestrial
components. Analyses based on δ13C by Keeling et al. (1995) and
Francey et al. (1995) reached contradictory conclusions, but the
discrepancies are now thought to be due at least in part to δ13C
measurement calibration problems during the 1980s, which have
largely been resolved during the 1990s (Francey et al., 1999a).
For  the  1990s, a  range  of  analyses  using  different  atmospheric
observations  and/or  data  analysis  techniques  estimate  that  the
amplitude of annual peak to peak variation associated with the
ocean is about 2 to 3 PgC/yr and the amplitude associated with
the  terrestrial  biosphere  is  about  4  to  5  PgC/yr  (Rayner  et  al.,
1999a; Joos et al., 1999a; Battle et al., 2000 (O2-based analysis);
Keeling and Piper, 2000; Manning, 2001). A similar partitioning
was  estimated  by  Bousquet  et  al.  (2000)  based  on  the  spatial
pattern of CO2 measurements using the approach described in the
next  section  (3.5.3). However, the  various  reconstructed  time
sequences of terrestrial and ocean uptake differ in many details
and  do  not  provide  conclusive  evidence  of  the  mechanisms
involved.

The  early  1990s  were  unusual  in  that  the  growth  rate  in
atmospheric CO2 was low (1.9 PgC/yr in 1992), especially in the
Northern Hemisphere (Conway et al., 1994), while an extended
El  Niño  event  occurred  in  the  equatorial  Pacific.  Various
mechanisms  have  been  suggested, but  none fully  explain  this
unusual behavior of the carbon cycle. The slow down in the CO2
increase  has  been  linked  to  the  predominantly  mid-  to  high
latitude cooling caused by the Pinatubo eruption (Conway et al.,
1994; Ciais et al., 1995a,b; Schimel et al., 1996), but there is no
proof  of  any  connection  between  these  events.  Other  partial
explanations could come from a temporary slow down of tropical
deforestation  (Houghton  et  al., 2000), or  natural  decadal
variability  in  the  ocean-atmosphere  or  land-atmosphere  fluxes
(Keeling et al., 1995). In any case, the slowdown proved to be
temporary, and the El Niño of 1998 was marked by the highest
rate of CO2 increase on record, 6.0 PgC/yr.

3.5.3 Inverse Modelling of Carbon Sources and Sinks

Inverse modelling attempts to resolve regional patterns of CO2
uptake and release from observed spatial and temporal patterns
in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, sometimes also taking into
consideration  O2 and/or δ13C  measurements. The  most  robust
results are for the latitudinal partitioning of sources and sinks
between northern and southern mid- to high latitudes and the
tropics.  The  observed  annual  mean  latitudinal  gradient  of
atmospheric  CO2 concentration  during  the  last  20  years  is
relatively  large  (about  3  to  4  ppm)  compared  with  current
measurement accuracy. It is however not as large as would be
predicted  from  the  geographical  distribution  of  fossil  fuel
burning – a fact that suggests the existence of a northern sink
for  CO2, as  already  recognised  a  decade  ago  (Keeling  et  al.,
1989; Tans et al., 1990; Enting and Mansbridge, 1991).

Figure 3.5: Inverse model estimates of fossil fuel CO2 uptake by
latitude bands according to eight models using different techniques and
sets of atmospheric observations (results summarised by Heimann,
2001). Positive numbers denote fluxes to the atmosphere; negative
numbers denote uptake from the atmosphere. The ocean-atmosphere
fluxes represent mainly the natural carbon cycle; the land-atmosphere
fluxes may be considered as estimates of the uptake of anthropogenic
CO2 by the land (with some caveats as discussed in the text). The sum
of land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere fluxes is shown because it
is somewhat better constrained by observations than the separate
fluxes, especially for the 1980s when the measurement network was
less extensive than it is today. The 1990s are represented by the period
1990 to 1996 only, because when this exercise was carried out the
modelling groups did not have access to all of the necessary data for
more recent years.

The nature of this sink, however, cannot be determined from
atmospheric  CO2 concentration  measurements  alone.  It  might
reflect, at least in part, a natural source-sink pattern of oceanic
CO2 fluxes  (Keeling  et  al., 1989;  Broecker  and  Peng, 1992).
This view is supported by the early atmospheric CO2 data from
the 1960s (Bolin and Keeling, 1963) which do not show a clear
latitudinal gradient, despite the fact that at that time the fossil

estimated flux due to land-use change
inferred (residual) terrestrial sink

Figure 3.6: Partitioning the 1980s land-atmosphere flux for the tropics
and the northern extratropics. The residual terrestrial sink in different
latitude bands can be inferred by subtracting the land-use change flux
for the 1980s (estimated by modelling studies: Houghton, 1999;
Houghton and Hackler, 1999; Houghton et al., 2000; McGuire et al.,
2001) from the net land-atmosphere flux as obtained from atmospheric
observations by inverse modelling for the same period (Heimann, 2001;
results from Figure 3.5). Positive numbers denote fluxes to the
atmosphere; negative numbers denote uptake from the atmosphere. This
calculation is analogous to the global budget calculation in Table 3.1,
but now the model results are broken down geographically and the
land-atmosphere fluxes are obtained by inverse modelling. The upper
and lower bounds on the residual sink are obtained by pairing opposite
extremes of the ranges of values accepted for the two terms in this
calculation (for example, by subtracting the bottom of the range of
values for land-use change with the top of the range for the land-
atmosphere flux). The mid-ranges are obtained by combining similar
extremes (for example, subtracting the bottom of the range for land-use
change emissions from the bottom of the range land-atmosphere flux).

emissions  were  already  at  least  half  as  large  as  in  the  1990s.
Quantitative analysis shows that the Northern Hemisphere sink
has not changed much in magnitude since the 1960s (Keeling et
al., 1989; Fan et al., 1999). On the other hand, the existing air-
sea  flux  measurements  do  not  support  the  idea  of  a  large
oceanic uptake of CO2 in the Northern Hemisphere (Tans et al.,
1990; Takahashi, 1999). An alternative view, therefore, locates
a significant fraction of this Northern Hemisphere sink on land.
This view is corroborated, at least for the 1990s, by analyses of
the  concurrent  latitudinal  gradients  of  δ13C  (Ciais  et  al.,
1995a,b) and O2 (Keeling et al., 1996b).

Results of analyses for the 1980s and 1990 to 1996, carried
out  by  eight  modelling  groups  using  different  atmospheric
transport models, observational data, constraints and mathemat-
ical procedures, are summarised in Figure 3.5. Only the most
robust findings, i.e., estimates of the mean carbon balance for
three  latitude  bands  averaged  over  the  two  time  periods, are

shown. The latitude bands are: “southern extratropics” (>30°S),
“tropics” (30°S to 30°N) and “northern extratropics” (>30°N).
The  carbon  balance  estimates  are  broken  down  into  land  and
ocean  compartments  within  each  latitude  band  (Heimann,
2001). 

Although the ranges of the estimates in Figure 3.5 limit the
precision  of  any  inference  from  these  analyses, some  clear
features emerge. The inferred ocean uptake pattern shows the
sum of two components: the natural carbon cycle in which CO2
is outgassed in the tropics and taken up in the extratropics, and
the  perturbation  uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2. Separation  of
these  two  components  cannot  be  achieved  from  atmospheric
measurements alone.

The  estimates  for  the  land, on  the  other  hand, in  principle
indicate  the  locations  of  terrestrial  anthropogenic  CO2 uptake
(albeit with caveats listed below). For 1980 to 1989, the inverse-
model  estimates  of  the  land-atmosphere  flux  are  −2.3  to  −0.6
PgC/yr in the northern extratropics and −1.0 to +1.5 PgC/yr in the
tropics. These estimates imply that anthropogenic CO2 was taken
up both in the northern extratropics and in the tropics (balancing
deforestation), as  illustrated  in  Figure  3.6. The  estimated  land-
atmosphere flux in the southern extratropics is estimated as close
to  zero, which  is  expected  given  the  small  land  area  involved.
Estimates  of  CO2 fluxes  for  the  period  1990  to  1996  show  a
general resemblance to those for the 1980s. For 1990 to 1996, the
inverse-model estimates of the land-atmosphere flux are −1.8 to
−0.7 PgC/yr in the northern extratropics and −1.3 to +1.1 PgC/yr
in the tropics. These results suggest a tendency towards a reduced
land-atmosphere flux in the tropics, compared to the 1980s. Such
a  trend  could  be  produced  by  reduced  deforestation, increased
CO2 uptake or a combination of these. 

Inverse  modelling  studies  usually  attempt  greater  spatial
resolution of sources and sinks than is presented in this section.
However, there are large unresolved differences in longitudinal
patterns obtained by inverse modelling, especially in the northern
hemisphere  and  in  the  tropics  (Enting  et  al., 1995, Law  et  al.,
1996;  Fan  et  al., 1998;  Rayner  et  al., 1999a;  Bousquet  et  al.,
1999; Kaminski et al., 1999). These differences may be traced to
different approaches and several difficulties in inverse modelling
of atmospheric CO2 (Heimann and Kaminski, 1999):

• The longitudinal variations in CO2 concentration reflecting net
surface sources and sinks are on annual average typically <1
ppm. Resolution of such a small signal (against a background
of  seasonal  variations  up  to  15  ppm  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere) requires high quality atmospheric measurements,
measurement protocols and calibration procedures within and
between monitoring networks (Keeling et al., 1989; Conway et
al., 1994).

•  Inverse  modelling  results  depend  on  the  properties  of  the
atmospheric transport models used. The north-south transport
of the models can be checked by comparing simulations of the
relatively  well-known  inert  anthropogenic  tracer  SF6 with
measured atmospheric concentrations of this tracer, as recently
investigated  in  the  TRANSCOM  intercomparison  project
(Denning  et  al., 1999).  Unfortunately  there  is  no  currently

212

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

measured  tracer  that  can  be  used  to  evaluate  the  models’
representation  of  longitudinal  transport.  Furthermore, the
strong  seasonality  of  the  terrestrial  CO2 flux  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere  together  with  covarying  seasonal  variations  in
atmospheric  transport  may  induce  significant  mean  annual
gradients  in  concentration  which  do  not  reflect  net  annual
sources and sinks, but which nevertheless have to be modelled
correctly if inverse model calculations are to be reliable (Bolin
and Keeling, 1963; Heimann et al., 1986; Keeling et al., 1989;
Denning et al., 1995; Law et al., 1996). Even the sign of this
so-called “rectifier effect” is uncertain. Some scientists believe
that it may be responsible for a part of the apparent Northern
Hemisphere  uptake  of  CO2 implied  by  inverse  modelling
results (Taylor, 1989; Taylor and Orr, 2000). 

• The spatial partitioning of CO2 uptake could also be distorted by
a few tenths of 1 PgC/yr because the atmospheric concentration
gradients also reflect the natural fluxes induced by weathering,
transport  of  carbon  by  rivers  and  subsequent  outgassing  from
the  ocean  (see  Figure  3.1)  (Sarmiento  and  Sundquist, 1992;
Aumont et al., 2001b). Furthermore, the effects of atmospheric
transport  of  carbon  released  as  CO  and  CH4 (especially  from
incomplete  fossil  fuel  burning, tropical  biomass  burning, and
CH4 from tropical wetlands) with subsequent oxidation to CO2
is generally neglected. Their inclusion in the inversion leads to
corrections  of  the  latitudinal  partitioning  of  up  to  0.1  PgC/yr
(Enting and Mansbridge, 1991).

•  The  distribution  of  atmospheric  CO2 measurement  stations
(Figure  3.7)  is  uneven, and  severely  underrepresents  the
continents.  This  underrepresentation  is  due  in  part  to  the
problem of finding continental locations where measurements
will not be overwhelmed by local sources and sinks. 

•  Because  of  the  finite  number  of  monitoring  stations, the
mathematical inversion problem is highly underdetermined. In
principle a multitude of different surface source/sink configura-
tions  are  compatible  with  the  atmospheric  data, within  their
measurement  accuracy.  Therefore, in  order  to  extract  a
meaningful solution, additional information on the sources and
sinks has to be introduced into the calculation. Examples of this
additional  information  include  maps  of  air-sea  fluxes  from
observations  or  ocean  models, patterns  of  terrestrial  CO2
exchanges  inferred  by  terrestrial  models, and  remote  sensing
data.  Thus, many  methodological  choices  about  the  use  of
auxiliary data can influence the outcome of the analysis.

Interannual variability of climate is likely to strongly influence
the spatial distribution of CO2 sources and sinks, so that analyses
based on a few years of data are insufficient to establish a long-
term trend.

In  conclusion, the  present  atmospheric  measurement
network, current  information  on  air-sea  fluxes  and  current
understanding of vertical atmospheric transport are not sufficient
to allow full use of the potential of inverse modelling techniques
to  infer  geographically  detailed  source-sink  distributions  of
anthropogenic CO2.

3.5.4 Terrestrial Biomass Inventories

Inventory  studies  measure  changes  in  carbon  stocks  over  large
areas, and  can  thus  provide  spatially  aggregated  estimates  of
large-scale  fluxes  of  CO2 over  multi-annual  time-scales  (Box
3.1).  Mid-  and  high  latitude  forests  are  covered  by  extensive
national  inventories  based  on  repeated  measurements  of  many
thousands of plots. Inventories in the tropics are by comparison
generally  inadequate, particularly  in  view  of  the  high  rates  of
land-use change and extremely heterogeneous carbon density in
many  tropical  ecosystems.  There  are  still  therefore  large
uncertainties  in  attempting  to  balance  the  terrestrial  carbon
budget on a global scale using inventory data. 

The FAO Temperate and Boreal Forest Resource Assessment
(TBFRA-2000) is a recent synthesis of inventories of forests and
other wooded lands in Annex I (developed) countries for the early
1990s (UN-ECE/FAO, 2000). Many countries reported substan-
tial increases in forest areas in recent years, as well as increasing
carbon  density  in  existing  forests. According  to  TBFRA-2000,
the  land-atmosphere  flux  was  −0.9  PgC/yr  for  all  Annex  I
countries combined (the net annual increment of trees accounted
for −1.5 PgC/yr, while losses due to fellings were 0.6 PgC/yr). Of
this  flux, −0.8  PgC/yr  was  due  to  uptake  in  “northern” forests
(Europe, CIS, Japan  and  North America). An  earlier  review  of
individual regional and national studies by Dixon et al. (1994),
highlighted in the IPCC WGII Second Assessment Report (IPCC,
1996b; Brown et al., 1996), gave a range of −0.6 to −0.9 PgC/yr
for the land atmosphere flux in northern forests. While TBFRA-
2000 estimated biomass of woody vegetation only, the analyses
reviewed in Dixon et al. (1994) included other vegetation, soils,
litter and wood products. Under the United Nations Framework
Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) signatory countries
are required to report greenhouse gas emissions, including those
from  land-use  change  and  forestry.  Compilation  of  these  data
implies  a  land-atmosphere  flux  of −0.6  PgC/yr  for  all Annex  I
countries, and −0.6 PgC/yr for Annex I countries in the northern
latitudes only (UNFCCC, 2000). While the TBFRA synthesised

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

country  statistics  and  adjusted  data  to  fit  FAO  definitions  and
methodologies  for  calculating  carbon  stocks, the  UNFCCC
report  summarises  emissions  data  reported  by  each  country
according  to  IPCC  guidelines;  interpretation  of  guidelines  is
variable, and not all countries had reported data on land use. The
implications  of  definitions  and  methodologies  in  calculating
carbon  fluxes, particularly  in  relation  to  implementation  of  the
Kyoto Protocol, is discussed in detail in the SRLULUCF (IPCC,
2000a).

A  recent  compilation  of  data  from  478  permanent  plots  in
mature tropical moist forests throughout the tropics over at least
two decades found these were taking up carbon due to increasing
rates  of  tree  growth.  Extrapolation  from  these  plots  led  to  an
estimated  land-atmosphere  flux  of  (0.6  ± 0.3  PgC/yr  in  Latin
America;  growth  trends  in African  and Asian  forests  were  not
significantly different from zero (Phillips et al., 1998). This net
uptake is offset by emissions due to deforestation. Dixon et al.
(1994)  estimated  tropical  forests  overall  to  be  a  net  source  of
carbon with a land-atmosphere flux 1.7 ± 0.4, based mostly on
FAO (1993b) inventory data and simple models of the effect of
land-use  change  (Houghton, 1995).  It  will  not  be  possible  to
assess  trends  and  fluxes  for  the  1990s  in  the  tropics  from
inventory  data  until  a  full  data  set  is  available  from  the  FAO
Global  Forest  Resources  Assessment  2000.  Among  those
countries  that  have  reported  land-use  emissions  data  to  the
UNFCCC, there  are  significant  discrepancies  between  the
primary data used in emissions inventories and the data available
in international surveys; for example, rates of deforestation differ
from rates reported by FAO (1993b) by as much as a factor of six
(Houghton and Ramakrishna, 1999).

The results of globally aggregated forest inventories show a
greater  uptake  of  carbon  in  forest  growth  than  model-based
calculations  of  the  marginal  effects  of  land-use  change  (e.g.,
Houghton, 2000). Thus, inventory studies provide independent
evidence for the existence of a residual terrestrial sink; and they
show that a substantial part of this sink, at least, is located in
northern extratropical and tropical forests. Additional evidence
from individual inventory studies in mature forests that have not
undergone land-use changes shows that carbon stocks in such
forests are increasing (e.g., Lugo and Brown, 1993; Phillips et
al., 1998;  Schulze  et  al., 1999).  The  difference  between  the
northern  extra-tropical  land-atmosphere  flux  of  around  −0.8
PgC/yr calculated by inventories (TBFRA-2000) and that of −
0.1 PgC/yr from land-use statistics (Houghton, 2000), both for
the early 1990s, implies a residual terrestrial sink on the order
of −0.7 PgC/yr in northern mid- and high latitudes. Combining
this with the estimated sink of −0.6 PgC/yr in mature tropical
moist  forests  (Phillips  et  al., 1998)  makes  it  plausible  that  at
least a significant fraction of the current global terrestrial sink
(Table 3.1) could be explained by an increase of carbon stocks
in  extant  forests.  The  inventory-based  estimate  of  land-
atmosphere  flux  in  northern  forests  (−0.8  PgC/yr)  is  at  the
positive end of the range calculated by inverse modelling studies
for  the  >30°N  latitude  band  from  1990  to  1996  (−1.8  to −0.7
PgC/yr, Section  3.5.3), either  because  of  biases  in  inverse
modelling  that  might  tend  to  increase  apparent  uptake  in  the
north (Section 3.5.3), or because possible sinks in other ecosys-

tems (e.g., temperate grassland soils) have not been considered
in  the  inventories.  In  the  tropics, the  difference  between  the
uptake  of  carbon  estimated  by  inventory  studies  in  mature
forests  of  Latin America (−0.6  PgC/yr)  (Phillips  et  al., 1998)
and the estimated emissions due to deforestation in the tropics
of  1.7  PgC/yr  (Houghton, 2000)  yields  an  estimated  land-
atmosphere flux of 1.1 PgC/yr, which is at the positive end of
the  range  calculated  by  inverse  modelling  studies  for  30°S  to
30°N (−1.3 to +1.1 PgC/yr, Section 3.5.3). Again, it should be
noted  that  possible  additional  sinks  (e.g., in  savannas)  are
neglected by the land-use and inventory-based calculations.

3.6 Carbon Cycle Model Evaluation

3.6.1  Terrestrial and Ocean Biogeochemistry Models

The interactions of complex processes as discussed in Section 3.2
can be analysed with models that incorporate current knowledge
at the process level, including syntheses of experimental results.
Process-based models make it possible to explore the potential
consequences of climate variability for the global carbon cycle,
and to project possible future changes in carbon cycling associ-
ated with changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation. Models
can be run with prescribed inputs such as observations of surface
climate and CO2 or the output of climate models. They can also
be coupled to atmospheric general circulation models (Cox et al.,
2000; Friedlingstein et al., 2000), to allow simulation of a wider
range of interactions between climate and the carbon cycle. 

Process-based terrestrial models used in carbon cycle studies
are  (a)  terrestrial  biogeochemical  models  (TBMs), which
simulate  fluxes  of  carbon, water  and  nitrogen  coupled  within
terrestrial ecosystems, and (b) dynamic global vegetation models
(DGVMs), which  further  couple  these  processes  interactively
with changes in ecosystem structure and composition (competi-
tion among different plant functional types; Prentice et al., 2000).
The  treatment  of  carbon-nutrient  interaction  varies  widely;  for
example, some  models  treat  nitrogen  supply  explicitly  as  a
constraint on NPP, while others do not. There are currently about
30  TBMs  and  <10  DGVMs.  Cramer  and  Field  (1999)  and
Cramer et al. (2001) reported results from intercomparisons of
TBMs and DGVMs respectively. A current international project,
Ecosystem  Model/Data  Intercomparison  (EMDI), aims  to  test
models of both types against a large set of terrestrial measure-
ments, in  order  to  better  constrain  the  modelled  responses  of
terrestrial carbon cycling to changes in CO2 and climate. 

Process-based  ocean  models  used  in  carbon  cycle  studies
include  surface  exchange  of  CO2 with  the  atmosphere, carbon
chemistry, transport  by  physical  processes  in  the  ocean, and
transport  by  marine  biology.  The  parametrization  of  marine
biology can be classified as (a) nutrient-based models where the
export of carbon below the surface ocean (approximately the top
50 m) is a function of surface nutrient concentration, (b) nutrient-
restoring models in which biological carbon fluxes are set to the
rates  required  for  maintaining  observed  nutrient  concentration
gradients  against  dissipation  by  ocean  mixing, and  (c)  models
that  explicitly  represent  the  food  chain  involving  nutrients,
phytoplankton, zooplankton  and  detritus  (NPZD  models).  In

214

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

current  models, the  uptake  of  anthropogenic  CO2 is  controlled
mainly  by  physical  transport  and  surface  carbon  chemistry,
whereas  the  natural  carbon  cycle  is  controlled  by  physical,
chemical  and  biological  processes.  The  Ocean  Carbon  Cycle
Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP) compared the perform-
ance  of  four  ocean  models  with  respect  to  natural  and  anthro-
pogenic tracers (Sarmiento et al., 2000; Orr et al., 2001), and is
currently undergoing a similar comparison with 13 models and
an extended data set (Orr and Dutay, 1999).

3.6.2 Evaluation of Terrestrial Models

Evaluation  of  terrestrial  carbon  cycle  models  requires  different
types of data to test processes operating on a range of time-scales
from hours to centuries (see Section 3.2.2), including short-term
environmental  responses  of  CO2 and  water  fluxes  between
vegetation  canopies  and  the  atmosphere  (e.g., Cienciala  et  al.,
1998), responses  of  ecosystem  carbon  balance  to  interannual
climate variability (e.g. Kindermann et al., 1996; Heimann et al.,
1997; Gérard et al., 1999; Knorr, 2000; Prentice et al., 2000), and
longer-term  consequences  of  historical  land-use  change
(McGuire  et  al., 2001). Differences and uncertainties in model
behaviour  have  been  evaluated  through  model  intercomparison
(Cramer et al., 1999, 2001) and sensitivity analyses (Knorr, 2000;
Knorr and Heimann, 2001a).

3.6.2.1 Natural carbon cycling on land
Terrestrial model evaluation has traditionally been carried out as
comparisons  with  in  situ field  observations  of  ecosystem
variables (e.g., Raich et al., 1991; Foley, 1994; Haxeltine and
Prentice, 1996). The largest data sets of relevant field measure-
ments  are  for  NPP  and  soil  carbon  content.  Other  “target”
variables  include  soil  moisture, nitrogen  mineralisation  rate,
and the amounts of carbon and nitrogen in different compart-
ments  of  the  ecosystem.  Such  comparisons  have  generally
shown  reasonable  agreement  between  observed  and  modelled
geographic patterns of these variables, but they do not test the
time-dependent  response  of  models  to  environmental
variability.

Time-dependent data sets for in situ comparisons are now
becoming available, thanks to eddy-covariance measurements
of CO2 fluxes (Section 3.2.2.1; Box 3.1). Daily and seasonal
cycles of CO2 and water fluxes provide a test of the coupling
between  the  carbon  and  hydrological  cycles  as  simulated  by
terrestrial models (Cienciala et al., 1998). Flux measurements
are  now  being  carried  out  on  a  multi-annual  basis  at  an
increasing  number  of  stations, although  global  coverage
remains uneven, with the greatest concentration in Europe and
North America  and  few  measurements  from  the  tropics  (see
Box  3.1).  Field  campaigns  have  started  to  retrieve  flux  data
from  more  remote  regions  (e.g., Schulze  et  al., 1999).  The
Large-scale  Biosphere Atmosphere  Experiment  in Amazonia,
LBA, will yield more comprehensive data on the carbon, water
and  energy  exchanges  of  tropical  terrestrial  ecosystems  and
will  allow  a  more  rigorous  evaluation  of  the  performance  of
models in the tropics than has been possible up until now (e.g.,
Tian  et  al., 1998). As  current  models  show  conflicting

responses  of  global  NPP  to  climate  (Cramer  et  al., 1999),
systematic  comparisons  with  seasonal  and  interannual  flux
measurements are a priority to reduce uncertainties in terres-
trial carbon modelling.

Terrestrial  models  have  also  been  evaluated  at  a  global
scale  by  comparing  simulated  ecosystem  water  balance  with
river runoff (e.g., Neilson and Marks, 1994; Foley et al., 1996;
Kucharik et al., 2000), and simulated seasonal leaf area with
satellite  observations  of  “greenness”, often  based  on  the
normalised  difference  vegetation  index  (NDVI)  (Field  et  al.,
1995b; de Fries et al., 1995). NDVI data can be translated into
estimates  of  the  plant-absorbed  fraction  of  incoming  photo-
synthetically  active  radiation  (FPAR)  (Asrar  et  al, 1992),
which is related to leaf area index (LAI). The first terrestrial
model  intercomparison  showed  differences  among  model
simulations of LAI and its seasonality (Bondeau et al., 1999).
More recently, it has been shown that constraining a terrestrial
model with remotely sensed spatial patterns of FPAR can lead
to a reduction of uncertainty in NPP simulations by about one
third (Knorr and Heimann, 2001b). Agreement with patterns of
remotely sensed FPAR has thus become a standard benchmark
for terrestrial models (Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996; Kucharik
et al., 2000) and attention has been focused on improving the
simulation of LAI and its seasonal variations. 

A  more  direct  test  of  the  simulated  net  exchange  of  CO2
between  the  terrestrial  biosphere  and  the  atmosphere  is
provided by comparison with atmospheric CO2 measurements
at remote monitoring sites. The comparison requires the use of
an atmospheric transport model to simulate CO2 as a passive
tracer  (Kaminski  et  al., 1996).  The  seasonal  cycle  of
atmospheric  CO2 shows  a  strong  latitudinal  pattern  in
amplitude  and  phase, and is  dominated  by  the  terrestrial
biosphere (Heimann et al., 1998). The ability to simulate this
seasonal  cycle  thus  constitutes  a  benchmark  for  terrestrial
models’ response to climate (Denning et al., 1996; Hunt et al.,
1996;  Heimann  et  al., 1998;  Nemry  et  al., 1999). Generally,
the observed seasonal cycles of CO2 in northern and tropical
latitudes can be well simulated, with terrestrial models using
NDVI  data  as  input  (Knorr  and  Heimann, 1995), or  by  fully
prognostic models, including DGVMs (Prentice et al., 2000). 
Major  features  of  interannual  variability  of  the  CO2
increase are also simulated by terrestrial models (Kindermann
et al., 1996; Heimann et al., 1997; Gérard et al., 1999; Ito and
Oikawa, 2000; Knorr, 2000; Prentice et al., 2000). This finding
supports  the  hypothesis  (Section  3.5.2)  that  terrestrial  effects
are important in determining the interannual variability of CO2
uptake. During typical El Niño events, terrestrial model results
consistently show strongly reduced CO2 uptake or CO2 release
by  the  land.  This  result  has  been  obtained  with  a  range  of
models, even  when  the  models  differ  substantially  in  the
relative sensitivitivities of NPP and heterotrophic respiration to
temperature (Heimann et al., 1997; Knorr, 2000). The low CO2
growth rate during the early 1990s has been simulated by some
terrestrial models (Prentice et al., 2000; Knorr, 2000).

At  the  longest  time-scales  of  interest, spanning  the
industrial period, models of the natural terrestrial carbon cycle
show a pronounced response to rising atmospheric CO2 levels

Figure 3.8: Modelled fluxes of anthropogenic CO2 over the past
century. (a) Ocean model results from OCMIP (Orr and Dutay, 1999;
Orr et al., 2000); (b), (c) terrestrial model results from CCMLP
(McGuire et al., 2001). Positive numbers denote fluxes to the
atmosphere; negative numbers denote uptake from the atmosphere.
The ocean model results appear smooth because they contain no
interannual variability, being forced only by historical changes in
atmospheric CO2. The results are truncated at 1990 because
subsequent years were simulated using a CO2 concentration scenario
rather than actual measurements, leading to a likely overestimate of
uptake for the 1990s. The terrestrial model results include effects of
historical CO2 concentrations, climate variations, and land-use
changes based on Ramankutty and Foley (2000). The results were
smoothed using a 10-year running mean to remove short-term
variability. For comparison, grey boxes denote observational
estimates of CO2 uptake by the ocean in panel (a) and by the land in
panel (b) (from Table 3.1). Land-use change flux estimates from
Houghton et al. (1999) are shown by the black line in panel (c). The
grey boxes in panel (c) indicate the range of decadal average values
for the land-use change flux accepted by the SRLULUCF (Bolin et
al., 2000) for the 1980s and for 1990 to 1995.

as a result of CO2 fertilisation, generally larger than the NPP
response to the climate change over this period (Kicklighter et
al., 1999).  According  to  CCMLP  results, the  CO2 increase
maintains  a  lead  of  NPP  over  Rh  and  an  increase  of  the
amplitude  of  the  seasonal  CO2 cycle  (McGuire  et  al., 2001),
consistent with long-term observations (Keeling et al., 1996a),
which  indicate  an  increase  in  amplitude  of  about  20%  since
accurate  atmospheric  measurements  began. However, the
magnitude of this effect was greatly over- or under estimated by
some models, reflecting unresolved differences in the parame-
trization of the CO2 fertilisation response.

3.6.2.2 Uptake and release of anthropogenic CO2 by the land
The most comprehensive model-based estimates of the terrestrial
components of the anthropogenic CO2 budget are those that have
been produced by the CCMLP. McGuire et al. (2001) used two
TBMs and two DGVMs driven by changes in atmospheric CO2,
then  changes  in  CO2 with  historical  changes  in  climate  (from
observations), and finally changes in CO2 and climate with land-
use change from Ramankutty and Foley (2000) (Figure 3.8; Table
3.4). In these simulations, CO2 fertilisation accounted for a land-
atmosphere  flux  of  −0.9  to  −3.1  PgC/yr, land-use  change  a
positive flux of 0.6 to 1.0 PgC/yr, and climate variability a small
additional effect of uncertain sign, −0.2 to 0.9 PgC/yr during the
1980s. The  total  land-atmosphere  flux  simulated  for  the  1980s
amounted  to  −0.3  to  −1.5  PgC/yr, which  is  consistent  with  or
slightly more negative than the observationally-based estimate of
−0.2 ± 0.7 PgC/yr (Table 3.1). Net uptake by all models reported
in  McGuire  et  al. (2001)  is  shown  to  be  occurring  mainly  in
tropical, temperate  and  boreal  forests  − consistent  with  forest
inventory  data  (Section  3.5.4)  –  while  some  regions  (notably
semi-arid tropical and sub-tropical regions) show net carbon loss.
The model estimates of the CO2 source due to land-use change
are substantially smaller than the estimate of Houghton (1999)
(Section 3.4.2). This divergence primarily reflects disagreements
between the Houghton (1999) and Ramankutty and Foley (2000)
data  sets  as  to  the  timing  of  tropical  deforestation  in  different
regions (see Section 3.4.2).

There is no general agreement on how to model the linkage
between  reactive  nitrogen  deposition  and  vegetation  produc-
tivity, and  recent  model  estimates  of  the  additional  effect  of
anthropogenic nitrogen fertilisation on the global carbon cycle
vary widely. The anthropogenic nitrogen input itself (Holland et
al., 1999), the fate of anthropogenic nitrogen in the ecosystem
(Nadelhoffer et al., 1999; Jenkinson et al., 1999), and changes
in  ecosystem  nitrogen  fixation  (Vitousek  and  Field, 1999)
represent major sources of uncertainty. Estimates of the anthro-
pogenic nitrogen effect range from −0.2 PgC/yr (Nadelhoffer et
al., 1999)  to −1.1  or −1.4  PgC/yr  (Holland  et  al., 1997). The
model with the smallest CO2 fertilisation effect (−0.9 PgC/yr)
in the McGuire et al. (2001) study has been shown to respond
strongly to anthropogenic nitrogen input, yielding a combined
(CO2 and  nitrogen)  fertilisation  effect  of  −1.5  PgC/yr.  A
modelling  study  by  Lloyd  (1999)  suggests  that  CO2 and
nitrogen fertilisation effects may by synergistic. Evaluation of
model results on carbon-nitrogen coupling against experimental
results is a current research focus.

3.6.3  Evaluation of Ocean Models

Natural  and  anthropogenic  tracers  have  been  extensively
measured, most recently as part of the Joint Global Ocean Flux
Study  (JGOFS)  and  World  Ocean  Circulation  Experiment
(WOCE). Because of these measurement campaigns, such tracers
provide  important  opportunities  to  evaluate  representations  of
ocean physics and biogeochemistry in models.

3.6.3.1 Natural carbon cycling in the ocean
Most global ocean models of the carbon cycle are successful in
reproducing  the  main  vertical  and  horizontal  features  of  ocean
carbon content (Maier-Reimer, 1993; Aumont, 1998; Murnane et
al., 1999).  The  observed  features  reasonably  reproduced  by  all
ocean models are the mean vertical gradient in DIC, with enriched
deep  ocean  concentrations  (Goyet  and  Davies, 1997), and the
spatial patterns of surface pCO2 with outgassing in the tropics and
uptake at higher latitudes (Takahashi et al., 1999). Furthermore,
models  which  incorporate  marine  biology  (including  DOC  and
plankton  dynamics)  roughly  reproduce  the  seasonal  cycle  of
surface ocean pCO2, atmospheric O2 after it has been corrected for
seasonal land variability, and surface chlorophyll (Six and Maier-
Reimer, 1996; Stephens et al., 1998; Aumont et al., 2001a). Ocean
carbon  models  can  also  roughly  reproduce  the  phase  and
amplitude  of  interannual  variability  of  ocean  pCO2 in  the
equatorial Pacific (Winguth et al., 1994; Le Quéré et al., 2000)
in  agreement  with  available  observations  (Feely  et  al., 1997;
1999b; Boutin et al., 1999). 

Although  many  first-order  features  can  be  reproduced  by
global  models, there  are  still  important  aspects  of  the  ocean
carbon cycle that are not well simulated, because either marine
biology  or  ocean  physics  are  imperfectly  reproduced.  Ocean
carbon  models  have  difficulties  in  reproducing  the  spatial
structure of the deep ocean 14C (Orr et al., 2001), which suggests
problems in simulating the physical exchange of carbon between
surface  and  the  deep  ocean.  Models  display  their  largest
disagreements where fewest observations exist, in particular in
the important region of the Southern Ocean where the mixing of
tracers  is  subject  to  large  uncertainties  (Caldeira  and  Duffy,
2000; Sarmiento et al., 2000; Orr et al., 2001). In spite of these
differences, all  ocean  carbon  models  estimate  zero  interhemi-
spheric transport of carbon (Sarmiento et al., 2000) whereas a
transport  as  large  as  1  PgC/yr  has  been  inferred  from
atmospheric  CO2 measurements  (Keeling  et  al., 1989).
Consideration of the global transport of carbon by rivers reduces
the  discrepancy  but  does  not  remove  it  (Sarmiento  and
Sundquist, 1992; Aumont et al., 2001b). Atmospheric CO2 and
O2 measurements  suggest  that interhemispheric  transport  may
be  incorrectly  simulated  by  ocean  models  (Stephens  et  al.,
1998), and could hint at difficulties in modelling heat transport
(Murnane et al., 1999). Recent data from the Southern Ocean,
however, seem closer to model results (Stephens, 1999) and the
question  about  interhemispheric  transport  thus  remains  open.
These problems could partly be resolved by a better representa-
tion of the physical transport of carbon in the ocean, especially
isopycnal diffusion, sub-grid eddy mixing, and sea-ice formation
(Stephens et al., 1999).

Three common problems related to marine biology in global
ocean  models  are  discussed  here.  First, most  models  poorly
represent the formation and dissolution of CaCO3, which controls
alkalinity. This  process  is  often  parameterized  as  a  function  of
direct  or  indirect  observations  (salinity, temperature, nutrients).
Although  correct  for  the  present  day  ocean, this  parametrisation
may  not  hold  for  past  or  future  conditions  with  different  ocean
circulation and surface water fluxes. The alkalinity cycle is difficult
to  represent  because  the  rate  of  CaCO3 formation  derived  from
observations is consistently larger than the one required by models
for  reproducing  observed  deep  ocean  alkalinity  (Maier-Reimer,
1993; Yamanaka and Tajika, 1996). Second, marine productivity
tends to be underestimated by models in sub-tropical regions and
overestimated in the equatorial oceans and at high latitudes in the
North Pacific and Southern Oceans. The overestimation may be
caused  by  limitation  in  plankton  growth  by  iron  (Coale  et  al.,
1996; Boyd et al., 2000; Archer and Johnson, 2000), while under-
estimation  in  the  sub-tropics  partly  stems  from  neglecting
mesoscale variability (McGillicuddy and Robinson, 1997; Oschlies
and Garçon, 1998). The remaining discrepancies might be attrib-
uted in part to more complex processes involving nitrogen fixation
(Karl et al., 1997). Finally, the tight coupling between carbon and
either nitrogen or phosphate, which is generally implicit in ocean
carbon models, precludes the simulation of past or future marine
biological feedback mechanisms that involve a partial decoupling
between carbon and nutrients (see Section 3.2.3).

3.6.3.2 Uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean
Ocean  uptake  is  constrained  to  some  degree  by  observations  of
anthropogenic tracers. Three transient tracers are commonly used.
First, anthropogenic CO2 itself gives a direct benchmark for model
estimates of the quantity and distribution of anthropogenic CO2 that
has penetrated the ocean since the pre-industrial era. Anthropogenic
CO2 can  be inventoried  by  an  indirect  method  whereby  carbon
concentration is compared to what would be expected from water
exposed  to  pre-industrial  air  (Gruber  et  al., 1996).  The  14CO2
released  in  the  early  1960s  by  atmospheric  nuclear  testing
(commonly called bomb 14C) provides a second tracer; the content
of bomb 14C in the ocean is used to constrain global air-sea CO2
exchange (Wanninkhof et al., 1992), and ocean model results can
be compared with its penetration depth as a benchmark for vertical
transport  (Broecker  et  al., 1995).  Bomb  14C is  computed  by
subtracting the observed 14C concentration from an estimate of its
pre-industrial  value  (Broecker  et  al., 1995).  Finally, CFCs  also
constrain the downward transport of tracers in ocean models. No
natural  background  needs  to  be  subtracted  from  CFCs.  None  of
these three tracers provide a perfect indicator of anthropogenic CO2
uptake: CO2 equilibrates with the atmosphere ten times faster than
14C and ten times slower than CFCs; anthropogenic CO2 and 14C
are indirectly estimated. As part of the Ocean Carbon-Cycle Model
Intercomparison Project (OCMIP), a comparison of carbon models
with respect to all three anthropogenic tracers is in progress (Orr
and Dutay, 1999; Orr et al., 2001). 

Although  regional  estimates  show  discrepancies, modelled
estimates  of  anthropogenic  tracers  agree  reasonably  well  with
observations  when  integrated  globally.  The  mean  value  of  the
penetration depth of bomb 14C for all observational sites during

Figure 3.9: Anthropogenic CO2 in the Atlantic Ocean (µmol/kg): comparison of data and models. The top left panel shows the sampling transect;
the top right panel shows estimates of anthropogenic CO2 content along this transect using observations from several cruises between 1981 and
1989 (Gruber, 1998).  Anthropogenic CO2 is not measured directly but is separated from the large background of oceanic carbon by an indirect
method based on observations (Gruber et al., 1996). The remaining panels show simulations of anthropogenic CO2 content made with four ocean
carbon models forced by the same atmospheric CO2 concentration history (Orr et al., 2000).

the late 1970s is 390 ± 39 m (Broecker et al., 1995). For the same
years  and  stations, modelled  estimates  range  between  283  and
376 m (Orr et al., 2001). Modelled and observed CFC concen-
trations  have  been  compared  locally  but  not  yet  globally
(England  1995;  Robitaille  and  Weaver, 1995;  Orr  and  Dutay,
1999).  Modelled  anthropogenic  CO2 inventory  since  1800  is

comparable to the estimate of 40 ± 9 PgC for the Atlantic Ocean
(Gruber, 1998) and 20 ± 3 PgC for the Indian Ocean (Sabine et
al., 1999;  Orr  et  al., 2001).  Latitude-depth  profiles  of  anthro-
pogenic  CO2 in  the  Atlantic, extracted  from  data  and  from
models, are shown in Figure 3.9. Modelled CO2 uptake for the
global  ocean  between  1800  and  1990  ranges  between  100  and

218

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

133 PgC (Figure 3.8), comparable to the preliminary data-based
estimate of 107 ± 27 PgC for the global ocean, which includes
the Pacific value of 45 ± 15 PgC (Feely et al., 1999a). Although
in  reasonable  agreement  with  basin  and  global  estimates  of
anthropogenic  CO2, modelled  inventories  exhibit  large  differ-
ences  at  the  regional  scale: models  tend  to  underestimate  the
inventory of anthropogenic CO2 between 50°S and 50°N in the
Atlantic  and  Indian  Oceans, and  to  overestimate  it  at  high
latitudes (Sabine et al., 1999; Orr et al., 2001). In the Southern
Ocean the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 varies by a factor of two
among  models  (Orr  et  al., 2001). The  difficulty  for  models  in
reproducing the spatial structure of anthropogenic tracers may
be  indicative  of  problems  in  ocean  physics  mentioned  earlier,
and  may  be  responsible  for  the  increasing  range  of  model
estimates  when  future  CO2 uptake  is  projected  by  the  same
models (Figure 3.10c).

The most recent model estimates of the ocean-atmosphere flux
obtained with process-based models are −1.5 to −2.2 for 1980 to
1989 (Table 3.4), in agreement with earlier model estimates for the
same period (Enting et al., 1994; Orr et al., 2001). These estimates
are fully consistent with the budget based on atmospheric observa-
tions alone (Table 3.1), with estimates based on pCO2 and δ13C
observations (Table 3.4), and with the SAR estimate of −2.0 ± 0.8
PgC/yr. Figure 3.8 shows modelled ocean CO2 uptake for 1900 to
2000. (These results do not include natural variability and therefore
appear smoother than in reality.) The oceanic regions absorbing the
largest quantities of anthropogenic CO2 according to models are
those  where  older  waters  come  in  contact  with  the  atmosphere,
such  as  high  latitudes  and  upwelling  regions  of  the  equator.  In
contrast, modelled  sub-tropical  regions  rapidly  saturate  at
atmospheric CO2 level and do not absorb large quantities of anthro-
pogenic CO2 (Sarmiento et al., 1992; Orr et al., 2001).

Figure 3.10: Projections of anthropogenic CO2 uptake by process-based models. Six dynamic global vegetation models were run with IS92a CO2
concentrations as given in the SAR: (a) CO2 only, and (b) with these CO2 concentrations plus simulated climate changes obtained from the Hadley
Centre climate model with CO2 and sulphate aerosol forcing from IS92a (Cramer et al., 2000). Panel (b) also shows the envelope of the results from
panel (a) (in grey). (c) Ten process-based ocean carbon models were run with the same CO2 concentrations, assuming a constant climate (Orr and
Dutay, 1999; Orr et al., 2000). A further six models were used to estimate the climate change impact on ocean CO2 uptake as a proportional change
from the CO2-only case. The resulting changes were imposed on the mean trajectory of the simulations shown in panel (c), shown by the black line
in panel (d), yielding the remaining trajectories in panel (d). The range of model results in panel (d) thus represents only the climate change impact
on CO2 uptake; the range does not include the range of representations of ocean physical transport, which is depicted in panel (c).

3.7 Projections of CO2 Concentration and their Implications

3.7.1 Terrestrial Carbon Model Responses to Scenarios of 

Change in CO2 and Climate

Possible  feedbacks  from  terrestrial  carbon  cycling  to
atmospheric  CO2 were  assessed  using  multiple  models  by
Cramer et al. (2001). Six DGVMs (Figure 3.10a) (Foley et al.,
1996; Brovkin et  al., 1997; Friend  et  al., 1997; Woodward et
al., 1998;  Huntingford  et  al., 2000;  Sitch, 2000)  were  driven
first by CO2 concentrations derived from the IS92a emissions
scenario as in the SAR, and then with CO2 changes plus climate
changes derived from the HadCM2 coupled ocean-atmosphere
general circulation model simulation including sulphate aerosol
effects as described by Mitchell  et  al. (1995). Except for one
empirical model (VECODE; Brovkin et al., 1997), the models
included explicit representation of all the following processes:
the  CO2 fertilisation  effect  on  NPP  (modelled  explicitly  in
terms of photosynthesis, respiration, and feedbacks associated
with carbon allocation); responses of NPP to climate specific to
each plant functional type (PFT); competition among PFTs for
light  and  water;  dynamic  shifts  in  vegetation  structure  due  to
climate  and  CO2 effects;  competitive  limits  to  above-ground
biomass; natural disturbance regimes and their interaction with
PFT  composition;  soil  temperature  and  moisture  effects  on
heterotrophic respiration. Two models include an interactive N
cycle.  Land  use  and  anthropogenic  N  deposition  were  not
considered. 

Driven  by  increases  in  CO2 beyond  the  present  day, the
modelled sink due to CO2 fertilisation continued to increase. By
the middle of the 21st century the simulated land-atmosphere
flux due to CO2 was in the range −8.7 to −3.6 PgC/yr. Beyond
mid-century  the  rate  of  increase  became  less, due  to  the
declining  photosynthetic  response  to  CO2.  When  the  climate
change  scenario  was  included  as  well  as  the  CO2 increase,
modelled  uptake  was  reduced  compared  with  the  CO2-only
analysis. At mid-century, climate change reduced the uptake by
21 to 43%. A marked decline in terrestrial uptake after the mid-
century was seen in two models, and one model had zero terres-
trial uptake by 2100. By 2100 the range of model estimates of
the land-atmosphere flux had widened to −6.7 to +0.4 PgC/yr.
Increasing  heterotrophic  respiration  in  response  to  warming
(Cao  and  Woodward, 1998a,b;  Cramer  et  al., 2001)  was  a
common factor (but not the only one) leading to reduced land
uptake. The differences among the modelled climate responses
were largely due to unresolved discrepancies in the response of
global  NPP  to  temperature.  The  balance  of  positive  versus
negative  regional  effects  of  climate  change  on  NPP  was
estimated differently by these models, to the extent that the sign
of the global response of NPP to climate change alone was not
consistent. In addition, one model simulated a partial replace-
ment of the Amazon rainforest by C4 grassland. This response
was  not  shown, or  occurred  on  a  much  smaller  scale, in  the
other models. The details of this modelling exercise are presum-
ably dependent on sensitivity of the particular climate model,
and regional aspects of the simulated climate change (Cramer et
al., 2001).

3.7.2 Ocean Carbon Model Responses to Scenarios of Change 

in CO2 and Climate

Analogous simulations have been performed with several ocean
carbon  models  (Figure  3.10c,d).  To  compute  the  impact  of
increasing CO2 alone (no climate change), OCMIP models were
forced to follow the atmospheric CO2 concentration derived from
the IS92a scenario as in the DGVM experiment (Figure 3.10a,b)
(Orr and Dutay, 1999). All models agreed in projecting that the
annual  ocean-atmosphere  flux  of  CO2 continues  to  become
larger, reaching  −6.7  to  −4.5  PgC/yr  by  2100  (Figure  3.10c).
Since  surface  conditions  (temperature, wind  speed, alkalinity)
were prescribed, the range in model estimates stems only from
different representations of physical transport processes. 

Several  atmosphere-ocean  models  were  used  to  project  the
effect of climate change (Maier-Reimer et al., 1996; Sarmiento et
al., 1998; Matear and Hirst, 1999; Joos et al., 1999b; Bopp et al.,
2001).  These  models  include  most  processes  previously
discussed, including  all  processes  associated  with  carbonate
chemistry and gas exchange, physical and biological transport of
CO2, and changes in temperature, salinity, wind speed, and ice
cover.  They  account  for  simple  changes  in  biological  produc-
tivity, but  not  for  changes  in  external  nutrient  supply, species
composition, pH, or  Redfield  ratios, all  of  which  could  be
involved in more complex biological feedbacks. Coupled models
estimate the impact of climate change as a departure, reported in
per  cent, from  a  “control” experiment  modelling  the  effect  of
increasing atmospheric CO2 alone. 

In climate change simulations, warming of surface waters and
increased  stratification  of  the  upper  ocean  produced  an  overall
positive feedback that reduced the accumulated ocean uptake of
CO2 by  6  to  25%  between  1990  and  the  middle  of  the  21st
century, as compared with the CO2-only case. In the first part of
the simulation, the climate-mediated feedback is mainly due to
the  temperature  effect  on  CO2 solubility  (Sarmiento  and  Le
Quéré, 1996; Matear and Hirst, 1999). Towards the mid-century,
the  impact  of  circulation  changes  becomes  significant  in  most
models, with the net effect of further reducing ocean CO2 uptake.
To investigate the effect of climate change on the IS92a scenario,
the average of the OCMIP CO2-only projections (mean of results
in  Figure  3.10c)  was  used  as  a  baseline  and  the  reduction  in
atmosphere-ocean  CO2 flux  caused  by  climate  change  (in  per
cent  since  the  beginning  of  the  simulation)  was  applied  to  this
curve (Figure 3.10d). The range in model results (Figure 3.10d)
must  be  attributed  to  uncertainties  related  to  climate  change
feedback, and not to uncertainties in the modelling of physical
transport as shown in Figure 3.10c. 

The range of model estimates of the climate change impact is
dependent on the choice of scenario for atmospheric CO2 and on
assumptions concerning marine biology (Joos et al., 1999b). At
high  CO2 concentrations, marine  biology  can  have  a  greater
impact on atmospheric CO2 than at low concentrations because
the  buffering  capacity  of  the  ocean  is  reduced  (see  Box  3.3)
(Sarmiento and Le Quéré, 1996). Although the impact of changes
in  marine  biology  is  highly  uncertain  and  many  key  processes
discussed in Section 3.2.3.1 are not included in current models,
sensitivity  studies  can  provide  approximate  upper  and  lower

220

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

bounds  for  the  potential  impact  of  marine  biology  on  future
ocean CO2 uptake. A sensitivity study of two extreme scenarios
for nutrient supply to marine biology gave a range of 8 to 25%
for the reduction of CO2 uptake by mid-century (Sarmiento et al.,
1998). This range is comparable to other uncertainties, including
those stemming from physical transport (Figure 3.10c).

3.7.3 Coupled Model Responses and Implications for Future 

CO2 Concentrations

Carbon  cycle  models  have  indicated  the  potential  for  climate
change to influence the rate of CO2 uptake by both land (Section
3.7.1) and oceans (Section 3.7.2) and thereby influence the time
course of atmospheric CO2 concentration for any given emissions
scenario.  Coupled models are required to quantify these effects.
Two  general  circulation  model  simulations  have  included
interactive land and ocean carbon cycle components (Cox et al.,
2000; Friedlingstein et al., 2001).  The Cox et al. (2000) model
was driven by CO2 emissions from the IS92a scenario (Legget et
al., 1992) and the Friedlingstein et al. (2001) model was driven by
CO2 emissions from the SRES A2 scenario (IPCC, 2000b).  Both
simulations indicate a positive feedback, i.e., both CO2 concentra-
tions  and  climate  change  at  the  end  of  the  21st  century  are
increased due to the coupling.  The simulated magnitudes of the
effect differ (+70 ppm, Friedlingstein et al., 2001; +270 ppm, Cox
et al., 2000). In the Cox et al. (2000) simulation, which included
a DGVM, the increased atmospheric CO2 is caused mainly by loss
of  soil  carbon  and  in  part  by  tropical  forest  die  back.    The
magnitude  of  the  climate-carbon  cycle  feedback  still  has  large
uncertainties  associated  with  the  response  of  the  terrestrial
biosphere  to  climate  change, especially  the  response  of
heterotrophic respiration and tropical forest NPP to temperature
(Cox et al., 2000; see Sections 3.2.2.3 and 3.7.1).  In the following
section, simplified models are used to assess these uncertainties.

Figure 3.11: Projected CO2 concentrations resulting from the IS92a
emissions scenario. For a strict comparison with previous work, IS92a-
based projections were made with two fast carbon cycle models, Bern-
CC and ISAM (see Box 3.7), based on CO2 changes only, and on CO2
changes plus land and ocean climate feedbacks. Panel (a) shows the
CO2 emisisons prescribed by IS92a; the panels (b) and (c) show
projected CO2 concentrations for the Bern-CC and ISAM models,
respectively. Results obtained for the SAR, using earlier versions of the
same models, are also shown. The model ranges for ISAM were
obtained by tuning the model to approximate the range of responses to
CO2 and climate shown by the models in Figure 3.10, combined with a
range of climate sensitivities from 1.5 to 4.5°C rise for a doubling of
CO2. This approach yields a lower bound on uncertainties in the carbon
cycle and climate. The model ranges for Bern-CC were obtained by
combining different bounding assumptions about the behaviour of the
CO2 fertilisation effect, the response of heterotrophic respiration to
temperature and the turnover time of the ocean, thus approaching an
upper bound on uncertainties in the carbon cycle. The effect of varying
climate sensitivity from 1.5 to 4.5°C is shown separately for Bern-CC.
Both models adopted a “reference case” with mid-range behaviour of
the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity of 2.5°C.

3.7.3.1 Methods for assessing the response of atmospheric CO2
to different emissions pathways and model sensitivities

This  section  follows  the  approach  of  previous  IPCC  reports  in
using simplified, fast models (sometimes known as reduced-form
models)  to  assess  the  relationship  between  CO2 emissions  and
concentrations, under various assumptions about their future time
course.  Results  are  shown  from  two  models, whose  salient
features are summarised in Box 3.7. The models lend themselves
to somewhat different approaches to estimating uncertainties. In
the  ISAM  model, “high-CO2” and  “low-CO2” alternatives  are
calculated  for  every  emissions  scenario, based  on  tuning  the
model  to  match  the  range  of  responses  included  in  the  model

Box 3.7: Fast, simplified models used in this assessment.

The Bern-CC model comprises:

• A box-diffusion type ocean carbon model, (HILDA version K(z); Siegenthaler and Joos, 1992; Joos et al., 1996), already used in
the SAR. In addition to the SAR version, the effect of sea surface warming on carbonate chemistry is included (Joos et al., 1999b).

• An impulse-response climate model (Hooss et al., 1999), which converts radiative forcing into spatial patterns of changes in
temperature, precipitation  and  cloud  cover  on  a  global  grid. The  patterns  of  the  climate  anomalies  are  derived  from  the  first
principal  component  of  the  climate  response  shown  by  the  full  three-dimensional  atmosphere-ocean  GCM, ECHAM-3/LSG
(Voss and Mikolajewicz, 1999). Their magnitude is scaled according to the prescribed climate sensitivity.

• The terrestrial carbon model LPJ, as described in Sitch et al. (2000) and Cramer et al. (2001). LPJ is a process-based DGVM that
falls in the mid-range of CO2 and climate responses as shown in Cramer et al. (2001). It is used here at 3.75° × 2.5° resolution,
as in Cramer et al. (2001).

• A radiative forcing module. The radiative forcing of CO2, the concentration increase of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and their
radiative forcing, direct forcing due to sulphate, black carbon and organic aerosols, and indirect forcing due to sulphate aerosols
are projected using a variant of SAR models (Harvey et al., 1997; Fuglestvedt and Berntsen, 1999) updated with information
summarised in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. The concentrations of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, aerosol loadings, and radiative forcings are
consistent with those given in Appendix II.

Sensitivities  of  projected  CO2 concentrations  to  model  assumptions  were  assessed  as  follows.  Rh  was  assumed  either  to  be
independent of global warming (Giardina and Ryan, 2000; Jarvis and Linder 2000), or to increase with temperature according to
Lloyd  and  Taylor  (1994).  CO2 fertilisation  was  either  capped  after  year  2000  by  keeping  CO2 at  the  year  2000  value  in  the
photosynthesis module, or increased asymptotically following Haxeltine and Prentice (1996). (Although apparently unrealistic,
capping the CO2 fertilisation in the model is designed to mimic the possibility that other, transient factors such as land management
changes might be largely responsible for current terrestrial carbon uptake.) Transport parameters of the ocean model (including gas
exchange) were scaled by a factor of 1.5 and 0.5. Average ocean uptake for the 1980s is 2.0 PgC/yr in the reference case, 1.46
PgC/yr for the “slow ocean” and 2.54 PgC/yr for the “fast ocean”, roughly in accord with the range of observational estimates (Table
3.1, Section 3.2.3.2). A “low-CO2” parametrization was obtained by combining the fast ocean and no response of Rh to tempera-
ture. A “high-CO2” parametrization was obtained by combining the slow ocean and capping CO2 fertilisation. Climate sensitivity
was set at 2.5 °C for a doubling of CO2. Effects of varying climate sensitivity from 1.5°C to 4.5°C are also shown for one case.

The ISAM model was described by Jain et al. (1994) and used in the SAR for CO2-only analyses, with a different set of model
parameters from those used here (Jain, 2000). The full configuration of ISAM comprises:

• A globally aggregated upwelling-diffusion ocean model including the effects of temperature on CO2 solubility and carbonate

chemistry (Jain et al., 1995).

• An energy balance climate model of the type used in the IPCC 1990 assessment (Hoffert et al., 1980; Bretherton et al., 1990). In

this model, heat is transported as a tracer in the ocean and shares the same transport parameters as DIC.

• A six-box globally aggregated terrestrial carbon model including empirical parametrizations of CO2 fertilisation and temperature

effects on productivity and respiration (Harvey, 1989; Kheshgi et al., 1996). 

• The  radiative  forcing  of  CO2 projected  using  a  SAR  model  (Harvey  et  al., 1997)  modified  with  information  summarised  in

Chapter 6. Radiative forcing from agents other than CO2 are identical to that used in the Bern-CC model.

In addition to varying the climate sensitivity (1.5 to 4.5°C), parameters of the terrestrial and ocean components (strength of CO2
fertilisation, temperature response of NPP and heterotrophic respiration; ocean heat and DIC transport) were adjusted to mimic the
ranges of CO2 and climate responses as shown by existing process-based models (Figure 3.10). A reference case was defined with
climate sensitivity 2.5°C, ocean uptake corresponding to the mean of the ocean model results in Figure 3.10, and terrestrial uptake
corresponding to the mean of the responses of the mid-range models LPJ, IBIS and SDGVM (Figure 3.10). A “low CO2” parametri-
sation was chosen with climate sensitivity 1.5°C, and maximal CO2 uptake by oceans and land; and a “high-CO2” parametrization
with climate sensitivity 4.5°C, and minimal CO2 uptake by oceans and land.

222

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

intercomparisons shown in Figure 3.10. Uncertainties cited from
the ISAM model can be regarded as providing a lower bound on
uncertainty since they do not admit possible behaviours outside
the range considered in recent modelling studies. In the Bern-CC
model, “high-CO2” and “low-CO2” alternatives are calculated by
making bounding assumptions about carbon cycle processes (for
example, in  the  high-CO2 parametrization  CO2 fertilisation  is
capped at year 2000; in the low-CO2 parametrization Rh does not
increase  with  warming).  This  approach  yields  generally  larger
ranges of projected CO2 concentrations than the ISAM approach.
The  ranges  cited  from  the  Bern-CC  model  can  be  regarded  as
approaching an upper bound on uncertainty, since the true system
response is likely to be less extreme than the bounding assump-
tions, and because the combination of “best” and “worst” case
assumptions for every process is intrinsically unlikely.

3.7.3.2 Concentration projections based on IS92a, for 

comparison with previous studies

Illustrative model runs (Figure 3.11) based on the IS92a scenario
(Leggett et al., 1992) are shown first so as to allow comparison with
earlier model results presented in the SAR and the SRRF (Schimel
et al., 1995). In the SRRF comparison of eighteen global carbon
cycle models (Enting et al., 1994; Schimel et al., 1995) the CO2
fertilisation response of the land was calibrated to match the central
estimate  of  the  global  carbon  budget  for  the  1980s, assuming  a
land-use  source  of  1.6  PgC/yr  in  the  1980s  and  attributing  the
residual terrestrial sink to CO2 fertilisation. This intercomparison
yielded  CO2 concentrations  in  2100  of  668  to  734  ppm;  results
presented in Schimel et al. (1996) (from the Bern model) gave 688
ppm. After recalibrating to match a presumed land-use source of
1.1  PgC/yr, implying  a  weaker  CO2 response, the  2100  CO2
concentration was given as 712 ppm in the SAR (Schimel et al.,
1996). An IPCC Technical Paper (Wigley et al., 1997) evaluated the
sensitivity of IS92a results to this calibration procedure. Wigley et
al., (1997) found that a range of assumed values from 0.4 to 1.8
PgC/yr for the land-use source during the 1980s gave rise to a range
of 2100 CO2 concentrations from 667 to 766 ppm. 

In contrast with the SAR, the results presented here are based
on  approximating  the  behaviour  of  spatially  resolved  process-
based  models  in  which  CO2 and  climate  responses  are  not
constrained by prior assumptions about the global carbon budget.
The  CO2-only  response  of  both  models’ reference  cases  (Figure
3.11) leads to a 2100 CO2 concentration of 682 ppm (ISAM) or
651 ppm (Bern-CC). These values are slightly lower than projected
in the SAR − 715 ppm (ISAM; SAR version) and 712 ppm (Bern
Model; SAR version) − because current process-based terrestrial
models typically yield a stronger CO2 response than was assumed
in  the  SAR.  With  climate  feedbacks  included, the  2100  CO2
concentration  in  the  reference  case  becomes, by  coincidence,
effectively indistinguishable from that given in the SAR: 723 ppm
(ISAM) and 706 ppm (Bern-CC). The ranges of 164 ppm or −12%
/ +11% (about the reference case) (ISAM) and 273 ppm or −10%
/  +28%  (Bern-CC)  in  the  2100  CO2 concentration  indicate  that
there  is  significant  uncertainty  about  the  future  CO2 concentra-
tions due to any one pathway of changes in emissions. Separate
calculations with the Bern-CC model (Figure 3.11) show that the
effect of changing climate sensitivity alone is less important than

scenarios. The SRES scenarios represent the outcome of different
assumptions about the future course of economic development,

shows CO2 emissions for the selected scenarios and panels (b) and
(c) show resulting CO2 concentrations as projected by two fast

Figure 3.11. For each model, and each scenario the reference case is
shown by a black line, the upper bound (high-CO2 parametrization)
is indicated by the top of the coloured area, and the lower bound

the  effect  of  varying  assumptions  in  the  carbon  cycle  model’s
components. The effect of increasing climate sensitivity to 4.5
°C  (increasing  the  climate  feedback)  is  much  larger  than  the
effect of reducing climate sensitivity to 1.5 °C. The “low-CO2”
parametrization of Bern-CC yields CO2 concentrations closer to
the  reference  case  than  the  “high-CO2” parametrization, in
which the terrestrial sink is forced to approach zero during the
first few decades of the century due to the capping of the CO2
fertilisation effect.

The  reference  simulations  with  ISAM  yielded  an  implied
average land-use source during the 1980s of 0.9 PgC/yr. The range
was 0.2 to 2.0 PgC/yr. Corresponding values for Bern-CC were
0.6 PgC/yr and a range of 0.0 to 1.5 PgC/yr. These ranges broadly
overlap the range estimates of the 1980s land-use source given in
Table 3.1. Present knowledge of the carbon budget is therefore not
precise enough to allow much narrowing of the uncertainty associ-
ated  with  future  land  and  ocean  uptake  as  expressed  in  these
projections. However, the lowest implied land-use source values
fall below the range given in Table 3.1. 

3.7.3.3 SRES scenarios and their implications for future CO2

concentration

The  Special  Report  on  Emissions  Scenarios  (SRES)  (IPCC,
2000b) produced a series of scenarios, of which six are used here,
representing outcomes of distinct narratives of economic develop-
ment and demographic and technological change. In ISAM model
runs with these scenarios, past fossil emissions (see Section 3.4.1),
CO2 concentrations  (Enting  et  al., 1994;  Keeling  and  Whorf,
2000)  and  mean  global  temperatures  (Jones  et  al., 2000)  were
specified  up  to  and  including  1999;  scenario-based  analyses
started  in  2000.  In  the  Bern-CC  model  runs, observed  CO2
(Etheridge, et al., 1996, Keeling and Whorf, 2000) and past fossil
emissions (Marland et al., 1999) were prescribed, and historical
temperature  changes  were  modelled, based  on  radiative  forcing
from  greenhouse  gases  and  aerosols;  again, scenario-based
analyses started in 2000. Past emissions from changing land use
were calculated in order to balance the carbon budget.

The six scenarios lead to substantial differences in projected
CO2 concentration  trajectories  (Figure  3.12).  Significant
uncertainties are introduced by the range of model parametriza-
tions considered, so that the trajectories calculated for “adjacent”
scenarios  overlap, especially  during  the  first  half-century.  The
reference cases of the six scenarios account for a range of 2100
CO2 concentrations from 541 to 963 ppm in the Bern-CC model
and 549 to 970 ppm in the ISAM model. The uncertainties around
the 2100 values due to model parametrizations are −12 to +10 %
(ISAM) and −14 to +31 % (Bern-CC).

These  uncertainties  reflect  incomplete  understanding  of
climate sensitivity and the carbon cycle. They substantially limit
our  current  ability  to  make  quantitative  predictions  about  the
future consequences of a given emissions trajectory. Nevertheless,
the results show that higher emissions are always expected to lead
to higher projected atmospheric concentrations. They also show
that  the  range  of  emissions  scenarios  currently  accepted  as
plausible leads to a range of CO2 concentrations that exceeds the
likely  upper  bound  of  uncertainties  due  to  differences  among
model parameterizations and assumptions.

Fig 3.13: Projected CO2 emissions leading to stabilisation of
atmospheric CO2 concentrations at different final values. Panel (a)
shows the assumed trajectories of CO2 concentration (WRE
scenarios; Wigley et al., 1996) and panels (b) and (c) show the
implied CO2 emissions, as projected with two fast carbon cycle
models, Bern-CC and ISAM (see Box 3.7 and Figure 3.11). The
ranges represent effects of different model parametrizations and
assumptions as indicated in the text and in the caption to Figure 3.11.
For each model, the upper and lower bounds (corresponding to low-
and high-CO2 parametrizations, respectively) are indicated by the top
and bottom of the shaded area. Alternatively, the lower bound (where
hidden) is indicated by a dashed line.

The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

3.7.3.4  Stabilisation scenarios and their implications for future 

CO2 emissions

Stabilisation  scenarios  illustrate  implied  rates  of  CO2 emission
that  would  arrive  at  various  stable  CO2 concentration  levels.
These have been projected using a similar methodology to that
applied in the analysis of emissions scenarios. The WRE trajec-
tories  follow  CO2 concentrations  consistent  with  the  IS92a
scenario beginning in 1990 and branch off to reach constant CO2
concentrations of 450, 550, 650, 750 and 1,000 ppm (Wigley et
al., 1996). The rationale for various alternative time trajectories
and  stabilisation  levels  is  discussed  in  Chapter  2  of  the  IPCC
WGIII  Third  Assessment  Report  (Morita  et  al., 2001).
Differences in emissions pathways for different time trajectories
leading  to  a  certain  stabilisation  target  (e.g., S  versus  WRE
profiles) are discussed in Schimel et al., (1997). Here, we have
calculated emissions for one set of emission profiles to illustrate
differences in implied emissions that arise from updating models
since the SAR. 

As in Section 3.7.3.2, the models were initialised up to present.
Then anthropogenic emissions for the prescribed CO2 stabilization
profiles were calculated; deduced emissions equal the change in
modeled  ocean  and  terrestrial  carbon  inventories  plus  the
prescribed  change  in  atmospheric  CO2 content.  To  estimate  the
strength  of  carbon  cycle-climate  feedbacks, global  temperature
(ISAM) and changes in the fields of temperature, precipitation and
cloud cover (Bern-CC) were projected from CO2 radiative forcing
only, neglecting  effects  of  other  greenhouse  gases  and  aerosols
which are not specified in the WRE profiles. The results for the
reference cases are not substantially different from those presented
in the SAR (Figure 3.13). However, the range based on alternative
model parametrizations is larger than presented in the SAR, mainly
due to the range of simulated terrestrial CO2 uptake. CO2 stabilisa-
tion at 450, 650 or 1,000ppm would require global anthropogenic
CO2 emissions to drop below 1990 levels, within a few decades,
about a century, or about two centuries, respectively.

In all cases, once CO2 concentration becomes constant, the
implied anthropogenic emission declines steadily. This result was
expected. It highlights the fact that to maintain a constant future
CO2 concentration, anthropogenic  CO2 emissions  would
ultimately  have  to  be  reduced  to  the  level  of  persistent  natural
sinks.  Persistent  terrestrial  sinks  are  not  well  quantified;
peatlands may be a candidate, but the gradual rise in atmospheric
CO2 concentration  during  the  present  interglacial  (Figure  3.2)
argues  against  any  such  sink.  Estimates  of  current  uptake  by
peatlands are <0.1 PgC/yr (Clymo et al., 1998). Mixing of ocean
DIC between surface and deep waters should continue to produce
ocean uptake for several centuries after an input of anthropogenic
atmospheric  CO2 (Siegenthaler  and  Oeschger, 1978;  Maier-
Reimer  and  Hasselmann, 1987;  Sarmiento  et  al., 1992).  This
mixing  is  the  main  reason  for  continued  uptake  (and  therefore
positive  calculated  emissions)  after  stabilisation.  However, the
main, known natural sink expected to persist longer than a few
centuries is that due to dissolution of CaCO3 in ocean sediments,
which  increases  ocean  alkalinity  and  thereby  allows  additional
CO2 to dissolve in the ocean. For CO2 concentrations about 1,000
ppm, this sink is estimated to be smaller than about −0.1 PgC/yr
(Archer et al., 1998). Thus, for any significant CO2 emissions to

persist over centuries without continuing to increase atmospheric
CO2 would require some method of producing an artificial carbon
sink.

3.7.4 Conclusions

The differences among the CO2 concentrations projected with the
various SRES scenarios considered are larger than the differences
caused by inclusion or omission of climate-mediated feedbacks.
The range of uptake rates projected by process-based models for
any one scenario is, however, considerable, due to uncertainties
about  (especially)  terrestrial  ecosystem  responses  to  high  CO2
concentrations, which have not yet been resolved experimentally,
and uncertainties about the response of global NPP to changes in
climate  (Cramer  et  al., 1999).  A  smaller  feedback  would  be
implied if, as some models indicate, global NPP increases with
warming throughout the relevant range of climates and no forest
die  back  occurs.  Larger  positive  feedbacks  would  be  implied  if
regional drying caused partial die back of tropical forests, as some
of the DGVMs in Cramer et al. (2001), and one coupled climate-
carbon  model  study  of  Cox  et  al. (2000), suggest;  however,
another coupled climate-carbon model study (Friedlingstein et al.,
2001) suggests a smaller feedback. Uncertainty also arises due to
differences in the climate responses of ocean models, especially as
regards the extent and effects (biological as well as physical) of
increased stratification in a warmer climate (Joos et al., 1999b).

In  conclusion, anthropogenic  CO2 emissions  are  virtually
certain to be the dominant factor determining CO2 concentrations
throughout  the  21st  century. The  importance  of  anthropogenic
emissions is underlined by the expectation that the proportion of
emissions taken up by both ocean and land will decline at high
atmospheric CO2 concentrations (even if absolute uptake by the
ocean  continues  to  rise).  There  is  considerable  uncertainty  in
projections  of  future  CO2 concentration, because  of  uncertainty
about the effects of climate change on the processes determining
ocean and land uptake of CO2. These uncertainties do not negate
the main finding that anthropogenic emissions will be the main
control.

Large-scale manipulations of terrestrial ecosystems have been
proposed as a means of slowing the increase of atmospheric CO2
during  the  21st  century  in  support  of  the  aims  of  the  Kyoto
Protocol  (Tans  and  Wallace, 1999;  IPCC, 2000a).  Based  on
current understanding of land use in the carbon cycle, the impacts
of future land use on terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchanges
have the potential to modify atmospheric CO2 concentrations on
this time-scale. Direct effects of land-use changes are thought to
represent about 10 to 30% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions
(Table  3.1), so  there  is  scope  for  either  intended  or  unintended
changes  in  land  use  to  reduce  or  increase  total  anthropogenic
emissions. But the possibilities for enhancing natural sinks have to
be placed in perspective: a rough upper bound for the reduction in
CO2 concentration that could be achieved by enhancing terrestrial
carbon uptake through land-use change over the coming century
is 40 to 70 ppm (Section 3.2.2.2), to be considered against a two
to four times larger potential for increasing CO2 concentraion by
deforestation, and a >400 ppm range among the SRES scenarios
(Figure 3.12).

Executive Summary

Two  important  new  findings  since  the  IPCC  WGI  Second
Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter SAR) demonstrate the
importance  of  atmospheric  chemistry  in  controlling  greenhouse
gases:

Currently, tropospheric ozone (O3) is the third most important
greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). It
is  a  product  of  photochemistry, and  its  future  abundance  is
controlled primarily by emissions of CH4, carbon monoxide (CO),
nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOC).
There is now greater confidence in the model assessment of the
increase in tropospheric O3 since the pre-industrial period, which
amounts to 30% when globally averaged, as well as the response
to future emissions. For scenarios in which the CH4 abundance
doubles  and  anthropogenic  CO  and  NOx emissions  triple, the
tropospheric  O3 abundance  is  predicted  to  increase  by  an
additional 50% above today’s abundance.

CO is identified as an important indirect greenhouse gas. An
addition  of  CO  to  the  atmosphere  perturbs  the  OH-CH4-O3
chemistry. Model calculations indicate that the emission of 100
Mt of CO stimulates an atmospheric chemistry perturbation that is
equivalent to direct emission of about 5 Mt of CH4. 

A major conclusion of this report is that atmospheric abundances
of almost all greenhouse gases reached the highest values in their
measurement records during the 1990s:

The  atmospheric  abundance  of  CH4 continues  to  increase,
from about 1,520 ppb in 1978 to 1,745 ppb in 1998. However, the
observed annual increase in CH4 has declined during the last two
decades. This increase is highly variable; it was near zero in 1992
and as large as +13 ppb during 1998. There is no clear, quantita-
tive explanation for this variability. Since the SAR, quantification
of certain anthropogenic sources of CH4, such as that from rice
production, has improved.

The atmospheric burden of nitrous oxide (N2O) continues to
increase by about 0.25%/yr. New, higher estimates of emissions
from agricultural sources improve our understanding of the global
N2O budget.

The atmospheric abundances of major greenhouse gases that
deplete  stratospheric  ozone  are  decreasing  (CFC-11, CFC-113,
CH3CCl3, CCl4), or increasing more slowly (CFC-12), in response
to the phase-out in their production agreed to under the Montreal
Protocol and its Amendments. 

HFC-152a and HFC-134a are increasing in the atmosphere.
This growth is consistent with the rise in their industrial use. HFC-
23, an  unintended  by-product  of  HCFC-22  production, is  also
increasing.

Perfluorocarbon (PFC) e.g., CF4 (perfluoromethane) appears
to  have  a  natural  background;  however, current  anthropogenic
emissions exceed natural ones by a factor of 1,000 or more and are
responsible for the observed increase.

There is good agreement between the increase in atmospheric
abundances of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and emissions estimates
based on revised sales and storage data.

There has been little increase in global tropospheric O3 since
the  1980s  at  the  few  remote  locations  where  it  is  regularly

measured. Only two of the fourteen stations, one in Japan and one
in Europe, had statistically significant increases in tropospheric O3
between 1980 and 1995. By contrast, the four Canadian stations,
all at high latitudes, had significant decreases in tropospheric O3
for the same time period. However, limited observations from
the  late  19th  and  early  20th  centuries  combined  with  models
suggest that tropospheric O3 has increased from a global mean
value of 25 DU (where 1 DU = 2.7⫻1016 O3 molecules/cm2) in
the pre-industrial era to 34 DU today. While the SAR estimated
similar  values, the  new  analysis  provides  more  confidence  in
this increase of 9 DU. 

Changes  in  atmospheric  composition  and  chemistry  over  the
past century have affected, and those projected into the future
will  affect, the  lifetimes  of  many  greenhouse  gases  and  thus
alter the climate forcing of anthropogenic emissions:

The atmospheric lifetime relates emissions of a component
to  its  atmospheric  burden.  In  some  cases, for  instance  for
methane, a change in emissions perturbs the chemistry and thus
the corresponding lifetime. The  CH4 feedback effect amplifies
the  climate  forcing  of  an  addition  of  CH4 to  the  current
atmosphere by lengthening the perturbation lifetime relative to
the global atmospheric lifetime of CH4 by a factor of 1.4. This
earlier finding is corroborated here by new model studies that
also  predict  only  small  changes  in  this  CH4 feedback  for  the
different  scenarios  projected  to  year  2100.  Another  feedback
has been identified for the addition of N2O to the atmosphere;
it is associated with stratospheric O3 chemistry and shortens the
perturbation lifetime relative to the global atmospheric lifetime
of N2O by about 5%. 

Several chemically reactive gases – CO, NOx (=NO+NO2),
and  VOC  –  control  in  part  the  abundance  of  O3 and  the
oxidising  capacity  (OH)  of  the  troposphere.  These  pollutants
act  as  indirect  greenhouse  gases  through  their  influence  on
atmospheric  chemistry, e.g., formation  of  tropospheric  O3 or
changing the lifetime of CH4. The emissions of NOx and CO are
dominated  by  human  activities.  The  abundance  of  CO  in  the
Northern  Hemisphere  is  about  twice  that  in  the  Southern
Hemisphere  and  has  increased  in  the  second  half  of  the  20th
century along with industrialisation and population. The urban
and  regional  abundance  of  NOx has  generally  increased  with
industrialisation, but  the  global  abundance  of  this  short-lived,
highly variable pollutant cannot be derived from measurements.
Increased NOx abundances will in general increase tropospheric
O3 and  decrease  CH4.  Deposition  of  NOx reaction  products
fertilises  the  biosphere, stimulates  CO2 uptake, but  also
provides an input of acidic precipitation. 

The  IPCC  Special  Report  on  Emission  Scenarios  (SRES)
generated six marker/illustrative scenarios (labelled A1B, A1T,
A1FI, A2, B1, B2)  plus  four  preliminary  marker  scenarios
(labelled  here  A1p, A2p, B1p, and  B2p).  These  projected
changes  in  anthropogenic  emissions  of  trace  gases  from  year
2000 to year 2100, making different assumptions on population
development, energy use, and technology. Results from both sets
of  scenarios  are  discussed  here  since  the  preliminary  marker
scenarios (December 1998) were used in this report:

242

Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases

Model  calculations  of  the  abundances  of  the  primary
greenhouse  gases  by  year  2100  vary  considerably  across  the
SRES scenarios: in general A1B, A1T, and B1 have the smallest
increases of emissions and burdens; and A1FI and A2 the largest.
CH4 changes from 1998 to 2100 range from −10 to +115%; and
N2O increases from 13 to 47%. The HFCs – 134a, 143a, and 125
–  reach  abundances  of  a  few  hundred  to  nearly  a  thousand  ppt
from negligible levels today. The PFC CF4 is projected to increase
to between 200 and 400 ppt; and SF6 to between 35 and 65 ppt.
SRES  projected  anthropogenic  emissions  of  the  indirect
greenhouse gases (NOx, CO and VOC) together with changes in
CH4 are expected to change the global mean abundance of tropo-
spheric OH by −20 to +6% over the next century. Comparable, but
opposite sign, changes occur in the atmospheric lifetimes of the
greenhouse gases, CH4 and HFCs. This impact depends in large
part on the magnitude of, and the balance between, NOx and CO
emissions.

For the SRES scenarios, changes in tropospheric O3 between
years  2000  and  2100  range  from  −4  to  +21  DU.  The  largest
increase predicted for the 21st century (scenarios A1FI and A2)
would be more than twice as large as that experienced since the
pre-industrial  era.  These  O3 increases  are  attributable  to  the
concurrent, large (almost factor of 3) increases in anthropogenic
NOx and CH4 emissions. 

The  large  growth  in  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  and  other
pollutants  as  projected  in  some  SRES  scenarios  for  the  21st
century  will  degrade  the  global  environment  in  ways  beyond
climate change:

Changes projected in the SRES A2 and A1FI scenarios would
degrade  air  quality  over  much  of  the  globe  by  increasing
background  levels  of  O3.  In  northern  mid-latitudes  during
summer, the zonal average increases near the surface are about 30
ppb or more, raising background levels to nearly 80 ppb, threat-

ening attainment of air quality standards over most metropolitan
and even rural regions, and compromising crop and forest produc-
tivity. This problem reaches across continental boundaries since
emissions  of  NOx influence  photochemistry  on  a  hemispheric
scale.

A more complete and accurate assessment of the human impact on
greenhouse  gases  requires  greater  understanding  of  sources,
processes, and  coupling  between  different  parts  of  the  climate
system:

The current assessment is notably incomplete in calculating
the total impact of individual industrial / agricultural sectors on
greenhouse  gases  and  aerosols.  The  IPCC  Special  Report  on
Aviation  demonstrates  that  the  total  impact  of  a  sector  is  not
represented by (nor scalable to) the direct emissions of primary
greenhouse  gases  alone, but  needs  to  consider  a  wide  range  of
atmospheric changes. 

The ability to hindcast the detailed changes in atmospheric
composition over the past decade, particularly the variability of
tropospheric O3 and CO, is limited by the availability of measure-
ments  and  their  integration  with  models  and  emissions  data.
Nevertheless, since the SAR there have been substantial advances
in measurement techniques, field campaigns, laboratory studies,
global networks, satellite observations, and coupled models that
have improved the level of scientific understanding of this assess-
ment.  Better  simulation  of  the  past  two  decades, and  in  due
course the upcoming one, would reduce uncertainty ranges and
improve  the  confidence  level  of  our  projections  of  greenhouse
gases. 

Feedbacks between atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the
biosphere  were  not  developed  to  the  stage  that  they  could  be
included in the projected numbers here. Failure to include such
coupling is likely to lead to systematic errors and may substan-
tially alter the projected increases in the major greenhouse gases.

4.1 Introduction

This  chapter  investigates  greenhouse  gases  whose  atmospheric
burdens1 and climate impacts generally depend on atmospheric
chemistry.  These  greenhouse  gases  include  those  listed  in  the
Kyoto  Protocol  –  methane  (CH4), nitrous  oxide  (N2O), hydro-
fluorocarbons  (HFCs), perfluorocarbons  (PFCs), sulphur
hexafluoride (SF6) – and those listed under the Montreal Protocol
and  its  Amendments  –  the  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs), the
hydrochlorofluorocarbons  (HCFCs), and  the  halons.  A  major
focus of this assessment is the change in tropospheric ozone (O3).
Stratospheric water vapour (H2O) is also treated here, but tropo-
spheric  H2O, which  is  part  of  the  hydrological  cycle  and
calculated within climate models, is not discussed. This chapter
also  treats  the  reactive  gases  carbon  monoxide  (CO), volatile
organic  compounds  (VOC), and  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx =
NO+NO2), termed  indirect  greenhouse  gases.  These  pollutants
are  not  significant  direct  greenhouse  gases, but  through
atmospheric  chemistry  they  control  the  abundances1 of  direct
greenhouse gases. This chapter reviews the factors controlling the
current  atmospheric  abundances  of  direct  and  indirect
greenhouse gases; it looks at the changes since the pre-industrial
era  and  their  attribution  to  anthropogenic  activities;  and  it
calculates  atmospheric  abundances  to  the  year  2100  based  on
projected emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants. Carbon
dioxide (CO2) is treated in Chapter 3; and aerosols in Chapter 5.
The atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and aerosols
from all chapters are combined in Chapter 6 to calculate current
and  future  radiative  forcing.  This  chapter  is  an  update  of  the
IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) (hereafter
SAR).  For  a  review  of  the  chemical  processes  controlling  the
abundance of greenhouse gases see the SAR (Prather et al., 1995)
or  Ehhalt  (1999).  More  recent  assessments  of  changing
atmospheric  chemistry  and  composition  include  the  IPCC
Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere (Penner
et al., 1999) and the World Meteorological Organization / United
Nations  Environmental  Programme  (WMO/UNEP)  Scientific
Assessment of Ozone Depletion (WMO, 1999).

4.1.1 Sources of Greenhouse Gases

Substantial, pre-industrial  abundances  for  CH4 and  N2O  are
found in the tiny bubbles of ancient air trapped in ice cores. Both
gases have large, natural emission rates, which have varied over
past  climatic  changes  but  have  sustained  a  stable  atmospheric
abundance for the centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution (see
Figures 4.1 and 4.2). Emissions of CH4 and N2O due to human
activities  are  also  substantial  and  have  caused  large  relative

1 Atmospheric abundances for trace gases are reported here as the mole
fraction (molar mixing ratio) of the gas relative to dry air (ppm = 10−6, ppb
= 10−9, ppt = 10−12); whereas the burden is reported as the total mass of
that gas in the atmosphere (e.g., Mt = Tg = 1012 g). For most trace gases
in this chapter, the burden is based on the total weight of the molecule; for
the N-containing gases, it includes only the mass of the N; and for some
VOC budgets where noted, it includes only the mass of the C.

increases  in  their  respective  burdens  over  the  last  century. The
atmospheric burdens of CH4 and N2O over the next century will
likely  be  driven  by  changes  in  both  anthropogenic  and  natural
sources.  A  second  class  of  greenhouse  gases  –  the  synthetic
HFCs, PFCs, SF6, CFCs, and  halons  –  did  not  exist  in  the
atmosphere before the 20th century (Butler et al., 1999). CF4, a
PFC, is detected in ice cores and appears to have an extremely
small  natural  source  (Harnisch  and  Eisenhauer, 1998).  The
current burdens of these latter gases are derived from atmospheric
observations and represent accumulations of past anthropogenic
releases; their future burdens depend almost solely on industrial
production  and  release  to  the  atmosphere.  Stratospheric  H2O
could increase, driven by in situ sources, such as the oxidation of
CH4 and exhaust from aviation, or by a changing climate.

Tropospheric  O3 is  both  generated  and  destroyed  by
photochemistry  within  the  atmosphere.  Its  in  situ sources  are
expected to have grown with the increasing industrial emissions
of its precursors: CH4, NOx, CO and VOC. In addition, there is
substantial  transport  of  ozone  from  the  stratosphere  to  the
troposphere (see also Section 4.2.4). The effects of stratospheric
O3 depletion over the past three decades and the projections of
its  recovery, following  cessation  of  emissions  of  the  Montreal
Protocol gases, was recently assessed (WMO, 1999).

The current global emissions, mean abundances, and trends
of  the  gases  mentioned  above  are  summarised  in  Table  4.1a.
Table  4.1b  lists  additional  synthetic  greenhouse  gases  without
established atmospheric abundances. For the Montreal Protocol
gases, political  regulation  has  led  to  a  phase-out  of  emissions
that has slowed their atmospheric increases, or turned them into
decreases, such as for CFC-11. For other greenhouse gases, the
anthropogenic  emissions  are  projected  to  increase  or  remain
high in the absence of climate-policy regulations. Projections of
future  emissions  for  this  assessment, i.e., the  IPCC  Special
Report  on  Emission  Scenarios  (SRES)  (Nakic´enovic´ et  al.,
2000)  anticipate  future  development  of  industries  and  agricul-
ture  that  represent  major  sources  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the
absence  of  climate-policy  regulations.  The  first  draft  of  this
chapter and many of the climate studies in this report used the
greenhouse gas concentrations derived from the SRES prelimi-
nary  marker  scenarios  (i.e., the  SRES  database  as  of  January
1999 and labelled ‘p’ here). The scenario IS92a has been carried
along in many tables to provide a reference of the changes since
the SAR. The projections of greenhouse gases and aerosols for
the  six  new  SRES  marker/illustrative  scenarios  are  discussed
here and tabulated in Appendix II.

An  important  policy  issue  is  the  complete  impact  of
different  industrial  or  agricultural  sectors  on  climate.  This
requires  aggregation  of  the  SRES  scenarios  by  sector  (e.g.,
transportation) or sub-sector (e.g., aviation; Penner et al., 1999),
including  not  only  emissions  but  also  changes  in  land  use  or
natural  ecosystems.  Due  to  chemical  coupling, correlated
emissions can have synergistic effects; for instance NOx and CO
from transportation produce regional O3 increases. Thus a given
sector may act through several channels on the future trends of
greenhouse  gases.  In  this  chapter  we  will  evaluate  the  data
available on this subject in the current literature and in the SRES
scenarios.

4.1.2 Atmospheric Chemistry and Feedbacks

All greenhouse gases except CO2 and H2O are removed from the
atmosphere  primarily  by  chemical  processes  within  the
atmosphere. Greenhouse gases containing one or more H atoms
(e.g., CH4, HFCs  and  HCFCs), as  well  as  other  pollutants, are
removed primarily by the reaction with hydroxyl radicals (OH).
This removal takes place in the troposphere, the lowermost part
of  the  atmosphere, ranging  from  the  surface  up  to  7  to  16  km
depending on latitude and season and containing 80% of the mass

of the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases N2O, PFCs, SF6, CFCs
and halons do not react with OH in the troposphere. These gases
are  destroyed  in  the  stratosphere  or  above, mainly  by  solar
ultraviolet radiation (UV) at short wavelengths (<240 nm), and
are  long-lived.  Because  of  the  time  required  to  transport  these
gases  to  the  region  of  chemical  loss, they  have  a  minimum
lifetime  of  about  20  years.  CO2 is  practically  inert  in  the
atmosphere and does not directly influence the chemistry, but it
has  a  small  in  situ source  from  the  oxidation  of  CH4, CO  and
VOC. 

246

Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases

Tropospheric  OH  abundances  depend  on  abundances  of
NOx, CH4, CO, VOC, O3 and H2O plus the amount of solar UV
(>300 nm) that reaches the troposphere. As a consequence, OH
varies  widely  with  geographical  location, time  of  day, and
season. Likewise the local loss rates of all those gases reacting
with  OH  also  vary.  Because  of  its  dependence  on  CH4 and
other pollutants, tropospheric OH is expected to have changed
since  the  pre-industrial  era  and  to  change  again  for  future
emission  scenarios.  For  some  of  these  gases  other  removal
processes, such  as  photolysis  or  surface  uptake, are  also
important;  and  the  total  sink  of  the  gas  is  obtained  by
integrating  over  all  such  processes. The  chemistry  of  tropos-
pheric O3 is closely tied to that of OH, and its abundance also
varies with changing precursor emissions. The chemistry of the
troposphere  is  also  directly  influenced  by  the  stratospheric
burden  of  O3, climatic  changes  in  temperature  (T)  and
humidity  (H2O), as  well  as  by  interactions  between  tropo-
spheric  aerosols  and  trace  gases.  Such  couplings  provide  a
“feedback” between the climate change induced by increasing
greenhouse gases and the concentration of these gases. Another
feedback, internal to the chemistry, is the impact of CH4 on OH
and  hence  its  own  loss.  These  feedbacks  are  expected  to  be
important  for  tropospheric  O3 and  OH.  Such  chemistry-
chemistry or climate-chemistry coupling has been listed under
“indirect effects” in the SAR (Prather et al., 1995; Schimel et
al., 1996). 

This chapter uses 3-D chemistry-transport models (CTMs)
to  integrate  the  varying  chemical  processes  over  global
conditions, to estimate their significance, and to translate the
emission scenarios into abundance changes in the greenhouse
gases  CH4, HFCs, and  O3.  An  extensive  modelling  exercise
called  OxComp  (tropospheric  oxidant  model  comparison)  –
involving model comparisons, sensitivity studies, and investi-
gation of the IPCC SRES scenarios – was organised to support
this report.

Stratospheric circulation and distribution of O3 control the
transport  of  the  long-lived  greenhouse  gases  to  regions  of
photochemical loss as well as the penetration of solar UV into
the atmosphere. At the same time, many of these gases (e.g.,
N2O  and  CFCs)  supply  ozone-depleting  radicals  (e.g., nitric
oxide (NO) and Cl) to the stratosphere, providing a feedback
between the gas and its loss rate. Another consequence of the
observed  stratospheric  ozone  depletion  is  that  tropospheric
photochemical activity is expected to have increased, altering
tropospheric OH and O3. Climate change in the 21st century,
including the radiative cooling of the stratosphere by increased
levels of CO2, is expected to alter stratospheric circulation and
O3, and, hence, the  global  mean  loss  rates  of  the  long-lived
gases. Some of these effects are discussed in WMO (1999) and
are briefly considered here.

The biosphere’s response to global change will impact the
atmospheric composition of the 21st century. The anticipated
changes  in  climate  (e.g., temperature, precipitation)  and  in
chemistry  will  alter  ecosystems  and  thus  the  “natural”,
background  emissions  of  trace  gases.  There  is  accumulating
evidence  that  increased  N  deposition  (the  result  of  NOx and
ammonia  (NH3)  emissions)  and  elevated  surface  O3

abundances have opposite influences on plant CO2 uptake: O3
(>40 ppb) inhibits CO2 uptake; while N deposition enhances it
up to a threshold, above which the effects are detrimental. In
addition, the increased N availability from atmospheric deposi-
tion  and  direct  fertilisation  accelerates  the  emission  of  N-
containing trace gases (NO, N2O and NH3) and CH4, as well as
altering  species  diversity  and  biospheric  functioning.  These
complex interactions represent a chemistry-biosphere feedback
that may alter greenhouse forcing. 

4.1.3 Trace Gas Budgets and Trends

The  “budget” of  a  trace  gas  consists  of  three  quantities: its
global source, global sink and atmospheric burden. The burden
is  defined  as  the  total  mass  of  the  gas  integrated  over  the
atmosphere  and  related  reservoirs, which  usually  include  just
the troposphere and stratosphere. The global burden (in Tg) and
its  trend  (i.e., the  difference  between  sources  and  sinks, in
Tg/yr) can be determined from atmospheric measurements and,
for the long-lived gases, are usually the best-known quantities
in  the  budgets.  For  short-lived, highly  variable  gases  such  as
tropospheric  O3 and  NOx, the  atmospheric  burden  cannot  be
measured with great accuracy. The global source strength is the
sum  of  all  sources, including  emissions  and  in  situ chemical
production. Likewise, the sink strength (or global loss rate) can
have several independent components. 

The source strength (Tg/yr) for most greenhouse gases is
comprised  of  surface  emissions.  For  synthetic  gases  where
industrial  production  and  emissions  are  well  documented, the
source strengths may be accurately known. For CH4 and N2O,
however, there are large, not well-quantified, natural emissions.
Further, the  anthropogenic  emissions  of  these  gases  are
primarily associated with agricultural sources that are difficult
to  quantify  accurately.  Considerable  research  has  gone  into
identifying  and  quantifying  the  emissions  from  individual
sources for CH4 and N2O, as discussed below. Such uncertainty
in source strength also holds for synthetic gases with undocu-
mented  emissions.  The  source  strength  for  tropospheric  O3
includes both a stratospheric influx and in situ production and
is thus derived primarily from global chemical models.

The  sink  strength  (Tg/yr)  of  long-lived  greenhouse  gases
can  be  derived  from  a  combination  of  atmospheric  observa-
tions, laboratory  experiments, and  models.  The  atmospheric
chemistry models are based on physical principles and labora-
tory data, and include as constraints the observed chemistry of
the atmosphere over the past two decades. For example, strato-
spheric loss rates are derived from models either by combining
observed  trace  gas  distributions  with  theoretically  calculated
loss frequencies or from the measured correlation of the respec-
tive gas with a trace gas of known vertical flux. In such analyses
there are a wide range of self-consistency checks. Mean global
loss  rates  based  on  a  priori modelling  (e.g., the  CH4-lifetime
studies  from  OxComp  described  later)  can  be  compared  with
empirically-based  loss  rates  that  are  scaled  from  a  gas  with
similar  loss  processes  that  has  well-known  emissions  and
atmospheric  burden  (e.g., the  AGAGE  (Advanced  Global
Atmospheric  Gases  Experiment)  calibration  of  mean  tropo-

spheric OH using methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3); Prinn et al.,
1995).  Our  knowledge  of  the  current  budget  of  a  greenhouse
gas provides a key constraint in modelling its future abundance.
For example, in both the IS92a and SRES projected emissions
of  CH4 and  N2O, we  apply  a  constant  offset  to  each  set  of
emissions so that our calculated burden is consistent with the
observed budget and trend during the 1990s.

4.1.4 Atmospheric Lifetimes and Time-Scales

The  global  atmospheric  lifetime  (yr)  characterises  the  time
required  to  turn  over  the  global  atmospheric  burden.  It  is
defined  as  the  burden  (Tg)  divided  by  the  mean  global  sink
(Tg/yr) for a gas in steady state (i.e., with unchanging burden).
This  quantity  was  defined  as  both  “lifetime” and  “turnover
time” in the SAR (see also Bolin and Rodhe, 1973). Lifetimes
calculated in this manner are listed in Table 4.1. A corollary of
this definition is that, when in steady state (i.e., source strength
=  sink  strength), the  atmospheric  burden  of  a  gas  equals  the
product of its lifetime and its emissions. A further corollary is
that  the  integrated  atmospheric  abundance  following  a  single
emission is equal to the product of its steady-state lifetime for
that emission pattern and the amount emitted (Prather, 1996).
This latter, new result since the SAR supports the market-basket
approach  of  aggregating  the  direct  emissions  of  different
greenhouse  gases  with  a  GWP  (Global  Warming  Potential)
weighting.

The atmospheric lifetime is basically a scale factor relating
(i) constant emissions (Tg/yr) to a steady-state burden (Tg), or
(ii) an emission pulse (Tg) to the time-integrated burden of that
pulse (Tg/yr). The lifetime is often additionally assumed to be
a constant, independent of the sources; and it is also taken to
represent the decay time (e-fold) of a perturbation. These latter
assumptions  apply  rigorously  only  for  a  gas  whose  local
chemical lifetime is constant in space and time, such as for the
noble  gas  radon, whose  lifetime  is  fixed  by  the  rate  of  its
radioactive decay. In such a case the mean atmospheric lifetime
equals the local lifetime: the lifetime that relates source strength
to global burden is exactly the decay time of a perturbation. 

This  general  applicability  of  the  atmospheric  lifetime
breaks down for those greenhouse gases and pollutants whose
chemical losses vary in space and time. NOx, for instance, has
a local lifetime of <1 day in the lower troposphere, but >5 days
in the upper troposphere; and both times are less than the time
required  for  vertical  mixing  of  the  troposphere.  In  this  case
emission  of  NOx into  the  upper  troposphere  will  produce  a
larger  atmospheric  burden  than  the  same  emission  into  the
lower  troposphere.  Consequently, the  definition  of  the
atmospheric lifetime of NOx is not unique and depends on the
location (and season) of its emissions. The same is true for any
gas whose local lifetime is variable and on average shorter than
about 0.5 year, i.e., the decay time of a north-south difference
between hemispheres representing one of the longer time-scales
for  tropospheric  mixing.  The  majority  of  greenhouse  gases
considered here have atmospheric lifetimes greater than 2 years,
much  longer  than  tropospheric  mixing  times;  and  hence  their
lifetimes are not significantly altered by the location of sources

within the troposphere. When lifetimes are reported for gases in
Table  4.1, it  is  assumed  that  the  gases  are  uniformly  mixed
throughout  the  troposphere.  This  assumption  is  unlikely  for
gases  with  lifetimes  <1  year, and  reported  values  must  be
viewed only as approximations.

Some  gases  have  chemical  feedbacks  that  change  their
lifetimes. For example, the increasing CH4 abundance leads to
a longer lifetime for CH4 (Prather et al., 1995; Schimel et al.,
1996).  A  chemical  feedback  with  opposite  effect  has  been
identified  for  N2O  where  a  greater  N2O  burden  leads  to
increases  in  stratospheric  NOx which  in  turn  depletes  mid-
stratospheric ozone. This ozone loss enhances the UV, and as a
consequence N2O is photolysed more rapidly (Prather, 1998).
Such  feedbacks  cause  the  time-scale  of  a  perturbation,
henceforth called perturbation lifetime (PT), to differ from the
global atmospheric lifetime (LT). In the limit of small perturba-
tions, the relation between the perturbation lifetime of a gas and
its  global  atmospheric  lifetime  can  be  derived  from  a  simple
budget relationship as PT = LT / (1 −s), where the sensitivity
coefficient  s  =  ∂ln(LT)  /  ∂ln(B)  and  B =  burden.  Without  a
feedback  on  lifetime, s =  0, and  PT is  identical  to  LT.  The
product, PT times  a  sustained  change  in  emission, gives  the
resulting change in the burden. The ratio of PT/LT adopted here
for CH4, 1.4, is based on recent model studies (see Section 4.4)
and is consistent with the SAR results. 

To  evaluate  the  total  greenhouse  effect  of  a  given  gas
molecule, one needs to know, first, how long it remains in the
atmosphere and, second, how it interacts chemically with other
molecules. This effect is calculated by injecting a pulse of that
gas  (e.g., 1  Tg)  into  the  atmosphere  and  watching  the  added
abundance  decay  as  simulated  in  a  CTM.  This  decay  is
represented  by  a  sum  of  exponential  functions, each  with  its
own decay time. These exponential functions are the chemical
modes  of  the  linearised  chemistry-transport  equations  of  the
CTM (Prather, 1996). In the case of a CH4 addition, the longest-
lived mode has an e-fold time of 12 years, close to the pertur-
bation  lifetime  (PT)  of  CH4, and  carries  most  of  the  added
burden. (This e-fold time was called the adjustment time in the
SAR.)  In  the  case  of  a  CO  addition, this  same  mode  is  also
excited, but at a reduced amplitude (Prather, 1996; Daniel and
Solomon, 1998).  The  pulse  of  added  CO, by  causing  the
concentration of OH to decrease and thus the lifetime of CH4 to
increase temporarily, causes a build-up of CH4 while the added
burden of CO persists. After the initial period of a few months
defined  by  the  CO  photochemical  lifetime, this  built-up  CH4
then decays in the same manner as would a direct pulse of CH4.
Similarly, an addition of NOx (e.g., from aviation; see Isaksen
and Jackman, 1999) will excite this mode, but with a negative
amplitude. Thus, changes in the emissions of short-lived gases
can  generate  long-lived  perturbations  as  shown  in  3-D  CTMs
(Wild  and  Prather, 2000;  Derwent  et  al., 2001).  Changes  in
tropospheric O3 accompany the CH4 decay on a 12 year time-
scale as an inherent component of this mode, a key example of
chemical  coupling  in  the  troposphere.  Thus, any  chemically
reactive  gas, whether  a  greenhouse  gas  or  not, will  produce
some level of indirect greenhouse effect through its impact on
atmospheric chemistry.

4.2 Trace Gases: Current Observations, Trends, and Budgets

4.2.1 Non-CO2 Kyoto Gases

4.2.1.1 Methane (CH4)
Methane’s globally averaged atmospheric surface abundance in
1998 was 1,745 ppb (see Figure 4.1), corresponding to a total
burden of about 4,850 Tg(CH4). The uncertainty in the burden
is small (±5%) because the spatial and temporal distributions of
tropospheric  and  stratospheric  CH4 have  been  determined  by
extensive  high-precision  measurements  and  the  tropospheric
variability  is  relatively  small.  For  example, the  Northern
Hemisphere  CH4 abundances  average  about  5%  higher  than
those in the Southern Hemisphere. Seasonal variations, with a
minimum  in  late  summer, are  observed  with  peak-to-peak
amplitudes of about 2% at mid-latitudes. The average vertical
gradient in the troposphere is negligible, but CH4 abundances in
the  stratosphere  decrease  rapidly  with  altitude, e.g., to  1,400
ppb at 30 km altitude in the tropics and to 500 ppb at 30 km in
high latitude northern winter.

The  most  important  known  sources  of  atmospheric
methane  are  listed  in  Table  4.2.  Although  the  major  source
terms of atmospheric CH4 have probably been identified, many
of the source strengths are still uncertain due to the difficulty in
assessing  the  global  emission  rates  of  the  biospheric  sources,
whose  strengths  are  highly  variable  in  space  and  time: e.g.,
local emissions from most types of natural wetland can vary by
a few orders of magnitude over a few metres. Nevertheless, new
approaches  have  led  to  improved  estimates  of  the  global
emissions rates from some source types. For instance, intensive
studies  on  emissions  from  rice  agriculture  have  substantially
improved  these  emissions  estimates  (Ding  and  Wang, 1996;
Wang and Shangguan, 1996). Further, integration of emissions
over  a  whole  growth  period  (rather  than  looking  at  the
emissions  on  individual  days  with  different  ambient  tempera-
tures)  has  lowered  the  estimates  of  CH4 emissions  from  rice
agriculture from about 80 Tg/yr to about 40 Tg/yr (Neue and
Sass, 1998; Sass et al., 1999). There have also been attempts to
deduce  emission  rates  from  observed  spatial  and  temporal
distributions  of  atmospheric  CH4 through  inverse  modelling
(e.g., Hein et al., 1997; Houweling et al., 1999). The emissions
so derived depend on the precise knowledge of the mean global
loss  rate  and  represent  a  relative  attribution  into  aggregated
sources  of  similar  properties.  The  results  of  some  of  these
studies have been included in Table 4.2. The global CH4 budget
can  also  be  constrained  by  measurements  of  stable  isotopes
(δ13C and δD) and radiocarbon (14CH4) in atmospheric CH4 and
in CH4 from the major sources (e.g., Stevens and Engelkemeir,
1988; Wahlen et al., 1989; Quay et al., 1991, 1999; Lassey et
al., 1993;  Lowe  et  al., 1994).  So  far  the  measurements  of
isotopic  composition  of  CH4 have  served  mainly  to  constrain
the contribution from fossil fuel related sources. The emissions
from the various sources sum up to a global total of about 600
Tg/yr, of which about 60% are related to human activities such
as agriculture, fossil fuel use and waste disposal. This is consis-
tent  with  the  SRES  estimate  of  347  Tg/yr  for  anthropogenic
CH4 emissions in the year 2000. 

by its reaction with OH in the troposphere.

OH + CH4 → CH3 + H2O

The  current  emissions  from  CH4 hydrate  deposits  appear
small, about  10  Tg/yr.  However, these  deposits  are  enormous,
about 107 TgC (Suess et al., 1999), and there is an indication of
a catastrophic release of a gaseous carbon compound about 55
million  years  ago, which  has  been  attributed  to  a  large-scale
perturbation of CH4 hydrate deposits (Dickens, 1999; Norris and
Röhl, 1999). Recent research points to regional releases of CH4
from clathrates in ocean sediments during the last 60,000 years
(Kennett  et  al., 2000), but  much  of  this  CH4 is  likely  to  be
oxidised  by  bacteria  before  reaching  the  atmosphere  (Dickens,
2001).  This evidence adds to the concern that the expected global
warming may lead to an increase in these emissions and thus to
another positive feedback in the climate system. So far, the size
of that feedback has not been quantified. On the other hand, the
historic record of atmospheric CH4 derived from ice cores (Petit
et al., 1999), which spans several large temperature swings plus
glaciations, constrains  the  possible  past  releases  from  methane
hydrates to the atmosphere. Indeed, Brook et al. (2000) find little
evidence for rapid, massive CH4 excursions that might be associ-
ated  with  large-scale  decomposition  of  methane  hydrates  in
sediments during the past 50,000 years.

The mean global loss rate of atmospheric CH4 is dominated

This  loss  term  can  be  quantified  with  relatively  good  accuracy
based  on  the  mean  global  OH  concentration  derived  from  the
methyl chloroform (CH3CCL3) budget described in Section 4.2.6
on  OH.  In  that  way  we  obtain  a  mean  global  loss  rate  of  507
Tg(CH4)/yr for the current tropospheric removal of CH4 by OH.
In  addition  there  are  other  minor  removal  processes  for
atmospheric  CH4.  Reaction  with  Cl  atoms  in  the  marine
boundary layer probably constitutes less than 2% of the total sink
(Singh et al., 1996). A recent process model study (Ridgwell et
al., 1999)  suggested  a  soil  sink  of  38  Tg/yr, and  this  can  be
compared to SAR estimates of 30 Tg/yr. Minor amounts of CH4
are also destroyed in the stratosphere by reactions with OH, Cl,
and  O(1D), resulting  in  a  combined  loss  rate  of  40  Tg/yr.
Summing these, our best estimate of the current global loss rate
of  atmospheric  CH4 totals  576  Tg/yr  (see  Table  4.2), which
agrees  reasonably  with  the  total  sources  derived  from  process
models. The atmospheric lifetime of CH4 derived from this loss
rate  and  the  global  burden  is  8.4  years.  Attributing  individual
lifetimes to the different components of CH4 loss results in 9.6
years for loss due to tropospheric OH, 120 years for stratospheric
loss, and 160 years for the soil sink (i.e., 1/8.4 yr = 1/9.6 yr +
1/120 yr + 1/160 yr). 

The atmospheric abundance of CH4 has increased by about
a  factor  of  2.5  since  the  pre-industrial  era  (see  Figure  4.1a)  as
evidenced  by  measurements  of  CH4 in  air  extracted  from  ice
cores  and  firn  (Etheridge  et  al., 1998).  This  increase  still
continues, albeit at a declining rate (see Figure 4.1b). The global
tropospheric  CH4 growth  rate  averaged  over  the  period  1992
through  1998  is  about  4.9  ppb/yr, corresponding  to  an  average
annual increase in atmospheric burden of 14 Tg. Superimposed
on this long-term decline in growth rate are interannual variations
in the trend (Figure 4.1c). There are no clear quantitative explana-
tions  for  this  variability, but  understanding  these  variations  in

trend will ultimately help constrain specific budget terms. After
the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, a large positive anomaly in growth
rate was observed at tropical latitudes. It has been attributed to
short-term  decreases  in  solar  UV  in  the  tropics  immediately
following the eruption that decreased OH formation rates in the

troposphere  (Dlugokencky  et  al., 1996).  A  large  decrease  in
growth was observed, particularly in high northern latitudes, in
1992.  This  feature  has  been  attributed  in  part  to  decreased
northern wetland emission rates resulting from anomalously low
surface  temperatures  (Hogan  and  Harriss, 1994)  and  in  part  to

stratospheric  ozone  depletion  that  increased  tropospheric  OH
(Bekki et al., 1994; Fuglestvedt et al., 1994). Records of changes
in  the  13C/12C  ratios  in  atmospheric  CH4 during  this  period
suggest  the  existence  of  an  anomaly  in  the  sources  or  sinks
involving more than one causal factor (Lowe et al., 1997; Mak et
al., 2000).

There is no consensus on the causes of the long-term decline
in the annual growth rate. Assuming a constant mean atmospheric
lifetime  of  CH4 of  8.9  years  as  derived  by  Prinn  et  al. (1995),
Dlugokencky et al. (1998) suggest that during the period 1984 to
1997  global  emissions  were  essentially  constant  and  that  the
decline  in  annual  growth  rate  was  caused  by  an  approach  to
steady state between global emissions and atmospheric loss rate.
Their  estimated  average  source  strength  was  about  550  Tg/yr.
(Inclusion  of  a  soil  sink  term  of  30  Tg/yr  would  decrease  the
lifetime to 8.6 years and suggest an average source strength of
about 570 Tg/yr.) Francey et al. (1999), using measurements of
13CH4 from Antarctic firn air samples and archived air from Cape
Grim, Tasmania, also concluded that the decreased CH4 growth
rate was consistent with constant OH and constant or very slowly
increasing CH4 sources after 1982. However, other analyses of
the  global  methyl  chloroform  (CH3CCl3)  budget  (Krol  et  al.,
1998) and the changing chemistry of the atmosphere (Karlsdottir
and Isaksen, 2000) argue for an increase in globally averaged OH
of +0.5%/yr over the last two decades (see Section 4.2.6 below)
and  hence  a  parallel  increase  in  global  CH4 emissions  by
+0.5%/yr. 

The  historic  record  of  atmospheric  CH4 obtained  from  ice
cores  has  been  extended  to  420,000  years  before  present  (BP)
(Petit  et  al., 1999).  As  Figure  4.1e  demonstrates, at  no  time
during  this  record  have  atmospheric  CH4 mixing  ratios
approached today’s values. CH4 varies with climate as does CO2.
High  values  are  observed  during  interglacial  periods, but  these
maxima barely exceed the immediate pre-industrial CH4 mixing
ratio of 700 ppb. At the same time, ice core measurements from
Greenland and Antarctica indicate that during the Holocene CH4
had  a  pole-to-pole  difference  of  about  44 ±  7  ppb  with  higher
values in the Arctic as today, but long before humans influenced
atmospheric  methane  concentrations  (Chappelaz  et  al., 1997;
Figure 4.1d). Finally, study of CH4 ice-core records at high time
resolution reveals no evidence for rapid, massive CH4 excursions
that  might  be  associated  with  large-scale  decomposition  of
methane hydrates in sediments (Brook et al., 2000).

The  feedback  of  CH4 on  tropospheric  OH  and  its  own
lifetime  is  re-evaluated  with  contemporary  CTMs  as  part  of
OxComp, and  results  are  summarised  in  Table  4.3.  The
calculated  OH  feedback, ∂ln(OH)  /  ∂ln(CH4), is  consistent
between the models, indicating that tropospheric OH abundances
decline by 0.32% for every 1% increase in CH4. The TAR value
for the sensitivity coefficient s = ∂ln(LT) / ∂ln(CH4) is then 0.28
and the ratio PT/LT is 1.4. This 40% increase in the integrated
effect  of  a  CH4 perturbation  does  not  appear  as  a  40%  larger
amplitude in the perturbation but rather as a lengthening of the
duration of the perturbation to 12 years. This feedback is difficult
