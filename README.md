# IPCC Reports PDF to TXT

This is an archive for converted Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports. I have converted the PDFs of these files into machine readable .txt files. These .txt files can be used for conmputational analysis and otherwise related digital environmental humanities projects or even data science projects. Some files are converted using original code, while others are with Abby Fine Reader 14. This is indicated in the file folders and, if the .txt file is not in a folder, in the commit notes. 

You can find unconverted PDFs of the reports here: https://archive.ipcc.ch/. I can also email you the PDFs I have on my end by request.
The original code is the "IPCC PDF TXT Conversion" codebook. Please credit this repository as "IPCC TXT Reports" if you use a file. 

NBs: *These files are not cleaned. They are also not converted for commercial purposes.*
