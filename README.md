# IPCC Reports PDF to TXT

This is an archive for converted Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports. It is an on-going project for converting the reports into machine readable .txt files. These files can be used for conmputational analysis and otherwise related digital environmental humanities projects. Some files are converted using original code, while others are with the use of Abby Fine Reader 14. This is indicated in the file folders. 
The original code is the "IPCC PDF TXT Conversion" codebook. Finally, please credit this repository as "IPCC TXT Reports" if you use a file. 

NBs: *These files are not cleaned. They are also not converted for commercial purposes.*
